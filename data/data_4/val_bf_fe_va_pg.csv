0,903,"Ignition experiments at NIF are being performed at a variety of target scales. Smaller targets require less energy and can be fielded more frequently. Successful small target designs can be scaled up to take advantage of the full NIF laser energy and power. In this talk, we will consider a rigorous framework for scaling from smaller to larger targets. The framework uses both simulation and experimental results to build a statistical prediction of target performance as scale is increased. Our emphasis is on quantifying uncertainty in scaling predictions with the goal of identifying the dominant contributors to that uncertainty. We take as a particular example the Big Foot platform that produces a round, 0.8 scale implosion with the potential to scale to full NIF size (1.0 scale).

1,921,"Imagine a hulking, growling, 8-foot-tall woodland creature so elusive that professional trackers can’t find it, scientists can only speculate about it and believers can’t prove -- definitively -- that it exists.

Hiding deep in the forest may be your modus operandi, Bigfoot, but Hollywood and Madison Avenue are pushing you -- however reluctantly -- into the spotlight. A slew of documentary, TV and film projects including Animal Planet’s current hit “Finding Bigfoot,” and a Sasquatch film trilogy from “Blair Witch Project” director Eduardo Sanchez are poised to get past the old grainy images of yesterday and give the hairy 800-pound biped a high-def close-up.

“There’s been a real upswing in scholarly interest along with this huge undercurrent of popularity among the general public,” said Jeffrey Meldrum, the Idaho State anatomy and anthropology professor and primates expert who wrote “Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science” as a companion to a Discovery Channel special of the same name. “There’s something about the human psyche that really connects with this icon.”

Campfire stories, eyewitness reports and grainy videos have kept the legend alive for decades in the U.S. and worldwide. (The mythology goes back much further if you take cave drawings into account.) And Bigfoot has been a pop culture fixture since the 1950s, popping up in movies, commercials and as a guest on ‘70s TV hits like “The Six Million Dollar Man” and “The Bionic Woman.”

Each time there’s a new development -- such as evidence of a yeti allegedly uncovered in Russia last fall or a Bigfoot body purportedly discovered in Georgia, both of which turned out to be fake -- there’s a spike in online searches, blog posts, news reports and, inevitably, Bigfoot-centric entertainment.

“Blair Witch’s” Sanchez is working on a Bigfoot-based horror movie, the first of a planned trilogy, and a group of Bigfoot enthusiasts is putting together a documentary called “Sasquatch: The Quest.” Meldrum, along with launching an online scholarly journal, is producing an Internet TV project and considering an expanded version of “Legend Meets Science.”

“We all want to believe that there are still monsters lurking in the secret corners of the planet, and that’s the allure of Bigfoot,” said Marjorie Kaplan, president of Animal Planet, home to the hit series “Finding Bigfoot. “It’s fun to be reminded that we don’t know everything.”

“Finding Bigfoot” follows four eccentric field researchers who travel to towns where there have been sightings, gather stories from the locals and set out on their own expeditions. The colorful characters have coined “squatch” as a term of endearment and say things like “It’s really squatchy out here,” to describe remote areas they think are harboring Bigfoots.

The series, which attracted 1.6 million viewers for its second season premiere, will launch its third season this summer. “If anybody’s going to find him, it’s going to be us,” Kaplan declared, adding with a laugh, “hopefully after 100 episodes.”

In coming months, cable TV will be overrun with Sasquatch programming. Syfy thriller “Bigfoot” promises a “big and nasty, teeth and claws” star nestled in a kitschy popcorn flick, according to Thomas Vitale, the network’s executive vice president of programming. Airing this summer, the Saturday night movie pits former child stars Barry Williams and Danny Bonaduce against each other in a search for the larger-than-life biped at a rural music festival. It fits strategically with the network’s tradition of over-the-top original action movies like “Sharktopus” and “Piranhaconda.”

“Bigfoot is a classic trope of the creature feature,” Vitale said. “It’s a story that spans a lot of cultures ... and it’s ripe for reinvention.”

TV has been doing exactly that by using Bigfoot in purely fictional, and sometimes goofy, ways in series such as Disney Channel’s “Phineas and Ferb” and Nickelodeon’s “iCarly,” not to mention frequent reruns of the ‘80s family comedy film “Harry and the Hendersons.”

In “iBelieve in Bigfoot,” the “iCarly” kids head into the woods looking for the creature in what executive producer Dan Schneider said is one of the series’ most popular episodes to date. The youngsters never actually see Bigfoot, but they hear a menacing growl as they see their RV drive away, leaving them stranded.

“The implication is that Bigfoot’s real, and he’s also a car thief,” Schneider said.

It’s a kid-relevant subject because “every generation discovers the Bigfoot legend, sort of like discovering the Beatles,” said Dan Povenmire, one of the creators of the animated “Phineas and Ferb.” He and partner Jeff “Swampy” Marsh wrote an episode called “Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face,” that sprang from their own childhood memories of hearing scary stories and seeing the famous 1967 Patterson footage of a purported Bigfoot in Northern California.

Even commercials have fun using Bigfoot as a punch line: A current ad for Stride Whitemint gum stars Olympic medalist Shaun White and a yeti who socks a guy in the gut so he’ll spit out his long-lasting chewing gum and replace it with another.

At the more serious end of the spectrum are interview-based docu-style shows such as History’s “Bigfoot: The Definitive Guide,” National Geographic’s “Is It Real?” and Syfy’s “Destination Truth.” Travel Channel’s “Legends of the Ozarks” and “Bigfootville” will poke around in isolated areas for Bigfoot evidence in episodes airing in late March.

Cliff Barackman, an elementary school teacher and cast member on “Finding Bigfoot,” said a TV series dedicated to Sasquatch hunting was “long overdue.”

“When there are multiple shows about cakes and ghosts, why not a show about Bigfoot?” Barackman said. “Our show reinforces the fact that we’re looking for a species, not an individual, and that we’re trying to help people understand what a Bigfoot might actually be.”",mainstream,M0d48c,big.foot
2,534,"Having defeated Arsenal 5-1 in Munich in the first leg of their round-of-16 tie, Bayern have already gone a long way towards securing a spot in the Champions League quarterfinals. As long as they don't concede four unanswered goals, they will be on their way to the next round.

However, Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti is well aware of the fact that it is possible to blow large first-leg leads in the Champions League. In the 2003-04 season, when he was coach of AC Milan, his team took a 4-1 lead over Deportivo La Coruna in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal - played at home. The Spanish club turned the tie on its head in the second leg in A Coruna, beating Milan 4-0 to advance to the semifinals.

""We are not going on a company outing, this is the Champions League. The door is open, but we must go through it seriously and respectfully,"" Bayern Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told reporters at Munich airport on Monday before the team boarded a charter jet to London.

Jerome Boateng is the only player who will have to miss Bayern's trip to London due to injury as he continues to recover from a shoulder problem. Philipp Lahm will have to sit out too after picking up his third yellow card in the Champions League this season.

Rafinha, who started in Bayern's 3-0 victory over Schalke in their German Cup quarterfinal last week, is expected to step into Lahm's position in defense while Manuel Neuer is to wear the captain's armband.

The Gunners certainly have an uphill road to climb as they seek to turn the tables on Bayern, who have qualified for the Champions League semifinals in each of the last five seasons. Assuming that they fail in their comeback attempt on Tuesday, it will be the seventh straight season in which Arsenal has been eliminated in the round of 16.

Arsene Wenger, who is in his 21st season as Arsenal's manager, has once again come under fire after delivering similar results in recent years. He received a lot of criticism after leaving Alexis Sanchez - who with 17 goals is the team's leading scorer in the Premier League - out of the team in their 3-1 loss to Liverpool on Saturday.

Sanchez, who scored Arsenal's only goal from the penalty spot in the first leg, could be one of the key players for the North London side in their comeback attempt. However, Wenger will not have Mesut Özil at his disposal, after the manager told Monday's press conference that the German internatonal will be forced to sit this one out due to an illness.",mainstream,M0b1c3,big.foot

By SERGE BIELANKO | December 3rd, 2012 at 4:23 pm

 People who don’t believe in Santa Claus are starting to piss me off.

 I mean, what gives, you guys?

 Do you seriously refuse to believe that there is even a remote possibility that a robust, ageless, elfin-man with super magical powers and the ability to travel at the speed of light to deliver happiness to the children of the world exists?

 I don’t get the whole ‘skeptical’ thing here.

 What exactly is so hard to fathom about deer that fly anyway?

 And what?

 You think elves are something someone just happened to make up?

 God, you’re jaded.

 But fine.

 To each his own.

 In my mind though, no matter how bad you have messed up in this life you’ve been living the last 20 or 50 or 70 years or whatever, you haven’t ever screwed things up nearly as bad as you did on that day long ago when you finally sighed into the afternoon wind and whispered to yourself those terribly tragic four words: “There is no Santa.”

 Why do we do that to ourselves?

 Why do we reach an age like 10 or 12 and all of the sudden question maybe the greatest tale we have ever been told? Is it some sort of twisted rite of passage? Are we supposed to feel cooler or, sakes alive, BE cooler once we’ve ‘followed the sheep’ and declared Santa Claus to be extinct?

 It’s a mystery to me.

 Just when we could use a friend like old Saint Nick to help guide us through The Age of Zits and The Prama™ (Prom Drama) Years, we turn around and thank him for his long dedication to our boundless joy by informing him that he is nothing but a bunch of bull.

 Anyhow, I have to try and stem the tide here this year; I’ve got to do my part to try and bring at least a few of you back into the righteous fold of Kringleism (that unfettered belief in magical things).

 See, as one of the few remaining adult believers (and also as former Vice-President of the Unofficial Santa Claus Fan Club, Southeastern Pennsylvania Chapter #828 from 2002-2003), I should think that I’ve been privy to a wee bit more of the truth about who Santa really is than most of you. Plus, as a father to two (count ‘em TWO!) die-hard SantaHeads, I feel like it’s my duty to try and save the last of the lovable legends before it’s all too late.

 So listen up, people of Earth! Read the truth here today and then decided for yourselves!

 You wanted the proof and I’ve got it.

 Santa Claus is real: always was, always will be.



Most of us agree that department stores and the like all hire ‘Elves’ to play the role of Santa in the month leading up to Christmas. But recent revelations in Santa Believer Circles highlight this special photo from the Sears store in Duluth, MN 1964. In it, Mary and Bobby Richards stare into the eyes of what is largely believed to be the REAL Santa Claus in one of his very rare store appearances captured on film! Why do we think this? Because Bobby, now a respected brat salesman in Sheboygan, WI swears it.

Few details are clear about Santa Claus’s youth. However, in 1993, at a yard sale in suburban Reykjavik, Iceland, a woman bought a shoebox full of pictures that contained this stunning find. In it, what appears to be a very young Santa Claus darts through a room with swiftness. Experts all agree that the distinct scoobyish hat he is wearing is found only in distinct pockets of the North Pole , giving further proof that the boy in the picture really is a very young Santa Claus!",conspiracy,C02840,big.foot

Sure, there's a bit of gloom among economic pundits, the politicians are bickering and dickering like good 'uns, and the Middle East is going to hell in a handbasket. But, as Chris Tarrant so irritatingly says, we don't want to give you that.

No, we wordmongers want you to be happy, and we have ways of making you smile. So forget boring old news, and see what fun we've brought you.

The Daily Telegraph has a splendid joke on its front page about an academic at Birmingham University who has carried out a five-year study of the ""cultural meanings"" of snowmen. Dr Tricia Cusack, who must surely be the most sought-after guest at smart parties in the West Midlands this season, wants us to build snow-women instead.

""We need to be alert to which particular images have got currency,"" she explains. ""Why is it always male, and why is it so popular at Christmas? At least the snowman has lost his pipe as society is less geared towards promoting smoking.""

Talking of snowballs - sorry about that but the Telegraph didn't oblige and we have our standards to keep down - the Guardian this morning tells us that Californian scientists have worked out why penguins waddle. It's because they have such short legs and such big feet, that's why. And you thought Californians were dumb?

Not to be outdone, the mirth-merchants of the Times have come up with another animal yarn based on academia. This time scientists in Washington state (could there be something lurking in the water supply on the West coast of America?) have identified a dent in the ground as a possible 'footprint' of the long-sought North American ape known to kids everywhere as Bigfoot. The print is not actually of a foot, but rather of the left forearm, hip, thigh and heel of a large primate. More of a bumprint, really.

Now we've got down to the botty jokes, we mustn't overlook the front page of the Sun, almost entirely devoted this morning to what Guy Ritchie will be wearing under his kilt when he marries Madonna in Scotland tomorrow. Nothing, that's what. And, er, that's it, except to mention that in its noble effort to stretch the story to a couple of hundred words, the Sun includes possibly the oldest joke in Christendom: Q: Is anything worn under the kilt? A: No, everything is in good working order. Ho ho ho.

Back to the animals: the Mirror, after pages of boring real news about brawling popstars and bawling politicians, gets down to the real biz with a picture of a young elephant painting pictures. You really don't need to know why, but you deserve to know that the headline is Botticelephant.

And there's more, much more to come, judging by the latest offerings on the Press Association wire. There's the likely tale, for instance, of the couples converging on Scotland in search of idyllic wedding locations, just like that whatsername.

And the Daily Mail is going to quiver with rage about the latest outbreak of political correctness in the forces: ""The armed forces could be falling foul of health and safety rules because their military bands play too loudly and their rifles are too noisy, it emerged today. The Ministry of Defence has set up a high-level working group to look at the problem after receiving a warning that it could be in breach of regulations on noise levels in the workplace.""

7,591,"Good news, kids! Far more companies are hiring seasonal staff this year than last, with new research from CareerBuilder showing that 41 percent of employers plan to hire summer workers, up from 29 percent in 2016. So, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find a job and help pay down that looming college debt or give back to your folks. But wait — that’s not quite how things work anymore. The summer job, once an obligation, is now merely an option among a few possible routes.

""The summer job is disappearing, and has been over the last 30 years,” said Marc Prosser, co-founder and publisher of FitSmallBusiness.com. An analysis from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that as of July 2016, the teen labor force participation rate was 43.2 percent, down nearly 30 percentage points from its peak of 71.8 percent in July 1978.

There are a number of factors contributing to this decline, but most prominent among them is the increasing popularity of internships.

“Many more students are seeking out internships or research opportunities over the summer now, as opposed to when I first started counseling students [nearly 20 years ago],"" said Dr. Kat Cohen, CEO and founder of IvyWise, an admissions counseling services company. “Everything is more competitive these days, so getting hands-on work experience or hands-on research experience, and making contacts at companies that students might want to work at post-graduation can be a smart move.”

It’s becoming more common for college students to balance unpaid internships with a paying side gig for a company like Uber or Instacart.

“While big cities typically provide more internship opportunities, many on-demand jobs are now available on college campuses as well as big cities,” said Brandon Yahn, founder of Student Loans Guy. “This allows students to take research jobs on campus as internships while still making money.”

“We see a surge in dog walker applications from college students and even school teachers who find themselves with an abundance of time for the summer months,” said Dave Comiskey, co-founder of Barkly Pets. “The job provides time outside, rewarding time spent with adorable pets, and offers more freedom and flexibility than other summer jobs may.”

And the pay is impressive: an average of $18 per half-hour walk.

But more than good pay, it appears young people want good hours. Or, more specifically: the ability to choose them on a whim.

Related: Seven Ways Millennials Are Changing the Workplace for the Better

""Flexibility in shifts and schedules is super attractive to this [younger] workforce,"" said Peter Harrison, CEO of the job search engine website Snagajob. “Whole Foods is losing money to Instacart — which pays less and provides fewer benefits and security — all because the workers prize that flexibility.”

Some employers feel that teenagers are turning their nose up at their recruiting efforts, opting instead for something easier, even if it pays less.

Jared Beckstead, marketing coordinator for Bailey's Moving and Storage, says that his company is desperate for workers during the summer — the business’ busiest time of year — and is keen on hiring teens and college kids. Unfortunately, it’s “almost impossible to find students willing to do the work,” Beckstead told NBC News.

“I would argue that the need for summer help at many businesses is alive and well; the disappearing act has been the work ethic of today’s youth,” Beckstead said, adding that teenage job candidates typically are ""willing to work for less money and fewer hours just because the job is easier.""

Snagajob’s Harrison says he hears this sentiment loud and clear from a variety of companies.

“All of our companies who do seasonal hires, especially in places like Martha's Vineyard, are having a fantastically hard time filling jobs,” Harrison said.

Many teens have the luxury of chasing the dream internship, even if it doesn’t pay — or of hustling with an on-demand gig that gives them freedom. Others may choose to forego work altogether because, as Snagajob’s Harrison points out, “there is a growing acceptance of insane student debt as part of the college process — a restaurant job can only chip away at the edges of it.”

But what about the families who need paychecks coming in from all eligible members? Or the parents of teens living at home who simply want their kid to take whatever job she can get if only to learn the importance of good work ethic?

""​Most parents realize that by coddling their kids and not exposing them to responsibility, both financial and otherwise, they are doing their kids a disservice,"" said Allison Farber Cheston, career expert and job search coach. ""Employers have no patience for young employees who focus most on what the organization can do for them. I spend a lot of time with millennials explaining the importance of humility and hard work.​""

It’s crucial to note that while the summer job isn’t what it used to be, it absolutely still exists and can be just as valuable as an internship down the road.

Related: Five Millennial Jobs that Parents Will Never Understand

""There are a couple of fields where teens can get paid from the start and will acquire good carryover skills for real jobs,” said Cheston. “Those are sales and customer service: Both of those functions will take them out of their comfort zone and teach them how money is made or how to deal with difficult people — excellent skills for real life and work.”

Another classic summer job that can teach valuable skills? Camp counseling. Some programs now combine pay and college credits.

""A college-aged person can work on accounting and payroll at a camp while earning college credits and getting paid,” said Susie Lupert, executive director of the American Camp Association of NY and NJ, adding that it may not be too late to find such a job in your area. “There are always a few last-minute dropouts or staff members who weren’t the right fit, so hires do occur at this time of year for a few positions.”

Not only can more traditional jobs impress hiring managers or admissions counselors in the future, some are affiliated with scholarship programs.

The Chick Evans Scholarship, for instance, has provided full college scholarships to over 11,000 high schoolers who’ve worked as golf caddies in the U.S and Canada.

""Currently, 935 Evans Scholars are enrolled at 20 universities, and more than 10,400 young men and women have graduated as Evans Scholars,” said John Kaczkowski, president and CEO of the Western Golf Association and Evans Scholars Foundation. “This year, 270 students from across the country and Canada were awarded the Evans Scholarship [which comprises] a full, four-year housing and tuition scholarship for teens.”

One of the requirements to qualify the scholarship? “Outstanding character.” And we all know what best builds that. Why, hard work, of course.",mainstream,M0cf59,big.foot

9,941,"Toenail fungus is pretty gross, and so it seems to follow that Jublia's Big J toenail boxing character is a bit unsavory, too.

When the purple-hat wearing big toe debuted during the 2015 Super Bowl, an AOL story claimed that ""Jublia quite literally put its grossest foot forward during its Super Bowl ad, in which a cartoon foot hit the field to tackle its bitter enemy, toenail fungus. It was certainly a far cry from the mix of racy and emotional ads we all expected, and the fungus among us got people talking--and gagging--on Twitter.""

That consumer disdain showed in the ratings, with the ad ranking as the second-worst in the game, according to USA Today's Ad Meter, garnering only a 3.22 rating on its 1-10 scale.

The Valeant ($VRX) drug was approved last June; it was acquired by Valeant through its purchase of Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2008. Big J made its debut in the first ""Fight it, Don't Hide it"" TV spot for the drug last fall. The $4.5 million one-spot Super Bowl ad then kicked off the ongoing 2015 campaign.

In the series of ads, Big J changes hats depending on the occasion, donning boxing headgear for the first fight, a helmet for Super Bowl football, a visor for tennis--which aired around the U.S. Open, featuring commentator ex-pro John McEnroe--and a top hat for post-Emmy TV commercials that also featured actor Mario Lopez.

Valeant declined to answer queries for this article, but EVP Ari Kellen spoke at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference before last year's Super Bowl, saying the drug is off to a great start with 150 reps directly working the brand, along with the DTC campaign. The marketing money will continue to flow ""as long as the growth trajectory continues and the economic returns justify it,"" Kellen said at the conference.

Of course, turning off chip-and-dip eaters during the big game doesn't mean the Big J character hasn't done its job. Sales, as Kellen noted, have been brisk; Valeant quarterly reports show Jublia pulled in $270 million in revenue in the first three quarters of 2015. -- Beth Snyder Bulik

10,43,"If you thought going to Facebook Jail for posting “hate speech” was bad – and it is – here’s a tip: do not move to China. The government there has been controlling what users can see and do online for years. For those who value human rights, the situation is getting worse at an accelerating pace.

With the help from certain high-tech giants, the country promises to lead the world in becoming the first actual Orwellian surveillance state.

In May 2010, the Communist Chinese government issued its first white paper regarding what it called “a crystallization of human wisdom” – the internet.

The white paper acknowledges the usefulness and importance of advancing this digital science and technology. It “energetically advocates and actively supports the development and application of the Internet across the country.”

The white paper guarantees that citizens will enjoy a free press and freedom of speech on the internet:

“The Chinese government encourages and supports the development of Internet news communication undertakings, provides the public with a full range of news, and at the same time guarantees the citizens’ freedom of speech on the Internet as well as the public’s right to know, to participate, to be heard and to oversee in accordance with the law.”

This is where the white paper reveals the “gotcha” clause: the Chinese policy uses “the law” to control online communications. Now we know that this law is targeting the very things the white paper promised would be given: unhindered access to World Wide Web news and social media internet sites for both residents and foreign users:

“The Chinese government will stick to the basic principle of administering the Internet in accordance with the law, try to follow the nature and law of development of the Internet in the light of the national conditions, and promote the scientific development of the Internet with effective administration so as to contribute to the development of the Internet worldwide.”

In 2011, China began requiring internet companies to sign a “Public Pledge of Self-Regulation and Professional Ethics for China Internet Industry” which purported to regulate the “patriotic observance of law, equitableness, trustworthiness and honesty.”

Signers accused of violating the state-mandated pledge to uphold the nation’s laws would be subject to review by the Internet Society of China. If found guilty, such a company could have it “membership” (read: authorization to do business) revoked.

Since Xi Jinping became China’s Communist Party leader in November of 2012, media censorship has flourished. In February 2016, the Chinese president toured the top three state-run media outlets. His message: you must swear absolute loyalty to the Party and follow the Party line in “thought, politics, and action.”

Xi was completely candid about what the online service companies were in business to do – serve the state by dishing out distorted information:

“The media run by the party and the government are the propaganda fronts and must have the party as their family name.”

Xi told tech workers that “All the work by the party’s media must reflect the party’s will, safeguard the party’s authority, and safeguard the party’s unity.”

Freedom House published in its findings on “Freedom on the Net 2016” that internet freedom “around the world declined in 2016 for the sixth consecutive year” with China leading the way for the second year in a row. President Xi’s “information security” policy was proving effective in providing both surveillance and censorship.

Another effect observed was an increase in self-policing while surfing the net:

“Dozens of prosecutions related to online expression have increased self-censorship, as have legal restrictions introduced in 2015.”

Since 2011, the Chinese state-operated telecom company Tencent has been subsidizing and regulating the nation’s largest social media site, called WeChat. With over a thousand million users – that’s one billion as reckoned in American English – WeChat is a primary source for news and views, just like its American social media counterparts Twitter and Facebook.

Critics of WeChat say it promotes “the spread of sensationalist falsehoods.”

In June 2018, a new WeChat in-app feature lets users validate news items by consulting – guess who? – WeChat employees (or volunteers) who perform the fact-checking.

One very clever ploy over at WeChat is a “Top Ten Rumors” category. The government systematically debunks leading consumer education topics such as health and safety, product recalls, and scams as fake news. Here are two examples of state-driven information control:
• An article told people to stop using microwave ovens because microwaved food gives people cancer (false).
• Chinese currency can be scanned in the app QQ to see if they are counterfeit (also false).

WeChat even has a Google-like “WeChat rumor debunking assistant” which 300,000 people consult daily.

This is all well and good but observers point out that Chinese online censors have the power to delete any and all unsavory, anti-state, and illegal articles before anyone else can view them. This form of censorship pre-empts any fact-checking since there are no facts to check.

Weibo is an online service that has been called the Chinese Twitter. The micro-blogging platform enables the government to anticipate and counteract planned protests through monitoring all communications (just like the NSA in the United States).

Between Weibo snooping and WeChat censorship, a new generation of Chinese citizens is growing up ignorant of significant historical events that have been scrubbed from the official narrative. Any private or group chat conversation that mentions Tiananmen Square, Tibet or the Falun Gong (a forbidden religious group) is banned. The user is not notified that their message was never sent.

An uneasy feeling is growing as we in the west have watched China roll out its social credit score system, spy eyeglasses, and flocks – that is, fleets – of flying surveillance doves.

China is racing ahead in the technology game, all for the sake of Communism and totalitarian statism. There is evidence they hacked Hillary Clinton’s emails. And they added a spy chip to thousands of computers that were purchased by top U.S. companies.

Now, U.S. tech giant Google is going ahead with its contract to develop a customized, censored version of the search engine to help China perfect its internet chokehold. Google employees with a conscience and a clue are quitting rather than support the Communist regime.

Things are bad in China and we predict they will only get worse. Even more disturbing is the thought that other countries are also quietly following China’s lead.

Will China create the blueprint for New World Order domination through state-directed propaganda, censorship, and surveillance? And what, if anything, can the rest of us do about it?",conspiracy,C00a83,big.foot; cancer; new.world.order
11,885,"Polish Government Confirms Discovery Of Nazi “Gold Train”, Warns It May Be Booby-Trapped

Last weekend we reported that in the past month two men, a Pole and German, claimed to have discovered the legendary Nazi “gold train” – a 150 meter long German train alleged to be full of gold, gems and weapons, which disappeared just before the end of World War II – in the proximity of the Polish town of Walbrzych, close to where the Nazi are said to have loaded up the train with valuables for its final voyage in the town of Wroclaw, just as the Soviet forces approached in 1945.

As we detailed, the train is said to have been entombed in the vast tunnel labyrinth located close to Ksiaz castle, which served as Nazi headquarters during World War II…

… and specifically, was said to be located at the foot of the Sowa mountain, in the woods three miles outside the town of Walbrych.

The “gold train” is said to be located under this hill

While many were skeptical that the mystical Nazi treasure train had been finally discovered after many years of searching, an official update last Friday by the Polish government suggested that that may indeed be the case. As the Mail reported on Friday, a representative of the Polish culture ministry, Poland’s National Heritage and Conservation Officer Piotr Zuchowski, said that the man who helped hide the train had revealed its location shortly before he died, and that proof of the train has been observed on radar.

Zuchowski added that “Information about where this train is and what its contents are were revealed on the deathbed of a person who had knowledge of the secret of this train.’ He added that Polish authorities had now seen evidence of the train’s existence in a picture taken using a ground-penetrating radar. He said the image – albeit blurred – showed the shape of a train platform and cannons.

Mr Zuchowski said the find was ‘unprecedented’, adding: ‘We do not know what is inside the train. ‘Probably military equipment but also possibly jewellery, works of art and archive documents.

‘Armored trains from this period were used to carry extremely valuable items and this is an armored train, it is a big clue.’ He said authorities were now ’99 percent sure the train exists’ and whatever is on it will be returned to the rightful owners, if they can be found. ‘We will be 100 per cent sure only when we find the train,’ Mr Zuchowski added.

The train found in the mountains is an ‘armored train’ which looks similar to the one pictured

Mr Zuchowski told reporters that the train was about 100 metres long but added: ‘It is not possible to disclose the exact location of where the train can be found. Still, he noted cryptically that “The local government in Walbrzych knows where it is.”

He explained it is hidden along a 4km stretch of track on the Wroclaw-Walbrzych line.

Mr Zuchowski said the person who claimed he helped load the gold train in 1945 said in a ‘deathbed statement’ the train is secured with explosives. The official declined to comment further about the man who said this but speculation is now rife that it was a former SS guard or a local Pole who stumbled upon the train before hiding it.

Deputy Mayor of Walbrzych, Zygmunt Nowaczyk told the press: ‘The city is full of mysterious stories because of its history. ‘Now it is formal information – we have found something.’

Key excerpts from the press conference by the Polish official can be seen on the Euronews clip below:

The confirmation of the discovery unleashed a surge of treasury hunters, and forced the Polish government to warn the population to stop looking because it could be booby-trapped and dangerous. Zuchowski said “foragers” have become active since two people claimed to have discovered the train last week and urged eager fortune-hunters to stop searching, saying they risk injury or death.

Zuchowski adds that “there may be hazardous substances dating from the Second World War in the hidden train, which I’m convinced exists. I am appealing to people to stop any such searches until the end of official procedures leading to the securing of the find. There’s a huge probability that the train is booby-trapped.’

If anything, tthese warnings are sure to unleash an even more aggressive wave of seekers now that the train’s existience has been confirmed, and the government is actually warning seekers to be careful in their search.

But perhaps what is more interesting is just what the discovery, which would be straight out of an Indiana Jones sequel, will contain, and whether someone already got to the precious cargo over the past 7 decades. The answer should be made public shortly.

12,1248,"Anyone seeking ultimate proof of the existence of Bigfoot should head south. In Texas, it is legal to shoot and kill this legendary giant ape, known in other parts of the world as Sasquatch or Yeti, which has never been discovered.

According to an official with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, Bigfoot isn't listed as an endangered species, so you're free to kill as many as you want.

""If the Commission does not specifically list an indigenous, nongame species, then the species is considered nonprotected nongame wildlife,"" David Sinclair, direction of the law enforcement division at Texas Parks and Wildlife, wrote in an email response to a curious Bigfoot believer. ""A nonprotected nongame animal may be hunted on private property with landowner consent by any means, at any time and there is no bag limit or possession limit.""

John Lloyd Sharf of Salem, Ore., contacted Texas Parks and Wildlife to inquire whether Bigfoot was protected in Texas. As one of the 29 percent of Americans who believe Bigfoot inhabits the country's remote woodland areas and is just really difficult to find, Sharf was apparently motivated by the concern that the as-yet-undiscovered creature could face extermination in the state.

""So, it is the case all individuals of an unknown species … could be exterminated without criminal or civil repercussions — essentially causing extinction ?"" Sharf said he replied to Sinclair. At Cryptomundo, a popular ""cryptozoology"" discussion forum and blog, Bigfoot believers are forming a plan of action to deal with what they see as the potentially disastrous outcome of this loophole in the Texas hunting laws, which would allow Bigfoot to be hunted to extinction before a living specimen could be studied. [ Hunter Captures UFO in Nevada ]

""I would advocate a small group of trained hunters, under close supervision and observing all necessary safety precautions shooting a SINGLE individual to provide a type specimen,"" wrote a user who goes by the name AreWeThereYeti. ""Then, once the existence of Sasquatch was proven, immediate steps could be taken to attach an endangered/protected status to both the species and its habitat.""

13,712,"Brian McBride was the sort of kid who lived life in perpetual motion. So the moment he put foot to soccer ball at age 8, he knew he’d met his match in sports. He slept with his soccer ball; he dribbled up and down the stairs in his home in Arlington Heights, Ill., driving his mother nuts. “I played soccer like a madman,” he says.

Although he may have his indoor-dribbling problem under control, McBride, 29, still has that same passion. A striker for professional soccer’s Columbus Crew, he’s often called the Michael Jordan of the U.S. game for his gravity-defying airborne maneuvers. His talents go on worldwide display June 5, when the U.S. team takes on Portugal in its first game of the World Cup, the monthlong international soccer orgy, in South Korea and Japan.

This is not the first time around on the world pitch for the 6’1″ McBride. He scored America’s only goal in the ’98 competition in France. “It was just an awesome feeling,” says McBride. (As in France, the U.S. is expected to be KO’d early in Korea.) And McBride remains a bright spot. “We don’t have another player with his capabilities,” says ESPN lead soccer analyst Ty Keough. “He’s taken what God gave him and made the most out of it.”

Yet he’s had to overcome his share of challenges. In September of 2000, while McBride was spending the off-season with an English soccer franchise, he noticed a sudden, dramatic swelling in his armpit after a game. It turned out to be thoracic outlet syndrome, a rare disorder in which compression of the blood vessels causes dangerous blood clots. Though the condition was not life-threatening, it put his career in jeopardy. Doctors performed surgery to dissipate the clot, and after two months he was back on the field. In August 2001 he developed another painful clot in his right arm. This time surgeons removed a rib to relieve pressure on McBride’s veins. “I have never seen anyone quite so sick,” Maddie McBride Bisulca, 56, recalls of her son, who has since recovered so completely that doctors say the disorder will not recur. “He was so courageous and strong.”

But he was not quite ready to quit the sport he adored. His brother Matt remembers visiting him in a Denver hospital and trying to cheer him up. “If you never play another day,” Matt told him, “everything will still be fine.” The attempt at comfort was met with heart-wrenching silence. “You could see it come over his face,” says Matt. “He was just very sad.”

McBride is the rambunctious second of three children Maddie had with husband Matthew, an advertising sales representative (whom she divorced when Brian was 4). “If I didn’t keep the doors padlocked, then he always would find a way to run outside,” says Maddie, who raised the kids on her own, often holding down three jobs. “He just never liked to be still.”

He was also a natural on the field. After stellar high school and college careers—he was a two-time All-American at Saint Louis University—he landed a professional gig in Wolfsburg, Germany, where he was disappointed to find that many of his fellow players treated the sport he loved as a mere occupation. “You weren’t supposed to be happy,” he says. “You were supposed to be doing your job.”

He was thrilled to return to the U.S., where in 1996 the Crew picked him as the first player in the fledgling Major League Soccer’s inaugural draft. Turns out his bout with illness was also an opportunity of sorts. Recuperating from his first surgery back in Arlington Heights, he ran into Dina Barnett, a childhood acquaintance who was going through a divorce. “He was the most caring and loving person I’d ever met,” she recalls of their first meeting. Last February they married, making McBride stepfather to Dina’s daughter Ashley, nearly 2.

Fully recovered, McBride relishes being a dad, but with the heavy travel schedule of his pro team as well as the U.S. national team, he gets only limited time with the family. Still, he is getting back a little bit of what he dished out as a kid. “Ashley’s so active—she’s always running around,” he says. “But if she wants to learn soccer, I’ll help.”",mainstream,M132b8,big.foot
14,123,"In the 12th century, foot binding had become much more widespread, and by the early Qing Dynasty (in the mid-17th century), every girl who wished to marry had her feet bound. The only people who didn't bind their feet were the very poor, ethnic Hakka people, and women who worked in fishing because they had needed to have normal feet in order to balance themselves on boats.

At what age did girls get their feet bound? What did the practice entail?



 Girls would have their feet bound between the ages of four and six; any younger, the girls couldn't endure the pain, and by the time they were older than six their feet had already grown too large. Four to six was the ideal age because you could reason with the girls and help them deal with the pain. Foot binding would occur in a ritualistic ceremony accompanied by other traditions intending to ward of bad luck.

The procedure entailed bending the girls' toes underneath the sole, using very long ribbons to wrap their feet all the way to the ankle. Basically, the idea was to keep breaking the foot whenever it grew too large, a process that usually took between two and three years. Then the feet would be bound for the rest of the girl's life.

The girls, naturally, developed a peculiar way of walking—almost as if they had hooves. And in order to facilitate moving around, women with bound feet developed strong muscles in their hips, thighs, and buttocks, so much so that these characteristics were considered physically attractive to the Chinese men of the era.

When did foot binding go out of favor?

In the 19th century, toward the end of the Qing Dynasty, Western countries effectively colonized China and many Western people began to move to the country. This coincided with the height of foot binding, when the practice was most prevalent. So many Western women, especially the wives of Christian missionaries, became strong advocates against the practice, producing pamphlets and even opening shelters in support of afflicted women. Around the same time, Chinese intellectuals who had studied abroad in Europe and in North America returned to China and stated their support for abolishment. So by the time Pearl Buck was writing in 1923, after the Qing Dynasty had fallen, the practice had become unfashionable.

This change in fashion suddenly had a perverse side effect: a lot of girls who had had their feet bound in order to become marriageable suddenly found themselves abandoned by their husbands because foot binding was no longer fashionable. Worse, in bigger cities some people would catch women with bound feet and cut off their bindings, a humiliation because these women would never, ever show their bare feet to anyone—not even their husbands. For them, the process that began with a lot of pain and tears likewise ended with pain and tears.",mainstream,M13335,big.foot
15,462,"Police in South Carolina are warning cryptozoology enthusiasts who think they've spotted Bigfoot, not to take potshots at the creature.

The Greenville Police Department, in Greenville, South Carolina, posted the tongue-in-cheek warning on its Facebook page on Tuesday morning.

It came the day after a report surfaced about an alleged Bigfoot close encounter in neighboring North Carolina.

The police Facebook post was equal parts poking fun and straight up 'don't shoot!' safety advice for its community.

In the post, police exhorted: 'If you see Bigfoot, please do not shoot at him/her, as you'll most likely be wounding a fun-loving and well-intentioned person, sweating in a gorilla costume.'

The post also stated, tongue-firmly-in-cheek that after having reviewed shaky video of an apparent Bigfoot sighting from 2015, 'we can say with some confidence that proof of Bigfoot still eludes us.'

The police linked to the video, which showed a Yorkie trying to scare off a two-footed, rapidly moving entity in daylight.

The Greenville police's Bigfoot warning went up the day after the Charlotte Observer revealed that a member of a Bigfoot-watching group claimed to have had an encounter with a 'large bipedal animal covered in hair,' on Friday night at about 11pm, in a wooded area in North Carolina's McDowell County.

John Bruner, of Bigfoot 911, reported that at the time of the apparent sighting, he and six others were in the woods, spreading out glow sticks in hopes of attracting Bigfoot's attention.

According to the Charlotte Observer, Bruner wrote in a Facebook post that, 'I turned on my headlamp and saw a large bi-pedal animal covered in hair.' He described the creature as having had a smooth, solid black face and shaggy hair.

Bruner noted that he chased the creature and had a 'stare-down' with it, before it disappeared deeper into the woods.

Bigfoot sighting reports in the Carolinas are common, with multiple reports circulating around Bigfoot enthusiasts Facebook groups and drawing enough attention from professional Bigfoot hunters to warrant filming episodes of TV series in the area.

Laws regarding the shooting of Bigfoot and other similar cryptids vary by state.

Mental Floss reported, for example, that killing Bigfoot is expressly outlawed in Skamania County, Washington, but it's technically legal to hunt and kill one in Texas because the cryptid is not on the state's recognized official species list.",mainstream,M0d7cd,big.foot

17,737,"Bigfoot and Mineworm sound like cartoon characters. They are, in fact, the names of two mechanical giants designed to make people safer from the estimated 60 million land mines scattered around the world. Working in tandem, the pair destroy mines in ways that are faster and safer � and more ecofriendly and cost-effective � than any system to date.""By the end of this year,"" says inventor Bob French, ""we will have the first two machines in Bosnia-Herzegovina."" There, with the continued assistance of the British government's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (dera), Bigfoot and Mineworm will help to destroy some of the estimated 1 million mines left over from the 1992-95 war. Mines continue to kill up to 10 people there each month.The idea for Bigfoot and Mineworm began in early 1997, when Leicestershire-based French watched a television report of the Princess of Wales' trip to central Angola. As Diana inspected a minefield, wearing a flak jacket and face shield, French's eye was drawn to those working nearby. ""People were poking sticks in the ground,"" he recalls, using the same mine-clearance methods he saw during his Royal Air Force service decades earlier, in Borneo and Sarawak.""Mines are unsophisticated weapons and they need an unsophisticated method of dealing with them,"" says French, who has a broad industrial background in electronics. After research and consultation with mine clearers, he concluded that two remote-controlled and camera-equipped machines were needed. The first, Bigfoot, has piston-driven armored feet that stamp every square centimeter of ground that the machine passes over, detonating any mines. Bigfoot has no need of minefield maps, and its system of shock absorption, blast deflection and energy dissipation prevents damage from antipersonnel devices. If larger, antitank mines damage one of the feet, a replacement can be installed in the field.Trailing in Bigfoot's wake, Mineworm excavates up to 55 cm of soil. It removes and crushes all unexploded ordnance, including faulty mines, sorts out ferrous metal for further inspection and � unlike its heavier military predecessors � returns noncompacted soil to the ground, allowing crop planting and growth. Having passed initial tests in the U.K., the 5-ton prototypes of French's Land Mine Disposal System (LMDS) are being fined-tuned to make them smaller so they can be more easily transported and maneuvered on country roads and bridges. After a three-month field trial in Bosnia � in which teams of mine clearers using dogs will follow the machines to verify that nothing is missed � they are expected to remain at work there. ""It's pretty certain that the prototype does what Bob says it will,"" says Colin Lowe, project manager for dera's Countermine Warfare Research Team, which oversaw two weeks of trials on sandy hills, clay soil and mud in England. ""No one machine is going to clear the world of mines,"" says Lowe, but French's system takes a ""golf-bag approach,"" using different tools for different tasks on different terrains. Pat Banks, an independent land mines consultant working in Bosnia � where fewer than 60 sq km were cleared last year � considers the machines ""absolutely essential."" Depending on terrain, they can clear up to 500 sq m in an hour; a human team could cover perhaps 200 sq m in a day.Initial development funds for French's prototypes came from a business friend, Rupert King. Today, the LMDS is supported by Redbus Investments, set up in 1998 by entrepreneur Cliff Stanford. ""This British solution to a global tragedy is testament to the wealth of innovation that exists in this country,"" Stanford says. ""We now need governments and aid agencies to come on board and get Bigfoot and Mineworm in the field."" Given the speed at which the LMDS can clear mines, French argues, international donors such as the European Union, the U.S. and Canada ""would get more for their aid dollars."" The cost of the two machines � plus attachments, spare parts, training and field support � would be about $750,000 in the first year, he says, but then would drop to about $300,000.While Bigfoot and Mineworm are being prepared for Bosnia, French is making his own plans. He wants to play football with local children in a field that his machines have made safe. Even farther down that unmined road, he says, he'd like to go out of business � in a world that no longer has any land mines.",mainstream,M0d42c,big.foot
18,532,"It was hailed as ""definitive evidence"" that Bigfoot existed. The discovery of ""something large, hairy and frozen in ice"" in woods in America by a heroic police officer made international headlines and attracted interest from a team who have been earnestly searching for the legendary ape-like beast for years.

They purchased the remains for an undisclosed fee and set about the delicate process of thawing the body. So it is hard to imagine just how disappointing it must have been to discover, not Sasquatch, but a rubber gorilla suit.

Steve Kulls, of Squatchdetective.com and host of Squatchdetective Radio, revealed the bad news: Matt Whitton, a police officer on leave after being shot while on duty, and Rick Dyer, a former Georgia corrections officer, had achieved fame on a global scale with a hoax of breathtaking transparency.

As they held a much publicised press conference in California on 15 August about their alleged discovery in the wooded hills of Georgia, near a remote region where sightings of the creature are often reported, Whitton had insisted: ""Everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words.""

The pair, who were offering weekend Bigfoot tracking expeditions for about £250, described the creature as a 7ft 7in, male, weighing over 560lb (255kg), with huge human-like feet and reddish hair.

Hundreds of thousands watched videos of the remains posted on YouTube. People started to believe.

Mr Kulls said: ""A police officer of seven years, on medical leave, labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty, got up in front of the world and told the world of how he and Mr Dyer uncovered this creature,"" he said.

""On August 16, the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the Searching For Bigfoot Team.

""The ice was being thawed slowly without aid, to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse. We estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1,500lbs and it would take several days or longer to thaw completely.

""The following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed. I extracted some from the alleged corpse, examined it and had some concerns.""

The team decided to burn a sample which they said ""melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair"".

""We began an expedited melting process. Within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head... I was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm, but unusually hollow in one small section. This was yet another ominous sign,"" Mr Kulls said.

""Within the next hour of thaw, a break appeared up near the feet area. As the team and I began examining this area near the feet, I observed the foot which looked unnatural, reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot.

""Later that day, we were informed that Mr Whitton and Mr Dyer had admitted it was a costume.""

Phone calls to Whitton and Dyer went unreturned yesterday, but a voicemail recording for their Bigfoot Tip Line, which also proclaims they are searching for leprechauns and the Loch Ness monster, has been updated with the information about a new search for ""big cats and dinosaurs"".

""If you see any of those, give us a call,"" it says.",mainstream,M0d1dc,big.foot
19,723,"Marion, North Carolina (CNN) A huge crowd of people had gathered on the lawn of the McDowell County Courthouse Saturday when an ape-like creature in a T-shirt bounded through the cheering onlookers and joined Marion Mayor Steve Little on stage.

""This morning I have this special proclamation,"" Little said, holding up a document with his signature and a gold seal at the bottom. He read aloud.

""I do hereby proclaim today, Saturday, September 8, 2018, that Bigfoot is the official animal of the city of Marion, North Carolina,"" Little said, as the costumed Bigfoot clapped enthusiastically.

Thus began the inaugural Western North Carolina Bigfoot Festival in this town near the Blue Ridge Mountains about 40 miles east of Asheville.

Mayor Steve Little presented Bigfoot with a declaration naming him Marion's official animal for the day.

Converging on Marion were thousands of believers and skeptics alike, united in their celebration of a cryptozoological mystery that has fascinated people for decades.

""Bigfoot is real,"" said festival organizer John Bruner, ""and we want to bring awareness to that and bring more people to the table to get this mystery solved.""

Bruner is part of something called the Bigfoot 911 research team, which investigates purported Bigfoot sightings and evidence. He has lived in Marion all his life and said he decided to stage the festival after the town's business association approached him with the idea.

""And, at the same time,"" he added, ""we want to have fun and fellowship with our fellow citizens and our visitors.""

If you ignored the Bigfoot T-shirts, the Bigfoot artwork and the occasional costumed Bigfoot, the festival seemed like any a small Southern city might hold at the tail end of summer.

The day started with a 5K before three blocks of downtown Marion's Main Street were closed to vehicles for the day. Vendors from North Carolina and beyond sold everything from knit hats to jewelry. There was barbecue, Chick-fil-A, funnel cakes, shaved ice and plenty of beer for parents who sought refuge in the shade as their kids frolicked in bouncy houses.

The legendary Bigfoot -- or Sasquatch, if you prefer -- is most commonly associated with the Pacific Northwest. But sightings have been reported all over North America -- including in Marion, said Little, who has lived in the town for decades.

Folks around this town of 7,500 report one or two sightings a year, he said.

""For years there were people who would talk about, 'Oh, I saw a great big old footprint out in the woods — it's bigger than a coyote, and it wasn't a bear.'""

'Do you believe it?'

Bruner's fellow Bigfoot researchers set up a tent with evidence they'd spent years gathering. All day people waited in line to examine photographs, video footage, audio recordings and casts of purported Bigfoot feet and hands.

Researcher Lee Woods, who has spent a decade chasing Bigfoot, displayed two casts. The first was a massive foot, 14 inches long and 7 inches wide. The other was less identifiable. It looked sort of like a clump of plaster and pine straw, with what appeared to be an extra toe.

""It's either 6 toes, which is a deformity, or it's a hand, and that's the knuckles,"" said Woods, pointing.

""He's knuckle-dragging,"" he explained. ""They walk upright, but they will drop on all fours and knuckle-drag like a gorilla, and then stand up and take off.""

At a nearby table, researcher Tim Dills displayed a series of photos he captured on trail cameras set up in the woods. One appeared to be a picture of brush, but Dills pointed to what he said was a face in the foliage.

Two men studied the photos before walking away.

""Well, do you believe it?"" one asked.

""Not yet,"" his companion replied.

Sitting on a curb nearby was Colby Wollack, who said he definitely considers himself a believer. ""There's too much land out there, and there's so much evidence,"" he said.

His wife, Monica Fortenberry, couldn't help but crack a smile. She was skeptical.

""There's just no way that there is something of this size out in the woods anywhere,"" she said. ""It's either a bear, or it's not.""

Between them was Monica's brother, Montgomery. He doesn't quite believe in Bigfoot — the evidence didn't convince him — but said he considers himself an ""enthusiast.""

""I think it's a great hobby and I think people should keep doing it whether they believe in it or not,"" he said. ""I like the idea of it, even if it's never proven. I think it's still a good story.""

In the afternoon, throngs of festivalgoers regrouped on the courthouse lawn for what organizers dubbed a ""town hall.""

But instead of discussing municipal issues, one Bigfoot believer after another stood up to share stories of their encounters.

One person mentioned seeing an aging Bigfoot whose fur was graying. Another shared an account of seeing a female Bigfoot and her baby dash into the woods at around 30 mph. Multiple people mentioned ""yellow eyes"" and a foul odor akin to the scent of a dead animal.

Still others described hearing a roar.

""It wasn't a growl and it wasn't a scream,"" one person said. ""More like a guttural, gibberish thing.""

""You're looking at something that don't exist,"" said a man from Virginia.

A few folks who shared their stories said it took years for them to screw up the courage to tell anyone about their Bigfoot sightings for fear of appearing ""crazy.""

""But I know what I heard,"" a woman told the crowd. ""I know what I smelled, and I know how it made me feel.""

The lawn was a judgment-free zone. Many people in the crowd wore T-shirts professing their faith in Sasquatch's existence.

""Gone Squatchin,"" some shirts said (Yes, that's a verb, as in: to ""squatch,"" the act of looking for Bigfoot). Some declared Bigfoot the Hide and Seek World Champion, while others flipped the tables, saying, ""Bigfoot saw me but nobody believes him.""

Still others bore a simple directive: ""Believe.""

But when one man stood up to share his story and asked how many believers were in the crowd, only about half raised their hands.

Many of the researchers said they are used to doubters, and it doesn't necessarily bother them.

""I totally respect their opinions,"" Bruner said. ""I respect the fact that they don't believe, and I just want them to respect the fact that I do.""

Other researchers said they encourage skeptics to go out into the woods and search for evidence themselves, because they'll never find it on a computer.

One Bigfoot researcher, Daniel Hurst, said he appreciates skeptics because they force him to be diligent in his work.

""They're a very positive thing for us, actually,"" he said, raising his voice to combat the sound of a generator fired up nearby. ""For those of us who are in the business for legitimacy, (skeptics) keep us honest.""

One group of non-believers said they were just at the festival to have a good time and to enjoy the company of people who were passionate about something. That was something they could appreciate, they said.

As recordings of purported Bigfoot calls bellowed from the evidence tent, Micah Loving explained he's a fan of the mystery of Bigfoot and understands why the researchers are excited. But mainly, he said, squatchin' is something fun to do with your friends.

""You drink beers and you have fun and you might hear something and you might scream out into the woods and get a reaction maybe from some other creature — most likely not a Bigfoot — but it's tons of fun and it's just the whole hunt,"" he said.

Loving and his friends had just been to the evidence tents and said they weren't persuaded by anything they saw.

They chuckled as a member of their group, Andrea York, addressed a Bigfoot call that was reverberating in the background.

""You can say no other animal makes that sound,"" York said, echoing an assertion from one of the researchers. ""But I'm pretty sure I had a He-Man action figure that made that sound.""

There may be a broad divide between Bigfoot skeptics and believers. But on this day you couldn't tell.

Festivalgoers were all smiles at the Bigfoot calling contest, where laughter and applause greeted the brave people who yawped into a microphone, doing their best to mimic a Bigfoot cry. One contestant actually got down on one knee and proposed to his girlfriend as the crowd broke out in raucous cheers.

People danced on the lawn and in the street as a DJ blasted Bruno Mars' ""Treasure"" and Kid Rock's ""All Summer Long."" They took pictures of each other grinning in front of a ""Bigfoot Crossing"" sign at the intersection of South Main and West Court Street.

Despite the heat, a teenage boy dressed in a Sasquatch costume posed for pictures with a little girl. When she burst into tears he took off his mask to comfort her, smiling through the sweat.

""In a world where there's so much bad stuff that's happening, we need some good stuff, too,"" Bruner told CNN.

The entire day felt like an echo of something Mayor Little told festivalgoers that morning at the opening ceremony: It doesn't matter what your gender is, or what your race is, or what your politics are.

""To Bigfoot,"" he said, ""you all taste the same.""",mainstream,M08608,big.foot
20,63,"Since its release in early 2014, the big-budget movie “Noah” has caused controversy for not being biblically accurate. While that is certainly the case, the movie does more than take liberties with the Bible: “Noah” pushes messages that have nothing to do with the Bible. These messages are actually political and come directly from the world elite. The primary message? Humanity needs to be cleansed … again.

Throughout his movie-making career, Darren Aronofsky has created quite a few controversial movies with a powerful underlying message (see my article on the movie Black Swan here). None of his work can be considered “idiotic” and, despite what critics say, Noah is not an idiotic movie either. Sure, it contains giant stone monsters, primitive bazookas and Noah killing a bunch of poor souls, but the movie is smart enough to effectively communicate several of its core messages, twisting one of the oldest tales in the world to push an agenda that is very 2014.

While many viewers were upset about the many liberties taken in this retelling of Noah’s Ark – a tale that exists in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim literature – the messages added to the story should be even more upsetting. Noah re-formats this ancient tale to describe the basic premise of a new religion, one that has been pushed on the masses for years. Based on the elite’s long-term Agenda of drastically depopulating the Earth, this new religion is about radical environmentalism, the devaluation (and even hatred) of human life, and the re-alignment of morality towards a new axis.

Through its odd narrative, the movie turns the tale of Noah’s Ark into an absurd and disturbing adventure that leads viewers wondering: Why is God so evil? And why is Noah such a jerk? When Noah’s wife asks him if “the Creator” (that’s the name for God in the movie) will help them survive, Noah’s answer is almost comedic, as if he was describing a super-villain:



While the Bible explains that the Great Flood was caused by a mysterious race of Giants corrupting and “infecting” humanity, the movie does not go that route. Instead, it repeatedly tells us that humans are evil and deserve to die.

Before getting into the actual story, I need to point out a detail that is seemingly trivial, but that tells loads about the movie’s true goal: Why is everybody dressed as if they got their clothes from the world’s first Zara store?

These made-for-a-2014-audience outfits basically tell us that Noah is not about the Bible – it is about today. It is a message to humanity right now, directly from the elite.

While the premise of Noah is based on the Biblical story from the book of Genesis, the creators invented characters, subplots, symbols, images, and messages to completely reshape the tale, giving it a twisted, disturbing and wholly “unspiritual” meaning. Even if one watches the movie fully expecting a “creative retelling” of Noah’s Ark, it is difficult to not be disturbed by the bloody, violent, near-psychopathic tangent taken by the main character. I mean, Noah actually kills a bunch of people in the movie! How can that remotely make sense in the divine context of the story? Well, it actually does make sense … when we understand that the movie is meant to sell a new religion dictated by the world elite composed of values it wants the masses to adopt. One of these values is that human life is cancer on Earth that needs to be eradicated. In other words, they want humans to sincerely believe they are evil to justify depopulation. Of course, as the movie tells us, most humans do die … EXCEPT those of the chosen bloodline. And that is what the elite wants us to think. We must all die to save the Earth … except them.

Noah is strikingly similar to another movie analyzed on Vigilant Citizen: 2012. As I noted in this article, 2012 is a disaster movie that is essentially about the rich and powerful people (the elite) surviving a gigantic flood while everyone else dies. The movie was full of references to the tale of Noah’s Ark and even shows helicopters transporting various animals to giant ships. The movie posters of Noah and 2012 are also strikingly similar.

Noah is, therefore, a reconstitution of a biblical story tailor-made to fit the Agenda continually being pushed by the elite … and as usual, the Agenda is rather upsetting. It promotes the idea of massively depopulating the Earth and sells it as an ecological mission. Extreme environmentalism is the new religion being sold to the masses through fear.

This religion is not only promoted in works of fiction, it is found in real life monuments. The Georgia Guidestones is a gigantic collection of stones (dubbed America’s Stonehenge) on which are laid out ten NEW commandments.

In the article I wrote about the Guidestones, I explain that it was built by members of occult secret societies. The last commandment of the stones sums up the main message of the movie Noah:

In Noah, it is explained that humanity needs to be extinct because it is disrespectful to nature. That is not what is said in the Bible, but that is the message this movie (and the elite) wants you to absorb.

Right from the first scenes of the movie, Noah (dressed in his little Zara outfit) talks to his kids about hardcore environmental concepts that were probably the last thing on people’s minds in these very ancient times. When Noah’s son sees a pretty flower and tries to pick it, Noah jumps in to stop the senseless destruction.

That little scene announces Noah’s rather extreme brand of environmentalism. A little later, Noah sees “men” (a pejorative term in the movie) hunting an animal in order to eat it. Noah runs to the rescue of the animal and stabs one of the men in the leg. He then calls his act of violence “justice”. Yes, Noah is apparently an extreme vegan who stabs people who eat meat.

When Noah’s son asks him why these evil men believe that eating meat gives them strength, he replies:

This, of course, is not found in the Bible. It is part of the movie’s message that basically says “Animals > Humans”. Throughout the movie, Noah refers to animals as “the innocent” while humans are perceived as scum who deserve to die. Noah, however, seems to forget that many animals are carnivorous beasts who spend most of their time hunting and devouring other animals. Some might say: That is what God intended.

At one point Noah tells his children:

Throughout the movie, Noah, the “hero of the movie” displays absolute hatred for humanity and avoids it at all costs. Every time he sees “men” or man-created structures, he automatically becomes worried.

Twisting the Biblical Bit About the Giants

To further its anti-humanity message, the movie significantly twists and contorts Biblical passages about a mysterious race called the Giants found in the book of Genesis. In the Bible, the Giants are offsprings of a group of 200 “Sons of God” who descended to Earth to mix with humans. They are said to have taught humans advanced skills such as metallurgy, metal working, cosmetics, sorcery, astrology, astronomy, and meteorology. Because the Giants disobeyed God, they were also called the Fallen Angels. (Interesting note: Lucifer is also referred to as a Fallen Angel and is said to have brought forbidden knowledge to men).

In the book of Genesis, it is said that the Giants (also called the Nephilim) were a hybrid race of sons of God and human females.

The Nephilim are described in the Bible (and other apocryphal texts) as a race of giants who lived among humans. They ultimately became a destructive presence and were said to have consumed “all acquisitions of men”. In order to rid these beings from Earth (along with the humans who mixed with them) God caused the Great Flood.

The Bible, therefore, describes the Giants as the main cause of humanity’s corruption. The movie, however, portrays the exact opposite. In Noah, the Giants are described as gentle teachers who came to aid humans, but ultimately became victims of humanity’s cruelty. Later, Giants actually help Noah build the Ark! In short, the movie inverted important parts of the Bible to say that humanity is solely responsible for its demise because it had evolved into a state that was beyond repair. The movie also makes it clear that its anti-humanity message is still applicable today.

In one significant part of the movie, Noah tells his family the “first story he ever heard”. It begins with the first line of the Bible “In the beginning, there was light” but then devolves into a grim speech about the evils of humanity.

The movie, therefore, pushes the viewers to conclude that humanity is, once again, beyond hope. Massive depopulation is therefore not a horrible catastrophe but a necessary “cleansing process”. Noah himself says:

This line is not from the Bible. It comes from the minds of psychopaths who want to depopulate the Earth and describing it as a “cleansing process”. Depopulation is good. Death equals cleansing.

In the end, Noah realizes that not all humanity needs to die after the flood: His family survives. And there lies another important message of the movie: Depopulation does not apply to all humanity. It only applies to those who are not part of the “chosen” bloodline. This is the kind of the message the occult elite wants us to assimilate because they believe THEY are the chosen bloodline.

It’s All About the Bloodline

Spoiler alert: Noah and his family survive the Great Flood. But no one else does. Right from the beginning of the movie, we are told that the survival of humanity must go through a specific bloodline. Viewers immediately learn that Noah descends from Seth while the bad guys descend from Cain – a fact that is apparently VERY important.

Of course, none of this is mentioned in the Bible. It is one of the many fabrications added to flesh out the story and to give it a specific angle: God favors a specific bloodline.

Later in the movie, Noah’s father, Methuselah, is depicted as a reclusive but supernatural being who magically guides Noah through the Creator’s plan. While Methuselah was never mentioned in the Bible as having a role in the construction of the Ark, this addition strengthens the idea of the bloodline.

There are other strange “non-Biblical” additions to the movie that ultimately makes us think that Noah is not a “man of God”, but a jerk who only wants to see his bloodline survive. For instance: Noah actually kills a bunch of people.

In another gut-wrenching (and completely invented) scene, Noah purposely allows his son’s girlfriend to be trampled to death by hundreds of people.

How can a man, that is supposedly chosen by the Creator, allow the death of an innocent girl? Why was this added to the movie? Because it is continuously communicating a message: Whether she was good or not is irrelevant. The girl was not part of the bloodline. Therefore, she must die. It is not about being a good person. It is about who you descend from.

After the flood, Noah turns into a disturbed, depressive, psychopath. When he learns that his daughter-in-law is pregnant, he is convinced that he must kill the little girl to make sure that humanity does not reproduce.

Noah, however, realizes something incredible: He does not feel like stabbing his own granddaughter in the face. Although he first believes that he had let down the Creator by not killing the girl, he ultimately learns that he did the right thing by “showing mercy”. But what about the countless humans he killed? Wasn’t there any mercy for them? No. Because they were not part of the bloodline. The Creator allowed Noah to murder people when they were not “chosen”. Incidentally, that is what the occult elite believes.

The movie depicts Noah’s “divine” quest as a cruel and violent process carried out by a man who is steadily turning into a psychopath. While stranded on the Ark, his own family begins to resent him as he obsesses over the fact that everybody needs to die. While he is merely following the Creator’s orders, he appears to be animated by a deep-seeded hate of humanity, which leaves viewers with an “unholy” feeling. There is, however, a character that counterbalances Noah’s “do it my way or else” doctrine: Tubal-Cain.

Tubal-Cain is the “leader of humans”, and, therefore, Noah’s mortal enemy. While Tubal-Cain is the “bad guy”, he is ironically the character who says the most thoughtful and sensible lines, which causes viewers to somewhat identify with him. Contrarily to Noah, he is not ashamed to be human and is proud of humanity’s accomplishments. Furthermore, he feels somewhat forsaken by the Creator who left his kind to roam a desolate land. He seeks to emancipate himself from the Creator’s rule through his own means. In this sense, he is a representative of a Gnostic point of view that perceives the Creator a demiurge – a lower god who imprisoned mankind in a material world. This is why God is called “the Creator” in the movie. It refers to the Gnostic concept of demiurge, the near-malevolent creator of the material world.

Tubal-Cain is briefly mentioned in the Bible as a “forger of all instruments of bronze and iron” and an “instructor of every artificer in brass and iron”. However, he is never mentioned in the story of the Great Flood and has no link with Noah. So why did the makers of the movie choose this obscure Biblical character to become Noah’s arch-nemesis? Because, while Tubal-Cain is an obscure figure in the Bible, he is an extremely important figure in the most widespread Gnostic Mystery School on Earth: Freemasonry.

Not unlike Hiram Abiff (a leading figure in Masonic lore and ritual), Tubal-Cain is an obscure Biblical figure who takes a great importance in esoteric teachings. As a proficient maker of weapons, he represents humanity’s potential to build its own power – without the Creator. Various Masonic sources describe the esoteric significance of Tubal-Cain.

In Manly P. Hall’s “The Lost Keys of Freemasonry”, Tubal-Cain is described as the “forefather” of Freemasons.

Mystery Schools love Biblical characters who did not rely on God to gain knowledge and power. Tubal-Cain is a prime example. In Noah, Tubal-Cain attempts to communicate with the Creator – not as a servant, like Noah, but as an equal.

Although Tubal-Cain realizes that humanity is about to be wiped away, he finds an unexpected person to carry on his legacy: Noah’s own son, Ham.

Throughout Noah’s quest, Ham feels ignored, rejected and infantilized. He feels that he cannot become a man without being with a woman – a right that is denied by his father. Tired of being punished and humiliated, Ham leaves the Ark and mixes with the “nasty” humans. There, he finds a “good girl” he wants to marry. However, Noah leaves her to die and drags Ham back to the Ark by force.

When Ham meets Tubal-Cain, he finds the kind of father figure he has been looking for. Instead of a life of blind servitude, Tubal-Cain offered Ham the means to be a “real” man. During the flood, Tubal-Cain found a way to sneak inside the Ark and, while hidden with the animals, he “initiated” Ham to his philosophy.

While these words were said by the “bad guy”, he was nearly quoting actual Biblical verses. This only adds to the movie’s general confusion and mixed messages.

Tubal-Cain then ultimately urges Ham to kill his father:

Ham does not kill his father … he kills Tubal-Cain. However, this fateful act does not seem to bother Tubal-Cain. To the contrary, he knows that, by killing him, Ham has successfully completed his initiation. While dying, Tubal-Cain tells Ham:

After surviving the flood, Ham does not reintegrate with Noah’s family. He leaves them behind and makes his own path.

We don’t know if Ham managed to reproduce (probably not). However, we do know that, in the Bible, the story that immediately follows Noah’s Ark is the story of the Tower of Babel – a gigantic tower built by humans to “fight God”. It appears that the Great Flood did not “cleanse” anything and that Tubal-Cain’s lineage survived the Flood after all.

In the Bible, the story of Noah’s Ark is told in a few simple verses and is filled with enigmatic bits that are never explained (i.e. who were the Giants exactly?). The movie Noah fills in the answers to some of these questions in its own way by augmenting the Biblical tale with fabricated stories and characters, ultimately giving this ancient story a very modern twist. The same way Russell Crowe’s snazzy outfits were tailor-made for a 2014 audience, the messages in Noah were also tailor-made for a 2014 audience.

The movie basically presents two philosophical views: One that is meant for the ignorant masses and one that is meant for “those in the know”. The ignorant masses are told to follow a radical brand of environmentalism that leads to self-hatred: Because humanity is the evil force behind war, suffering and the destruction of nature, it needs to be “cleansed”. This message fits with the occult elite’s depopulation Agenda and is embodied by Noah. At the other end of the spectrum, Tubal-Cain represents humans seeking godhood, acquiring the physical and mental tools to reach the same status as the Creator. This is the Gnostic philosophy adopted by the occult elite. While embodied by the “bad guy”, it is nevertheless presented as an alternative to the absurdity of the Creator who created humanity to then destroy it.

In short, Noah is far from an “idiotic” movie (as some reviewers have stated). It manages to sell a New Age religion based on self-hatred while giving a nod to the occult elite, those who fancy themselves to be descendants of Tubal-Cain. But the occult elite does not believe in radical environmentalism OR care about human life. They are the ones behind all our major wars and their greed is the main cause of nature’s destruction. Through movie’s like Noah, they are trying to put the burden of their own wrongdoings on the unsuspecting masses who usually do as they are told. They want us to welcome the idea of a “great cleansing”.

In the Bible, after the Great Flood, God himself states :

So, whether you believe in the Bible or not, know that if there is another major “cleansing” on Earth, it will not come from “the Creator”. It will come from those who have brainwashed you for years, convincing you to believe you are a cancer on Earth.",conspiracy,C01b84,big.foot
21,331,"Inspired by Caroliens experience with the mini-108; I decided to make one myself.I marked it out on a piece of plywood in a very simple way; Just made an 18 of the appropriate size on a sheet of paper like this:Then cut a square meter of plywood; set the paper template on it and poked through each of the 18 points in turn using a bradawl before moving the paper on to its next position until all seven 18s were marked with little holes on the plywood:I then stuck a tiny TB to each point using contact adhesive and it was done.As I was positioning the final few mini-TBs; a fresh blustery wind started blowing and Sylphs began to appear in numbers.At dusk; three small lenticular clouds appeared in the sky right above the 108 but it was already too dark to take a photograph.Today the Sylphs arrived again in numbers and we even had a visit from a black helicopter around midday.As night falls once more; the sky is filled with unseasonal rainclouds..The individual TBs are no bigger than a bottle-top and yet the sum total appears to be profoundly positive.Dan.

Good job, Carolien--I'm blown away by the quality of the work! My patterns are kind of crude by comparison.Our business was under radionics assault a month ago, characterized by sharply, suddenly dwindled orders. On the day when I set up a 108 the orders started coming in as before and stayed steady until a week ago, when I delivered that 108 to Dooney and Steve. Then the orders dwindled again, for Carol and I. I'm waiting for some feedback from Dooney and Stevo, since they are also under constant radionics assault. The other business person, besides Carolien, who is particularly targetted that way is Andy Schwarm of ctbusters.com . I'm not happy that we're being perpetually smacked by the CIA and NSA this way but I'm glad nobody else among our associates evidently is.I'm making another pattern, now, and will make some trick, conical orgonite bits for each of the 108 points. I'll use TBs sort of like Andy's, this time, and will add nice crystals and spiral coils inside. Cones and pyramids have almost equal energy dynamics, evidently, and I bet the cone shape will really blast out. I don't mind the lull in business, much, because I hadn't been able to get ahead with production, so my personal life was suffering. I'm definitely NOT a workaholic.It's still early to make any claims for this device, which was invented by Cesco, based perhaps on Kelly's earlier field experiments.Promoting it is a little bit dicey because Cesco hasn't mentioned whether he favors others profitting from this intellectual property. Also, when he was last here, a year and a half ago, he was uncertain whether an identical orgonite piece should go in the center of each of the seven hexagram 'cells,' which would make the number, 115 rather than 108.Just because Carol and I long ago gave away the plans for orgonite cloudbbusters, the Succor Punch, Powerwand, the Big Secret, Holy Handgrenades and Towerbusters doesn't mean that it's appropriate for other inventors to give away their creations, of course. I'm sure not giving away the formulas for the 'secret ingredients' of our own commercial offerings, after allbecause we want to keep a competitive edge and there is always more than one way to accomplish anything.That said, I'd be very pleased if it's appropriate for Carolien to market these beautiful templates and perhaps the orgonite that goes on them. Since the orgonite is interactive I think it would be productive to boost it with gems, coils, etc., in an intelligent way.The only way to get a good idea of the device's parameters is to get a whole lot of them in the hands of people who are in a position to give substantive feedback. That's how we test our own mods before we decide to market them.~Don

In last weeks chat, Don mentioned that he had made a small 108 (a little over a square meter) to stop radionics on his biz and was making some more to help out Stevo, Dooney and others. Radionics are often used to put a dome over our businesses, to make them invisible for customers. Frequently we boost each others biz to clear these etheric fogs.I couldn't wait to make my own 108 and started the next day making a template on paper, using the picture Cesco once posted on EW (enlarged 6 times for the square meter endresult):See picture on whale.to page: http://www.whale.to/b/108_h.html However, taping the twentyfour pages together into one print, turned out rather messy. Despite my tongue in cheek effort, the circle became all crooked. Using my compasses to draw the 108 on another sheet, left me with a buzzing headache of all the measurements. I sure lost my touch with maths!So in the end, I gave myself a break and ordered a weatherproof outdoor poster of the 108 template on pvc sheet. This Dutch company makes a 110x110cm sheet for about 108 euroA perfect size for using half size tb's with 5cm diameter. It is quite easy (and cheaper) to have one made by a company in your own country - just look for vinyl outdoor poster/banner sellers on the Internet, there are lots! Many outdoor poster sellers have a download option for your own picture on a banner. All you have to do is:1) download the 108 picture on http://www.whale.to/b/108_h.html 2) enlarge it 6 times on your own computer (to match the approximate square meter)3) and order a banner at the size to fit the enlarged templateHere is my finished 108 - well, almost finished, I had to make one more small tb...It is too soon to tell wether it is really working against the radionics on my biz. It hasn't been up for a day yet. But for what it's worth: my computer screen stopped flickering for the first time in a year (I had grown accustomed to that flickering! Thought it was due to old age. Hopefully it doesn't start tomorrow again, hehe). Physically, I felt my feet charka burning healthy unlike I have experienced in over a year too. So far, so good. I will report more in time.It would be my pleasure to order a template for EW members. Since we all are radionics targets, our observations might be worthwhile. Please PM me for that.Carolien

 Of course there is a strong and somewhat founded suspicion that certain geometries or shapes have particular energy signatures. After all, ancient traditions have put great emphasis on the study of sacred geometry. But we don't just want to jump onto the new age bandwagon and get prematurely very excited. We leave that to the wannabe Gurus, ok? 

 The final kick to overcome my natural inertia and get busy with this experiment came from the feedback that some of the first experimentors gave: 

 The energy of this setup is appartently very strong and could give extended protection against all kinds of etheric interference. 

 

 Since we are constantly aware of such interference being directed at us, it was a no brainer to get us started.

 And after sticking them on and putting the board upright, just standing in front of it, I must say: Wow! 

 

 

 Wow, I have never felt anything like it! 

 

 In a way it felt like being hit by direct sunlight, but much more pleasant and energising. (and sunlight is already pleasant, I think) But this light does not stay on the surface of your skin, it goes right through, embracing all molecules of your body. The whole space feels lit up and energized. 

 Also there is a sensation of a very high frequency sound, but it's not in the ear. 

 We have hung it on the wall of our kitchen which serves as our dinng room as well. Whenever I walk past it, I feel compelled to stand in front of it and spead the arms in order to soak up that energy. 

 

 The night after it was finished, I went into the EW chat and asked the psychics if they could pick up some interference on our business, because I had a week with very low orders and it felt like one of the usual radionics blockades we so frequently have to put up with. The feedback I got from Axel that evening was, that the energy of the new 108 is so strong, it has already blasted away all interference. 

 

 Finished and klaar then as we say in South Africa? 

 

 A day later I went to visit our highly psychic friend Valda and on just telling her about it, she could tune into the energy and confirmed that it's extremely powerful. 

 I'm still ""under the influence"", but I suggest you follow the discussion on EW and in the etheric science forum.

We are pretty familiar with what 108 TBs do on their own, as we always have a few 100 on our premises.Friederike lovingly waterclolouring the designOf course there is a strong and somewhat founded suspicion that certain geometries or shapes have particular energy signatures. After all, ancient traditions have put great emphasis on the study of sacred geometry. But we don't just want to jump onto the new age bandwagon and get prematurely very excited. We leave that to the wannabe Gurus, ok?The final kick to overcome my natural inertia and get busy with this experiment came from the feedback that some of the first experimentors gave:The energy of this setup is appartently very strong and could give extended protection against all kinds of etheric interference.Since we are constantly aware of such interference being directed at us, it was a no brainer to get us started.Georg sticking them onAnd after sticking them on and putting the board upright, just standing in front of it, I must say: Wow!Wow, I have never felt anything like it!In a way it felt like being hit by direct sunlight, but much more pleasant and energising. (and sunlight is already pleasant, I think) But this light does not stay on the surface of your skin, it goes right through, embracing all molecules of your body. The whole space feels lit up and energized.Also there is a sensation of a very high frequency sound, but it's not in the ear.We have hung it on the wall of our kitchen which serves as our dinng room as well. Whenever I walk past it, I feel compelled to stand in front of it and spead the arms in order to soak up that energy.The night after it was finished, I went into the EW chat and asked the psychics if they could pick up some interference on our business, because I had a week with very low orders and it felt like one of the usual radionics blockades we so frequently have to put up with. The feedback I got from Axel that evening was, that the energy of the new 108 is so strong, it has already blasted away all interference.Finished and klaar then as we say in South Africa?A day later I went to visit our highly psychic friend Valda and on just telling her about it, she could tune into the energy and confirmed that it's extremely powerful.I'm still ""under the influence"", but I suggest you follow the discussion on EW and in the etheric science forum.____________

My previous post in this thread reads like an unbridled endorsement of the 108. 

 I would like to report that my opinion has been modified somewhat in the light of more recent experience with the device. 

 

 Following my initial glowing impressions of its effects (mostly on the sky); I began to notice a number of more negative changes in the area. 

 

 The sky became hazy and cloudless and the wind dropped; rather in the way it does during a concerted chemtrail attack (but there were no chemtrails) and the Sylphs completely disappeared. 

 

 We each began to exhibit classic symptoms of the effects of DOR (headaches, poor sleep patterns, listlessness and lack of inspiration) all highly unusual given the quantity of orgonite in the area. 

 

 It was almost as though the three CBs in my garden had all stopped working in unison. 

 

 After a few days; my suspicions fell on the wonderful 108 that everyone (myself included) was raving about. 

 

 Id assembled it with meticulous precision from small pieces of simple orgonite so there could be nothing wrong with the stone-combinations or coils as there were none (also the drawing was both correct and accurately drafted). 

 

 The easy way to find out was to simply take it away from its then horizontal position (where the energy vortex was presumably effecting the sky) and stand it upright against the workshop wall. 

 

 Almost immediately the gentle breeze returned and the sky slowly cleared and it seemed that the CBs were beginning to work normally again. 

 

 The subjective negative effects on each of us continued though and Id find myself staring into space when there were things to be done; apparently lost for an idea. 

 

 Finally I dismantled the 108 and put the component pieces away. 

 All the negative effects evaporated and the area returned to normal (and has remained this way ever since). 

 

 As I say; I do not know where to attribute the source of this negativity; given the wholesale endorsement of the 108 by a range of experienced orgonite experimenters, some of whom have posted in this thread. 

 

 The only other 108 I ever made was constructed from lawn-busters (orgonite spikes that are trodden into soft ground). 

 Each spike of orgonite contained a Cesco coil and a quartz chip and I set them in the soil (EP-style) with a hammer. 

 

 On that occasion; I remember a fresh blustery breeze starting as I had nearly completed the arrangement and initial good effects on the atmosphere. 

 

 For some reason I became disaffected with that initial 108 and eventually dug it out of the ground and threw the pieces in the Bali Strait on a trip to Java. 

 

 I didnt suspect the integrity of the 108 matrix at that time and just assumed that there must have been a conflict between so many coils set in close proximity to each other. 

 

 I do not pretend to understand these negative effects of the 108 and I realize that this is not the first time that my findings have been completely at odds with the general consensus on this forum. 

 

 I hope that others do not experience anything similar and that the 108 continues to get rave reviews. 

 

 I would however be dishonest if I allowed my earlier impressions of the device to stand uncorrected. 

 

 Dan. 

 

 

 

 





 

 Kelly has reminded me that this is not his invention, by the way. I think I was giving the impression that it is. This is Cesco's tentative presentation and Kelly has gone on to experiment with a 114 arrangement. 

 

 So far, we've had nothing but good experiences with ours, as have Dooney and STevo and one or two others. 

 

 We looked closely at your problem in Dooney's chatroom, yesterday, and focused mainly on the unhappy entity that Kelly found on/under your property. Stevo evidently got into a dialog with this one and all the psychics had the impression that the entity is an elemental who is extremely displeased with the world order's manipulation and sabotage of Bali's energy field, also not able or willing to distinguish that from your own engineering. 

 

 Francie, early on, clearly saw a witch doctor looking closely at you these days and that one is probably associated with the elemental & anxious about the technology you're using. 

 

 Bali is the only island in that enormous archipelago, as far as I know, whose inhabitants have mostly held to the older ways and didn't embrace Islam when Arab merchants and scholars went there so many centuries ago. I think it was only the Turks and perhaps Moghuls who forced conversion to Islam, which was very much against Muhammad's teachings. 

 

 The style of Hinduism in Bali seems to me like the more ancient animism that we see in Tibetan Buddhism and Shintoism, which may be to say that the 'older ways' involve close cooperation with elementals. A nice confirmation of that may be the way that the Shinto priests whom Tetsuzi-san met were eager to accept his orgonite gifts for their shrine/vortex; they immediately understood the energy and its uses. 

 

 Stevo evidently worked out a deal with your elemental room mate to let you reassemble the 108 and keep it going for three months, if you're willing. He promised not to interfere during that time while he evaluates it. 

 

 We had an awful lot of fun in that chat session, by the way. Francie's past exposure to Jesuits at college in Georgetown produced some Jesuit predators in a murder ritual, which we also dealt with in the session. I had a notion to 'offer' these child-murderers to that elemental on your property as a gift and Stevo said he accepted. We expressed our love to the elemental who the psychics said was very surprised to find Westerners who honored him/her/it. 

 

 We operate on the assumption that elementals are neither good nor bad but are certainly essential to all the workings of our planet. This is unspeakably weird to mainstream folks but when one is willing to loose the shackles of conventionality it's a whole lot of fun and also empowering to interact with elementals, most of whom love orgonite, after all. 

 

 Your situation reminded me of the big elementals Carol and I encountered on Andros Island in the Bahamas, where we went to gift the blue holes. The Bahamians on that island have gotten pretty far from their African roots and are quite churchified, so they seem to hate and fear the elementals there. Carol immediately got the impression that they hated people on account of it but as soon as we started tossing orgonite out into the very dense bush for them, then into the blue holes over the next few days. I heard them as galloping horses, which didn't surprise me even though you can't penetrate more than a few inches into that jungle without a bulldozer and they were obviously very happy that some people finally acknowledged them. I think the orgonite also toned down the churchy people's paranoia about these nature guardians, too. 

 

 Your case is absolutely unique, Dan, but I encourage you to avoid making assumptions about the devices and will rather consider the more hidden dynamics. We want to help you resolve this. I think that if the problem were rather with the technology then we'd have heard reports like this from other stable and reputable people but you're the only one so there's obviously something else going on. 

 

 Kelly did a great job identifying the source of your previous trouble and it might be useful for you to get acquainted with some traditional magicians on Bali if the opportunity arises. If the old ways on Bali were not valid I doubt the people could have kept those traditions into modern times and I like to honor people who do that. There are a few other cultures around the world who have achieved this. The Black Caribs (Garifuna) of Central America are one and I found them quite endearing. There are lots of them in Africa and rural Asia where Big Religion clergy haven't bludgeoned people into superstition and paranoia about natural forces. 

 

 A witch doctor in the mountains of North Thailand sent an emissary to get instructions for making orgonite from Eddie-san when he was vacationing there a few years ago. They didnt' know each other and as far as I know Eddie hasn't gotten any followup. 

 

 I had the opportunity to receive a lot of similar stories/teachings from Dorothy the Witch, who was one of a 3,000 year family line of witches from Wales and perhaps a longer line of medicine people from the Seneca tribe. She has travelled to over 40 countries in a synchronous way and was sought out by members of ancient, benevolent secret orders in most of those. We could learn a lot about synchronicity from folks like these if we're fortunate enough to know them. 

 

 A group of kindly witches gave protection to Carol and her associates when they arrived in rural Kenya 8 years ago and I believe if it weren't for that, the malevolent 'night runners' would have harmed one or more of them, then. 

 

 This is the hidden world which orgonite suits us to behold and appreciate if we'll open ourselves to it. Some of us need to abandon certain prejudices in order to venture there, of course.

 Research implies a sort of commitment. Carol and I have been experimenting with orgonite for over ten years and we've personally never seen evidence that orgonite can produce harmful effects in any configuration. The only orgonite that makes balanced people even mildly uncomfortable are the intentionally disharmonious products made and sold by a few disreputable orgonite vendors and they achieve that by skillfully combining elements that are not harmonious with each other. One is very unlikely to 'achieve' those effects accidently or stupidly. I suppose there will always be people who lack discernment on a level that makes them susceptible to the hypnotic effects of charismatic scoundrels like those but 'caveat emptor.' 

 

 Maybe an aspect of commitment is to decide to trust that our orgonite devices are not going to do any harm, so when we get psyched out and are tempted to destroy or dismantle an orgonite device we can perhaps consider that those thoughts are implanted rather than our own. The corporate psychiatrists in Freud's frightful Tavistock tradition work pretty hard to stampede people who are in a position to make the world better, after all. 

 

 Powering through doubt and uncertainty with some commitment can often produce real gems of new insights, too. It's always better if we discover these on our own, through our own observations and efforts, than to get them second hand. 

 

 One of the psychics noted that the corporate freaks seem desperate to find a way to overcome the positive effects of the 108, so we ought to expect a little strangeness in our vicinity. As far as we can tell, the harder they try the harder they're falling and it seems to us that this network is turning yet another corner with this new approach: sacred geometry configurations of simple orgonite. I never could have predicted this because, before, the only folks shouting about sacred geometry were high-profile, charismatic scoundrels 

 

 I guess the obvious 'next step' when seeing manifestations of the corporate predators' displeasure in our vicinity is to see whether it dissipates on its own and how quickly. My hunch is that the more they can throw at any orgonite device, the quicker it will dissipate. 

 

 Dan, I also haven't heard anyone else report bad effects from chemtrail spraying in many years, except from the chemtrails that are sprayed below the clouds and that's quite rare by now. When the atmosphere has a lot of water in it, the chemtrails seed longer-lasting clouds and this certainly creates a psychological effect in some folks. When I see a long-lasting chemtrail-seeded cloud I actually applaud the corporate predators' tecchies because it's hard for them to achieve that here, as it probably also is where you live. I think they're constantly experimenting with new , ematerials and they bring it to bear most aggressively in places like Bali, where they've lost the most ground to orgonite. 

 

 I saw one such long-lived cloud across our sky, last week, that partly dropped below the spew altitude but when I saw it a few minutes later, the cloud had flattened and was already dissipating. I like to remind folks who email me about their fear of chemtrails that there's usually one plane spewing the evil stuff in with the other planes that are just seeding transient clouds and the evil (bioweapon?) chemtrails are the ones that disappear almost instantaneously, I believe. Just about everyone, by now, lives in range of at least one cloudbuster so the evil spew is disappearing fast everywhere, now. The Chicken Little disinfo sites are the source of most of the residual chemtrail terror, of course, and the vast majority of people who see chemtrails, now, didn't notice them when they were still sickening and killing people, many years ago. They looked and behaved quite differently, then. I should probably post about that, again. Sometimes repitition is necessary. 

 

 Also, when there's a lot of water in the atmosphere, making seeded clouds possible, the atmospheric pressure is sometimes low and that's also associated with relative depression and ennui. I hope this helps! 

 

 Manfred and associates are demonstrating on ethericresearch.com how patient and observant we each need to be to explore any of these phenomena in a thorough and intelligent way. This is in sharp contrast to the way so many of us were blindly jumping to imitate and promote untested claims and tools when a charismatic personality was the source. I think we've come a long way and it makes me very proud of everyone here.

 CArolien mentioned, in the chat, that dark clouds gathered in the sky near her, recently, and she also wondered if this was an effect of the 108. After all, Holland probably has the densest concentration of orgonite cloudbusters of any country, also perhaps the highest percentage of gifted death towers and weather weapons.Research implies a sort of commitment.

 I didnt want to post about it prematurely, because going public with observations often has its own dynamics, while temporarily disassembling the 108 was intended to pace myself in the process of understanding its possible interactions. 

 

 Also, including the 108 in the reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do, for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms, as reported by Carol. 

 

 Then Francie emailed an observation that swept me in doubt about the corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove it. I better post part of her email here as a quote, to not loose words in translation. 

 

 I can already see some occult geometry being put over your location.... I looked and saw this geometry again last night. As I approached the geometry it flashed and I saw bloody bulls' horns and spring/early summer fields. I think that was the energy of this spell being made. I know biodynamic farmers still use the energy of the horns in their fields. What I saw over you would be a corruption of this very old abundance/growth/fulfillment power ritual. 

 

 In previous observations, Francie and Bob had seen my sleep deprivations derive from astral projections during sleep. Part of me had been flying in the 108 vortex and somehow been captured, by the spell and my own lack of grounding (thus the fear of going to sleep). Things felt a 100% better and back to normal after Francie had removed this geometric overlay. But that left me in doubt whether this could happen again, as you perhaps can understand. 

 

 Anyhow, all this kick-started a serious commitment to exploring my own habits of thought and disciplining myself into more positive think. As I said in the bugs post, it reminded me of experiencing George Orwells room 101 (1984), where people are tortured with their own fears until they give up their concept of reality. 

 

 After disassembling the 108, the only outside influence left was my detox program. I need to add this and risk more controversy  for this detox had a profound effect on my tendency to think in negative circles. It convinced me that parasites have a role in maintaining negative thoughtforms, for which we blame our character. 

 

 My 108 is up again. I feel strong enough to take more occult spells to test if they really can corrupt a 108s energy or see if I can manage myself now. As for the interaction, both Francie and Dooney saw my 108 more grounded now. Maybe its all part of a personal process, who knows? This etheric world leaves me flabbergasted all the time. But thoughtforms seem to be very real! Now I am curious how much happiness I can take 

 

 

 

 

 Dan, I have to back you up to some extend  that is, Ive also disassembled my 108 for a few weeks. Mainly because, at some point, there was too much going on (as posted here and here ) for me to discern what caused what. Especially the thought-manifestation occurrences confused me. Believe me, the amount of bugs manifesting was not funny and I felt like a wicked witch for the way my negative thoughts became instant reality to people around me. So, besides disassembling the 108 I also disconnected every SP and other possible thought-enhancing equipment in the house  to gradually build things up again, one by one, and see what would happen.I didnt want to post about it prematurely, because going public with observations often has its own dynamics, while temporarily disassembling the 108 was intended to pace myself in the process of understanding its possible interactions.Also, including the 108 in the reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do, for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms, as reported by Carol.Then Francie emailed an observation that swept me in doubt about the corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove it.

 In august my girlfriend and I spent our holidays in Sweden. We did some gifting there but we also spent some days with fishing, campfire ect.. One evening we came back from the lake with our canoe because there were dark clouds on the sky. We left the canoe down by the lake and went a small way up to our cottage. Only a few steps before we reached the cottage there was a small wooden electricity pylon(maybe 7m high). When we were walking directly near that pylon I looked up and in that moment I saw a lightning flash on the top of the pylon immediately followed by an enormous clap of thunder. Everything was turned into blue light. Anna saw everything in pink light. We had big luck to be still alive, I think ... and it had been the only lightning in the environment of our house on that evening. When the lighting stroke we had a big Orgonite ( 5 kg) in our canoe (that we used as an anchor) about 100 m down by the lake and a HHG in the cottage . We both wore the harmonic protector. (we wear the HP's day and night since the day we had got them). When I read your article , Manfred, I remembered that occurence and I thought that possibly the lightning had been an attack... ....

 My posting does not referr to the 108 but when when i read your posting, Manfred, I immediatly remembered a situation that happenend a few weeks ago so I want to share it .In august my girlfriend and I spent our holidays in Sweden.

We left the canoe down by the lake and went a small way up to our cottage. Only a few steps before we reached the cottage there was a small wooden electricity pylon(maybe 7m high). When we were walking directly near that pylon I looked up and in that moment I saw a lightning flash on the top of the pylon immediately followed by an enormous clap of thunder. Everything was turned into blue light. Anna saw everything in pink light. We had big luck to be still alive, I think ... and it had been the only lightning in the environment of our house on that evening. When the lighting stroke we had a big Orgonite ( 5 kg) in our canoe (that we used as an anchor) about 100 m down by the lake and a HHG in the cottage . We both wore the harmonic protector. (we wear the HP's day and night since the day we had got them). When I read your article , Manfred, I remembered that occurence and I thought that possibly the lightning had been an attack.......Moritz",conspiracy,C023fe,big.foot
22,1041,"Three unmistakable signs that WAR is coming to America: Pompeo orders all American citizens to “immediately” return to the USA

By now, you know that I was more than a month ahead of virtually all media — independent and mainstream — in warning about the coming coronavirus pandemic. When I first released projections of 10,000 deaths in America by May 10th, nearly everyone thought the idea was insane (probably including you). As it turns out, we are likely to have over 100,000 deaths by May 10th, according to what the White House is now saying.

This is worth mentioning because today we have a new warning about where things are headed. There have been three unmistakable signs that war is coming to the United States very soon. Those signs have all emerged in the past week, all with a sense of urgency that goes far beyond any concern about a pandemic:

Sign #1) President Trump activating one million military reservists with medical skills to treat battlefield injuries. Details of this order are found in the EO text at WhiteHouse.gov.

Sign #2) The Pentagon ordering high-level staffers into deep underground bunkers in Colorado. This was announced by NORAD and NORTHCOM in a Facebook town hall meeting. Obviously, you don’t order military staffers into a 2,000-foot deep bunker just because of a virus.

Sign #3) Secretary of State Pompeo just ordered all Americans living overseas to return to the US “immediately.” The cover story for this is that the coronavirus is collapsing international flights. But that alone would not justify all Americans returning from living overseas, since many Americans would just hunker down where they’re living. But Pompeo wants all Americans to return immediately, which is the kind of thing you do before a war breaks out (with China, most likely). Via The UK Independent:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Americans abroad who still wish to return to the United States to do so “immediately,” saying commercial and government-chartered flights could soon cease amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Donald Trump’s top diplomat urged any Americans abroad who want to get back to US soil to contact the American embassy in the country where they currently are to begin making plans “immediately” to get a flight back to the States.

That’s because Pompeo doesn’t want to end up negotiating for the release of American prisoners being held by the communist Chinese regime, obviously. Any American reading this who is still in China or Hong Kong should strongly consider bugging out. By the way, we were also told weeks ago from another source that China has already begun executing anti-communist leaders in Hong Kong, which now seems to be preparation for the global war that’s about to happen next.

These three events are unmistakable signs that high-level officials within the Pentagon and US State Department anticipate actions of war in the very near future. China is the most likely adversary, especially given that China probably released the Wuhan coronavirus in the first place, knowing that America would have a much more difficult time locking down cities compared to China itself, which we now believe may have lost millions of citizens despite its best efforts to contain the virus.

Notably, the Wuhan coronavirus, released by China, has managed to cripple the US Navy by infecting sailors on aircraft carriers and other vessels. This is not an accident. It’s part of the “softening up” phase to weaken America in advance of the attack.

Expect an attack on America when the nation reaches “peak pandemic” health chaos and economic disruptions

The ideal time for a foreign enemy to attack the United States would be when our nation is in the throes of economic collapse and a pandemic medical emergency. According to estimates announced by the White House today, coronavirus-related deaths will peak in the USA on April 12th, but lockdowns will continue through the end of April, causing financial reverberations to echo across the nation for many months yet to come.

The White House currently expects up to 240,000 Americans to die from the coronavirus over the next several months. (Our own estimates top out at just 90,000 fatalities, by the way.)

Due to the coronavirus crunch, joblessness, homelessness and rising social unrest will sow chaos across the landscape of America for the remainder of the year (and well into 2021), and that doesn’t even count whatever political chaos might be added to the mix surrounding the coming November elections. Plus, there are food shortages that are starting to become very real, while a massive wave of price inflation for consumer goods will appear soon thanks to the trillions of dollars in bailout money that Trump and the Fed just threw at the economy.

With one-third of the US Congress now run by communist China — and most of the left-wing media making excuses for China and trying to shift the coronavirus blame to Trump — it’s clear that China’s longstanding desire to infiltrate and destroy the United States of America has reached a tipping point. They will likely pull the trigger soon, which could mean economic warfare (selling all US debt and announcing a new gold-backed world reserve currency), kinetic warfare (an actual land invasion of Chinese troops hitting the beaches in California), nuclear warfare (or an EMP weapon detonated above North America), or even new waves of biological warfare (SARS-cov-3, SARS-cov-4, etc.). And don’t forget cyber warfare, a favorite of the tech-savvy communist regime.

We don’t know exactly what’s coming, but we know the leadership in America believes something big is about to happen. Otherwise, none of the actions listed above would have been taken.

Ramp up your preparedness to a whole new level, if you can

Prepare for all the following, just in case one or more happen:
• A blackout of all internet and phone communications
• Foreign troops invading the US, including through the Mexico border
• Attempted assassination of President Trump, or a possible “civil war” inside the Pentagon
• The possibility of mass arrests of deep state traitors who are Chinese collaborators, such as Sen. Feinstein, Gov. Newsom, etc.

We cannot be certain that any of these will happen, and we hope none of them do. But there are giant red flashing warning signs just screaming out that something big is about to go down. The only two scenarios that make sense are a WAR with a foreign enemy or possibly the initiation of a domestic civil war (or perhaps both).

If you thought encountering a purchase limit on toilet paper was the worst problem you might encounter this year, think again. JR Nyquist explains why China is just itching to destroy the United States and has long been planning to use a biological weapon to soften up America in advance of the military attack wave:

23,1211,"Sprite Argentina (owned by The Coca-Cola Company) recently released on its social media platforms an ad titled Orgullo (translated to Pride) which depicts several scenarios involving parents and their gender dysphoric children dressing up as the opposite sex. Set to the emotional song You’ll Never Walk Alone, the ad depicts the premature sexualization of children as a wholesome family activity.

Here are some of the key scenes:

The fact that we see this woman tightly strapping on this undergarment as emotional music plays in the background is odd. One of the many reasons this is odd: Binding breasts leads to important health risks.

Binding for extended periods of time can lead to rashes or yeast infections under the breasts, back or chest pain, shortness of breath, overheating, or fractured ribs. Unsafe binding may lead to permanent deformation of the breasts, scarring, and lung constriction and long-term binding may adversely affect the outcome of a future mastectomy. In one study, 97.2% of those surveyed had some sort of health problem caused by binding.

 – Wikipedia, “Binding”

In another scene, there is more body-tightening going on.

In the 20th century, corsets were deemed dangerous and “instruments of female torture”.

This ad is not merely about “pride” or “diversity”, it is about pushing an agenda. It is about involving minors in it and shaming parents who do not actively get involved in it.

An Agenda is Being Pushed

The gender-blurring agenda has been identified on this site several years ago and it keeps getting stronger. We know that there’s an “agenda” (which means “an underlying often ideological plan or program”) going on because:
• It is over-represented in mass media
• It is pushed by powerful actors
• It targets minors (and their parents) intentionally.

Here are some recent examples:

If you believe that global corporations such as Coca-Cola create social ads because “they care”, you are dead wrong. They don’t. They are pushing an agenda that was precisely calculated and thought-out by powerful think tanks to shape and mold a new generation. What they are actually looking for is confusion, anxiety, insecurity and a general feeling of disconnection towards everything that is real. And they are succeeding.

US Suicide Pilot Joe Stack Named First “Gray Champion” Of 21st Century

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

In a move sure to bring both shock and fear to the ruling classes of , especially their government officials, the American Patriot Community has named suicide pilot Joe Stack as their “first Gray Champion of the 21st Century”.

According to the American Patriot website GrayChampion.Com, by Joe Stack’s piloting his plane into the Echelon Federal Building this past week he “has fired the first shot in the New American Revolution.”

“Gray Champion’s are also those rarest of Americans, arising to stand among their fellow citizens to “do their duty” on an average of once or twice every generation….a time that has come, once again, as the future of the United States hangs in the balance.

The true determination of who can be called a Gray Champion rests with history as these rarest of Americans were during their times, and by the actions they performed, were always labeled as terrorists, rebels, murderers and traitors and held up for scorn by the elite classes, government officials and media barons who were the targets of these Gray Champions in the first place.”

In our previous report about the actions of Joe Stack (and actually when we had first heard of the American moniker “Gray Champion”) to strike back against a government he believed no longer served the true interests of its citizens, we quoted from his “manifesto” delivered to the World upon his death, and wherein he said:

“I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are.

Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn’t so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.”

To the fears of Joe Stack and his fellow American citizens of their living in a country whose government no longer serves them, but in chilling fact sees them all as enemies and has begun targeting them for destruction, the evidence is becoming overwhelming, and as we can read:

As reported by the ABC Television News Service in their February 3rd article titled “License to Kill? Intelligence Chief Says U.S. Can Take Out American Terrorists” they report:

“The director of national intelligence affirmed rather bluntly today that the U.S. intelligence community has authority to target American citizens for assassination if they present a direct terrorist threat to the United States.

“We take direct actions against terrorists in the intelligence community; if … we think that direct action will involve killing an American, we get specific permission to do that,” Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the House Intelligence Committee.”

Based upon US Intelligence Director Blair’s testimony to Congress, and should the American government had discovered Joe Stack’s plan to attack the Echelon Federal Building in Texas, they had the right to assassinate him instead of arresting him and bringing him to trial, and which flies in the face of every standard the United States was built upon, not to mention its being against their own laws and Constitution.

And it gets worse…

In a just released report (February 19th) titled “Bush Lawyer Said President Could Order Civilians to Be 'Massacred'” by the American news magazine Newsweek it is said:

“The chief author of the Bush administration's ""torture memo” told Justice Department investigators that the president's war-making authority was so broad that he had the constitutional power to order a village to be ""massacred”, according to a report by released Friday night by the Office of Professional Responsibility.”

To those Americans believing that their government would never result to the wholesale massacring of them they are warned to think twice, especially when viewed in the light of a just released article by the US Newswire Service titled “1,000 Architects & Engineers Call for New 9/11 Investigation” and which, in part, says:

“Richard Gage, AIA, architect and founder of the non-profit Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, Inc. (AE911Truth), will announce a decisive milestone today at a press conference in San Francisco, as more than 1,000 worldwide architects and engineers now support the call for a new investigation into the destruction of the Twin Towers and Building 7 at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. After careful examination of the official explanation, along with the forensic data omitted from official reports, these professionals have concluded that a new independent investigation into these mysterious collapses is needed.

Gage and his group base their conclusions on forensic evidence. Gage states, ""The official FEMA and NIST reports provide insufficient, contradictory, and fraudulent accounts of the circumstances of the towers' destruction. We are therefore calling for a grand jury investigation of NIST officials. Gage points out the destruction of the third high-rise, World Trade Center 7, a 47-story skyscraper which was not hit by an aircraft, yet came down in pure free-fall acceleration for more than 100 feet, a significant fact that NIST has been forced to admit, due to research conducted by AE911Truth petition signers. Other disturbing facts emerging from the forensic evidence include:

Complete destruction of both Twin Towers in just 10 to 14 seconds at near free-fall acceleration

Over 100 first-responder reports of explosions and flashes at onset of destruction

1200-foot-dia. debris field: no ""pancaked"" floors seen in the debris pile

Several tons of molten metal found in debris.

Evidence of advanced explosive nano-thermitic composite material found in the WTC dust by an international team of scientists”

Even worse for these Americans are those still believing that President Obama is going to protect them, but which all the evidence clearly shows he is not going to do, in fact, since taking office he has not only continued all of the former President Bush’s policies, he is now actively involved in protecting from prosecution the Bush Administration “architects” of the new Fascist state being created in the United States along with continuing the cover-up of the events surrounding 9/11, and as we can read:

As reported by the Associated Press News Service in their article titled “DOJ review finds no misconduct by memo authors”, Obama overruled his own Department of Justice lawyers who wanted the Bush Administration authors of the so called “torture memos” prosecuted and has allowed them to go unpunished, and as we can read:

“An initial review by the Justice Department's internal affairs unit found that former[Bush] government lawyers Jay Bybee and John Yoo had committed professional misconduct, a conclusion that could have cost them their law licenses. But, underscoring just how controversial and legally thorny the memos have become, the Justice Department's top career lawyer [and close Obama friend] reviewed the matter and disagreed.”

Scarier still about Obama are new reports coming from the US questioning weather he is even in control, and as we can read as reported by the Salon.Com News Service in their report titled “Who's in control in the White House?”, and which, in part, says:

“Recall that one year ago, Obama instructed the DEA to follow his campaign pledge and respect local statutes legalizing medicinal marijuana. When the DEA kept raiding pot dispensaries in states that had passed such laws, Attorney General Eric Holder reiterated the cease and desist decree, stating that ""What (Obama) said during the campaign is now American policy.""

As even more raids nonetheless continued, the Justice Department then issued an explicit memo ordering federal agents to refrain from prosecuting those who are in ""compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana.""

And yet the DEA has recently intensified its crackdown. Here in Colorado -- where voters enshrined medical marijuana's legality in our state constitution -- the feds not only raided two dispensaries, but did so in a way that deliberately humiliated their superiors.

In January, the DEA stormed a company that performs cannabis quality tests. The firm’s alleged infraction? Following protocol and formally applying for a federal equipment license. DEA rogues responded to the request not with thanks or -- heaven forbid -- approval, but instead with the gestapo.

This was topped last week when DEA agents arrested a medical marijuana grower who dared discuss his business with a local news outlet. Sensing a P.R. opportunity, DEA agent Jeffrey Sweetin used the spectacle to insist that he will not listen to stand-down directives from his bosses.”

Now most interesting about all of these events now occurring in the United States, including Joe Stack now being said to be one of the “Gray Champions” of his generation, is that they have been predicted to occur, and as we can read as reported by the Wall Street Journal News Service in their December 29, 2008 article titled “As if Things Weren't Bad Enough, Russian Professor Predicts End of U.S.”, and which says:

“For a decade, Russian academic Igor Panarin has been predicting the U.S. will fall apart in 2010. For most of that time, he admits, few took his argument -- that an economic and moral collapse will trigger a civil war and the eventual breakup of the U.S. -- very seriously. Now he's found an eager audience: Russian state media.

In recent weeks, he's been interviewed as much as twice a day about his predictions. ""It's a record,"" says Prof. Panarin. ""But I think the attention is going to grow even stronger.""

Prof. Panarin, 50 years old, is not a fringe figure. A former KGB analyst, he is dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry's academy for future diplomats. He is invited to Kremlin receptions, lectures students, publishes books, and appears in the media as an expert on U.S.-Russia relations.

But it's his bleak forecast for the U.S. that is music to the ears of the Kremlin, which in recent years has blamed Washington for everything from instability in the Middle East to the global financial crisis. Mr. Panarin's views also fit neatly with the Kremlin's narrative that Russia is returning to its rightful place on the world stage after the weakness of the 1990s, when many feared that the country would go economically and politically bankrupt and break into separate territories.

A polite and cheerful man with a buzz cut, Mr. Panarin insists he does not dislike Americans. But he warns that the outlook for them is dire.

""There's a 55-45% chance right now that disintegration will occur,"" he says. ""One could rejoice in that process,"" he adds, poker-faced. ""But if we're talking reasonably, it's not the best scenario -- for Russia."" Though Russia would become more powerful on the global stage, he says, its economy would suffer because it currently depends heavily on the dollar and on trade with the U.S.

Mr. Panarin posits, in brief, that mass immigration, economic decline, and moral degradation will trigger a civil war next fall and the collapse of the dollar. Around the end of June 2010, or early July, he says, the U.S. will break into six pieces -- with Alaska reverting to Russian control.”

In these most darkest of times, and as the fate of America now hangs in the balance, one can only hope that her people will awaken, and in their awakening arise together, as the one people that they are, so that when the history of these times are written, and though many of them will become their own “Gray Champions”, a new and better Nation may be born again.

25,367,"Strange things are afoot in the animal kingdom. In Sweden, a 16-inch “Ratzilla” burrowed into a family’s home and terrorized them for weeks. In Canada, a two-legged dog jogged down the beach as if it were a human. Our sense of what is possible is expanding every day – could the cryptids, those legendary monsters of folklore, have more grounding in scientific fact than previously assumed?

Probably not. But it’s April Fools’ Day, and that means we can have just as much fun fooling ourselves as we do other people. After all, the world is a more interesting place with these creatures in it.

Join us below as we explore the most intriguing cryptid sightings of 2014 – if they’re real, might they be hiding in your backyard?

The legend of the Chupacabra – a bloodsucking monster that preys on livestock – continues to haunt the Southwest, most recently in March, when a Texas family claimed to have shot and killed a real Chupacabra. With its terrifying teeth and unholy grimace, the animal’s corpse certainly fits the Chupcabra’s description, but local authorities, their hearts dead to the magic of the West, say the creature was likely a local predator infected by Sarcoptic mange.

Bigfoot enthusiasts received a disappointing blow to their efforts on March 28, when self-proclaimed “best Bigfoot tracker in the world” Rick Dyer admitted that his two-year publicity campaign to convince the world he’d killed the beast was a lie. This was the second time Dyer admitted to lying about killing the legendary monster, which raises the question of why anyone trusted him in the first place.

Still, Bigfoot claims are like the Hydra: Knock one down and another three grow in its place. 2014 has already seen Bigfoot sightings in Detroit, Vermont and Maine.

As you may guess from its delightfully folksy moniker, the Yowie is the Australian analogue to Bigfoot, a gigantic hominid rumored to hide in the Australian bush. Given Australia’s remarkable biodiversity and relatively low population density, the Yowie might be slightly easier to believe in than its American relative, particularly among the numerous travelers who have recently reported seeing it in the New South Wales outback.

Conspiracy theorist David Icke has popularized the theory that several world leaders are actually reptilians in disguise, but less cynical cryptid fans have reported seeing lizard people wandering the wilderness in their natural skin, far from the corridors of power. Typical is this account from February, in which a trio of bikers reported encountering a six-foot-tall reptile with clawed hands and snake eyes while traveling through the Arizona desert.

“When you read these stories online or watch them on TV, you think, ‘Man, these people are crazy, or on meds or something,'” CryptoZoologyNews.com quoted one of the bikers as saying. “This story has made me a believer.”

What’s Portugese for “spooky-scary?” The Brazilian Internet blew up in February after security footage of what appeared to be a terrifying wolf figure, complete with tales of frightened locals and security lockdowns, went viral.

The rumors were finally stopped by the Internet equivalent of a silver bullet: A few skeptical sleuths, who noticed that the video dated back to at least 2007. Officials in the town reportedly terrorized by the werewolf said they had no knowledge of any such creature – of course, that’s what they would say.

If a body of water is large enough and deep enough, eventually people are going to start worrying there are monsters in it. The most recent rumblings come from Russia, where a team of scientists has been studying Siberia’s Lake Labynkyr, hoping to find evidence of a mysterious sea creature that fascinated the media in 2013. (Initial reports that those divers found a large jawbone at the bottom of the lake have not been confirmed.)

The “air” inside both bubbles has the stench of Political corruption and fallout from Self Serving actions by an elected official and supposed “public servant.” (Cough, cough… wow, the air is bad in there.)

Not only is Pelosi the “Calendar Girl” (please leave the clothes on) of Liberalism, she is exactly what is wrong with The Political Establishment and why so many ‘left leaning’ voters joined the Republicans and elected Donald Trump as President.

But she also happens to be one of the body’s wealthiest members: In Washington, she lives in a multimillion-dollar Georgetown condo; she owns a 16-acre vineyard in Napa Valley and a 3,700 square-foot house in San Francisco’s tony Pacific Heights..”

“.. financial-disclosure statements, [..] place her in the top one-tenth of the 1 percent of Americans, [that] may surprise some in light of the concern she’s expressed about income equality and the distribution of wealth.

“We’re talking about addressing the disparity in our country of income, where the wealthy people continue to get wealthier,” Pelosi said in 2010 at a United Steelworkers’ event. “That disparity is not just about wages alone,” she added. “That disparity is about ownership and equity. It’s all about fairness in our country.”

At this point we are not going to continue pointing out the hypocrisy Pelosi practices in her personal and business affairs as it is available on line to even the most casual researcher. (Have barf-bag at the ready.)

Short and sweet… Nancy calls out Trump about an alleged Russian Connection without talking about hers.

Nancy says Trump is not competent to be President? Really Nancy? (More Hypocrisy)

27,756,"The sea cows were first described by the German naturalist Georg Steller in the 18th century. Steller was part of an expedition organized led by the Danish explorer Vitus Bering. Financed by the Imperial Russian government, its mission was to chart the waters between Siberia and North America, and find a workable route between the two if possible.

The expedition set sail from Kamchatka in June of 1741. A few weeks later, they had reached Alaska. Bering allowed Steller a single day to search for new species. In that brief time, his only visit to the North American continent, Steller managed to name several species of bird, including Steller’s Jay, ubiquitous in the hills behind my Berkeley apartment. By the beginning of winter, the two ships that made up the expedition had become separated, two landing parties had vanished, and so many sailors on Bering’s flagship had scurvy that they could barely man the sails.

In November, the St. Peter ran aground on an uninhabited island. Many of members of the expedition thought that it was attached to the Siberian mainland and that they would eventually be able to walk to safety, but they were soon proven wrong. A short time after reaching land, the ship broke apart in a storm, and the captain died of scurvy. Steller, who knew how to combat the Vitamin C–deficiency by foraging for herbs, was one of the few crew members still in good health.

Steller quickly realized that the landmass they were on was an island, and one that likely had never been visited by human beings before. Everywhere he went, he was followed by foxes, which showed no fear but eagerly stole any implements or food they could grab in their jaws. One day, walking along the beach searching for firewood, he saw a huge, black shape moving slowly about in the shallows like an overturned boat. Every few minutes a snout would surface for a moment and draw breath with a noise like a horse’s snort. This was the sea cow, seen by the human eyes for the first time in thousands of years. Steller was shocked to realize that this creature was a type of manatee, thousands of miles from its nearest relatives in the tropics. He describes the sea cows as gentle giants, whose only real defense against being harpooned was their incredibly thick hides. He also notes that they seem to have been unusually loyal to one another, which proved to be more of a liability than an asset when the Russians began hunting them for food. They had, in his words, “an uncommon love for one another, which even extended so far that, when one of them was hooked, all the others were intent upon saving him.” When the Russians harpooned one of the sea cows, others would come to its defense, making a circle around their wounded comrade.

The discovery of Morgan’s sphinx moth, which had a tongue just long enough (and no longer), proved Darwin right — some two decades after his death.

It’s one of the great demonstrations of evolution by natural selection. But what naturalists really want is to catch natural selection in the act, as it’s doing the selecting. That’s much harder, and a bit of luck is needed.

Opportunity knocked at the door of biologist Colin Donihue at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a year ago, just after he and his colleagues had returned from Pine Cay and Water Cay, two small islands in the Turks and Caicos archipelago to the north of the Caribbean, where they had been studying the lives and times of its resident anole lizards (Anolis scriptus).

On 8 September last year, Hurricane Irma struck the islands, battering them with sustained winds of up to 265 kilometres per hour. Irma was the first category-5 hurricane on record to strike the region, but more was to come: two weeks later, Hurricane Maria swept across the islands with winds of up to 200 kilometres per hour. Dozens of people in the region died. Reconstruction and rebuilding efforts continue.

Read the paper: Hurricane-induced selection on the morphology of an island lizard

Three weeks after the winds had died down, the researchers were back on Pine Cay and Water Cay to assess the damage, and to see how (or even if) their lizards had survived. Their study, published this week in Nature, is the first to use an immediate before-and-after comparison to assess the impacts of hurricanes on evolutionary selection (C. M. Donihue et al. Nature http://doi.org/csgp; 2018).

Serendipity can go only so far. The researchers hadn’t marked the lizards, so they couldn’t identify and track the fate of individuals. But they found clear trends of natural selection in action. In general, anoles found after the storms had bigger toepads, longer forelimbs and shorter hindlimbs than did lizards collected before the storm.

What have these traits to do with hurricanes? The lizards live in bushes and other low-growing vegetation. Toepads allow them purchase on the branches as they move, and it’s a fair bet that limb proportions also play a part in helping a lizard to keep in contact with a branch, resisting moves by predators, other lizards — or, as it turned out, hurricanes — to knock them off.

The researchers took their idea further with a simple laboratory experiment, in which they allowed lizards to get settled on a perch and then blew them off using a commercial leaf blower, recording the speed at which the lizards were dislodged. (The lizards flew into comfy padding, and were not injured in the experiments.)

This experiment supported the researchers’ hypothesis. In particular, it showed that when lizards are subjected to a stiff breeze, they hang on tightly with their forelimbs and let their hindlimbs hang loose. Longer hindlimbs, then, offer more purchase to the winds, explaining why lizards found after the storms tended to have shorter hindlimbs, but longer forelimbs.

These bigger toepads, shorter hindlimbs and longer forelimbs did not evolve as a direct response to the hurricanes, but they show how such evolution occurs. Natural selection interfered with the way in which these traits were spread across the population. Specifically, those lizards unable to hang on when the storms blew up — those with smaller toepads, longer hindlimbs and shorter forelimbs — were (presumably) blown away and perished. Those lizards better able to hang on tightly would have survived to weather another day. In technical terms, the mean values of the crucial traits measured before the storms had shifted. These changes are phenotypic — merely observable characteristics. They say nothing about the genetic assimilation of such changes, which will presumably happen when the surviving lizards breed and new lizards are recruited to the population. Such changes are unlikely to be the last, given the expected increases in extreme weather that the future will bring.",mainstream,M0ad5c,big.foot
29,351,"Why on earth would the US government conspire to cover up any kind of archaeological findings? Of what possible threat could honest, scientific discovery pose to national security or the common good?

Yet, this is exactly what happened when American diggers found skeletal remains of oversize humans: giants.

Disclose.tv reported earlier this year on a story that was ridiculed and debunked as soon as it was made public some decades ago: that the Smithsonian Institution destroyed thousands of giant human skeletons.

The World News Daily Report was the first publication to claim that the US cover-up of giant human remains began in the early 1900s. (It is entirely possible that earlier cases will be found, in the future.)

This leading scientific organization responded to allegations of their deceitful actions by filing a lawsuit to protect their sterling reputation. The Event Chronicle fills in the details:

“A US Supreme Court ruling has forced the Smithsonian institution to release classified papers dating from the early 1900’s that proves the organization was involved in a major historical cover-up of evidence showing giants human remains in the tens of thousands had been uncovered all across America and were ordered to be destroyed by high-level administrators to protect the mainstream chronology of human evolution at the time.

“The allegations stemming from the American Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during the early 1900’s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168-year old institution.

“…Smithsonian whistle blowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height, a reality mainstream archeology can not admit to for different reasons, claims AIAA spokesman, James Churward.”

Honestly, covering up the existence of giants on earth, in order to preserve a theory that explains how humans came to inhabit North America, makes very little sense: who stands to gain, and who stands to lose?

Could it be that the US leadership decided that the citizenry would freak out from the news of giants who lived in the distant past?

The Bible (Genesis 6:4) states very matter-of-factly: “There were giants in the Earth in those days” – as if contemporary readers knew this to be true, undoubtedly from the passage of oral tradition. Great warriors like Goliath (bested by David and his sling) were described, and the locations of giants’ kingdoms were disclosed.

Many other civilizations around the world have “myths” about giants, as listed in this fascinating article by an unnamed author. American immigrants brought their cultural heritages with them.

But a folk tale is a far cry from scientific rigor. So why the modern cover-up of actual physical evidence that supports those “children’s stories?”

One mundane explanation would be that influential (as in, wealthy), mainstream archaeologists wanted to maintain their scientific supremacy, and persuaded the federal government to help perpetuate the lie that giants never existed anywhere in the world, much less in the continental US. After all, schools taught that the earliest American inhabitants trekked over a Bering Strait land bridge – over the north pole, nearly – into modern-day Alaska a mere 15,000 years ago. Perhaps the scientific community “needed to be right?”

Fortunately for Us the People, with the age of the internet and instant, global communication the Truth is becoming harder and harder to hide.

In this century, the oldest human fossils – not gigantic, by the way – have been found in northern Africa (Jebel Irhoud, Morocco). These remains date to around 315,000 years old, as The Atlantic Daily, Nature, and other scientific publications have reported!

Archaeological discoveries keep pushing the date of human (homo sapiens sapiens, that is) origin further and further back in time.

These dates happen to jive with ancient source texts that discuss human origin, notably the Sumerian clay tablets translated by Zecharia Sitchin. This Azerbaijani-born American researcher and author upset the anthropological world with his revelation that humans had been bred by an off-world race called the Annunaki – “alien overlords” (in this case, the term actually does fit) – to serve them, especially to mine gold in the hot African sun.

Just as the Bible later described, the Annunaki – or “fallen angels” – bred with human women and birthed…a race of giants called the Nephilim. The giants had big appetites, and devoured all the crops and livestock before turning to humans as their next food source. At this point, the Annunaki admitted that the Nephilim had gotten out of hand, and flooded the earth as a global Mulligan (“do-over”) – kind of like shaking an Etch-a-Sketch upside down in order to “clean the slate.”

Now, this is where the conspiracy about giants gets interesting. Sitchin’s work continues to be refuted by “experts,” even as more archaeological evidence of beings with elongated skulls, giants and ancient African gold mines inhabited by early humans continues to pile up.

Is the New World Order actually threatened by a citizenry that is fully aware of our alien-hybridized human origin?

If people, collectively, understood that we were created to serve ETs (termed “gods” in ancient texts), how would that change our society and others around the world?

Ignoring the Illuminati agenda, alternative news sources continue to report similar “gigantic” findings from around the world. To cite just a couple: “Nephilim Bones and Giant Human Skeletons in Greece” and “Skeletons of 5,000-year-old Chinese ‘giants’ discovered by archaeologists.”

31,478,"The start of the northern meteorological winter on December 1 will bring with it short days of darkness, blistering cold and frigid blizzards. For many people, this is the dreariest time of the year. But for a small niche of water-happy athletes, winter is a time to play, as ferocious storms send rippling rings of energy outward through the ocean. By the time they reach distant shores, these swells have matured into clean, polished waves that barrel in with a cold and ceaseless military rhythm; they touch bottom, slow, build and, finally, collapse in spectacular curls and thundering white water. These are the things of dreams for surfers, many of whom travel the planet, pursuing giant breakers. And surfers aren’t the only ones with their eyes on the water—for surfing has become a popular spectator sport. At many famed breaks, bluffs on the shore provide fans with thrilling views of the action. The waves alone are awesome—so powerful they may seem to shake the earth. But when a tiny human figure on a board as flimsy as a matchstick appears on the face of that incoming giant, zigzagging forward as the wave curls overhead and threatens to crush him, spines tingle, hands come together in prayer, and jaws drop. Whether you like the water or not, big-wave surfing is one of the most thrilling shows on the planet.

The birth of big-wave surfing was an incremental process that began in the 1930s and ’40s in Hawaii, especially along the north-facing shores of the islands. Here, 15-foot waves were once considered giants, and anything much bigger just eye candy. But wave at a time, surfers stoked up their courage and ambition. They surfed on bigger days, used lighter and lighter boards that allowed swifter paddling and hunted for breaks that consistently produced monsters. One by one, big-wave spots were cataloged, named and ranked, and wave at a time, records were set. In November 1957, big-wave pioneer Greg Noll rode an estimated 25-footer in Waimea Bay, Oahu. In 1969, Noll surfed what was probably a 30-plus-footer, but no verified photos exist of the wave, and thus no means of determining its height. Fast-forwarding a few decades, Mike Parsons caught a 66-foot breaker in 2001 at Cortes Bank, 115 miles off San Diego, where a seamount rises to within three feet of the surface. In 2008, Parsons was back at the same place and caught a 77-footer. But Garrett McNamara outdid Parsons and set the current record in November 2011, when he rode a 78-foot wave off the coast of Portugal, at the town of Nazare.

But these later records may not have been possible without the assistance of jet skis, which have become a common and controversial element in the pursuit of giant waves. The vehicles first began appearing in the surf during big-wave events in the early 1990s, and for all their noise and stench, their appeal was undeniable: Jet skis made it possible to access waves 40 feet and bigger, and whose scale had previously been too grand for most unassisted surfers to reach by paddling. Though tow-in surfing has given a boost to the record books, it has also heightened the danger of surfing, and many surfers have died in big waves they might never have attempted without jet-ski assistance. Not surprisingly, many surfers have rejected tow-in surfing as an affront to the purity of their relationship with waves—and they still manage to catch monsters. In March 2011, Shane Dorian rode a 57-foot breaker at the famed Jaws break in Maui, unassisted by a belching two-stroke engine. But many big-wave riders fully endorse tow-in surfing as a natural evolution of the sport. Surfing supertstar Laird Hamilton has even blown off purists who continue to paddle after big waves without jet skis as “moving backward.” Anyway, in a sport that relies heavily on satellite imagery, Internet swell forecasts and red-eye flights to Honolulu, are we really complaining about a little high-tech assistance?

For those wishing merely to watch big waves and the competitors that gather to ride them, all that is needed is a picnic blanket and binoculars—and perhaps some help from this swell forecast website. Following are some superb sites to watch surfers catch the biggest breakers in the world this winter.

Waimea Bay, North Shore of Oahu. Big-wave surfing was born here, largely fueled by the fearless vision of Greg Noll in the 1950s. The definition of “big” for extreme surfers has grown since the early days, yet Waimea still holds its own. Fifty-foot waves can occur here—events that chase all but the best wave riders from the water. When conditions allow, elite surfers participate in the recurring Quicksilver Eddie Aikau Invitational. Spectators teem on the shore during big-swell periods, and while surfers may fight for their ride, you may have to fight for your view. Get there early.

Jaws, North Shore of Maui. Also known as Peahi, Jaws produces some of the most feared and attractive waves on earth. The break—where 50-footers and bigger appear almost every year—is almost strictly a tow-in site, but rebel paddle-by-hand surfers do business here, too. Twenty-one pros have been invited to convene at Jaws this winter for a paddle-in competition sometime between December 7 and March 15. Spectators are afforded a great view of the action on a high nearby bluff. But go early, as hundreds will be in line for the best viewing points. Also, bring binoculars, as the breakers crash almost a mile offshore.

Mavericks, Half Moon Bay, California. Mavericks gained its reputation in the 1980s and ’90s, during the revival of big-wave surfing, which lost some popularity in the 1970s. Named for a German Shepherd named Maverick who took a surgy swim here in 1961, the site (which gained an “s” but never an official apostrophe) generates some of the biggest surfable waves in the world. Today, surfing competitions, like the Mavericks Big Wave Contest and the Mavericks Invitational, are held each year. The waves of Mavericks crash on a vicious reef, making them predictable (sandy bottoms will shift and change the wave form) but nonetheless hazardous. One of the best surfers of his time, Mark Foo died here in 1994 when his ankle leash is believed to have snagged on the bottom. Later, the waves claimed the life of Hawaiian surfing star Sion Milosky. A high bluff above the beach offers a view of the action. As at Jaws, bring binoculars.

Ghost Trees, Monterey Peninsula, California. This break hits peak form under the same swell conditions that get things roaring at Mavericks, just a three-hour drive north. Ghost Trees is a relatively new attraction for big-wave riders. Veteran surfer Don Curry says he first saw it surfed in 1974. Decades would pass before it became famous, and before it killed pro surfer (and a pioneer of nearby Mavericks) Peter Davi in 2007. For surfing spectators, there are few places quite like Ghost Trees. The waves, which can hit 50 feet and more, break just a football field’s length from shore.

Mullaghmore Head, Ireland. Far from the classic Pacific shores of big-wave legend and history, Mullaghmore Head comes alive during winter storms in the North Atlantic. The location produces waves big enough that surfing here has become primarily a jet ski-assisted game. In fact, the event period for the Billabong Tow-In Session at Mullaghmore began on November 1 and will run through February 2013. Just how big is Mullaghmore Head? On March 8, 2012, the waves here reached 50 feet, as determined by satellite measurements. A grassy headland provides an elevated platform from which to see the show. Bundle up if you go, and expect cold, blustery conditions.

Teahupoo, Tahiti. This coveted break blooms with big swells from the Southern Ocean—usually during the southern winter. Teahupoo is famed for its classic tube breakers.

Shipsterns Bluff, Tasmania. Watch for this point’s giants to break from June through September.

Punta de Lobos, Chile. Channeling the energy of the Southern Ocean into huge but glassy curlers, Punta de Lobos breaks at its best in March and April.

Todos Santos Island, Baja California, Mexico. Todos Santos Island features several well-known breaks, but “Killers” is the biggest and baddest. The surf usually peaks in the northern winter.

There is another sort of wave that thrills tourists and spectators: the tidal bore. These moon-induced phenomena occur with regularity at particular locations around the world. The most spectacular to see include the tidal bores of Hangzhou Bay, China, and Araguari, Brazil—each of which has become a popular surfing event.",mainstream,M0c897,big.foot
32,1319,"What is a man like Joe doing with Bigfoot? Joe is a mexicano who knew some of the same Spanish folktales that Juan B. Rael had collected many years earlier in the area around Antonito, Colorado. I found Joe in his store of “collectables” on Main Street. His store was a little community center where people from town dropped in to talk about the news of the day. Joe is a lot like his father, Anastacio, whose boot‐making shop had also become a little community center. Joe remembers sheepherders complaining to his father that the police had stolen their money. The sheepherders came to town to collect their pay and go on a bender. They deposited most of their money with the cops who pocketed it for themselves and denied having received it. Anastacio wasn't afraid of confronting the cops. Joe's dad was a valorista , or brave man of his word who defended the weak against the strong.

Joe told me the folktales he had learned from his parents and then nudged me in a different direction. He took me to his backyard shed, pulled out a dusty box of manuscripts he had written in long hand and asked me to read them. Joe liked to read western novels by Louis L'amour and emulated that author's style. One of the manuscripts was a story about Bigfoot. I knew about his interest in the creature because he had shown us a video he and his son had taken of large footprints with an unusually long gait in the snow south of town. Joe did not see the creature that made them, and so he sought out others who had. Several had caught fleeting glimpses of something crossing Highway 285 in the cut just across the New Mexico border. A woodcutter said he found the cave where Bigfoot lives. A rancher said he came face to face with the creature in the Hansen Creek area in the San Juan Wilderness west of town. That same rancher added that many Bigfoot live in the llano between two dormant volcanoes, Mt. San Antonio south of town and Ute Mountain to the east.

At first I didn't understand why a man like Joe, who spent his life fighting for his raza would care so much about proving the existence of Bigfoot. Didn't the creature come from mass media, and weren't most enthusiasts white working class men on the wrong side of the Civil Rights struggle? Joe has stood up for the underdog his entire life. He worked as a business agent for the union presenting grievances to the Miner brothers who managed the Perlite plant south of town. Joe said: “They had my raza down in the lower paying jobs sweeping and doing the cleaning and all the hard labor. Bud Miner hated to see me coming. He told me: ‘I'm tired of you Mexicans coming over here and trying to tell us what to do.’”

There is a lot of chicanery connected with this North American wildman, and so I shied away from the subject at first. Every time we returned to Antonito, Joe told me he had found another person who had seen footprints or caught a fleeting glimpse of the creature. An Anglo showed some photographs of footprints he had taken with his cell phone camera. We held two Bigfoot parties in our Antonito home with people whose testimonies Joe considered believable. We followed them up with interviews in their homes. Joe will talk to anyone who has seen Bigfoot. It doesn't matter to him if they are Anglos or mexicanos. He knows from watching television that Bigfoot researchers are mainly Anglos.

Joe cobbled together what he learned from the witnesses to write his story, which he says is “pure fiction.” The central protagonist, Marc Gomez, is Joe's idea of a mexicano everyman who has lost touch with his ancestors. Marc is 39, just divorced from his wife, retired after 20 years in the army, and is living in Los Angeles. He loves to read western paperback novels about New Mexico and is ready for a change. He packs up his Air Stream trailer, hitches it to his Bronco, and heads toward the Land of Enchantment. Marc, like Joe himself, sets out on a quest to find Bigfoot after he dreamt of giant faceless creatures running after him on a forsaken prairie. He heads up Highway 285 and overhears, on his CB radio, a conversation between truckers one of whom says: “Some animal came out of the bar pit. I'm sure I hit it with my back wheels. Looked like a bear or something big.” Marc follows leads to an old mexicano sheepherder who lives in Velarde, New Mexico, who ran into the creature on the llano near Ute Mountain. The sheepherder has a daughter, Cristina, and she becomes Marc's lover and companion, and together they enter Bigfoot's world in the volcanic caverns under the llano. Marc and Cristina discover the creature's world is like that of humans above the llano. The strong prey on the weak in both places. Marc and Cristina show they are both valoristas by defending the weaker Bigfoot from the stronger ones who attempt to enslave them.

Each witness we interviewed had a particular take on the creature. They said he is peaceful, adapted, intelligent looking, strong, massive but graceful, and proud. Some say he is a loner, and others say he lives in families. Those with greater knowledge of the environment speak with more authority. The mexicanos I know tell and write stories about Bigfoot to claim their rightful place on a llano they share with others.",mainstream,M1306a,big.foot
0,903,"PEACE in the Middle East, according to Tami Leibovitz, may depend on Israelis learning good manners. She runs a charm school near Tel Aviv, and has a clientele of aspiring politicians, Foreign Ministry officials and former army officers, all seeking to unlearn traditional Israeli behaviour - aggressive, loud and rude.

If you think I'm being offensive, this is what she told an American audience: ""Israelis will cut in on your conversation and will often interrupt in the middle of a sentence. It is also quite common for an Israeli to complete your sentence for you. Israelis talk very loudly.""

Mrs Leibovitz, who spends her time trying to convince Israelis that being polite does not necessarily make one a weakling or a dupe, told the Guardian that the Middle East could be saved by good manners: ""We have to see that even Palestinians are human beings ... We don't know yet how to speak to other people and how to solve problems together. We have to learn that.""

Judging by the reaction of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, when he was invited to Norway to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Oslo accords this week, peace remains some way off and Mrs Leibovitz still has work to do. Netanyahu, said his spokesman, was too busy. Besides, ""there are more important things ...""

RECENTLY we learned that the true love of Simone de Beauvoir's life was the American writer Nelson Algren, with whom she carried on despite her decades-long relationship with her fellow Existentialist, Jean-Paul Sartre. He knew about Algren, apparently, and did not like the affair. But he had to put up with it, since he demanded the freedom to have amours of his own.

Reading the transatlantic correspondence reminded me of a story told by my late aunt, who lived in Paris for many years and one day found herself sitting at the next table to Sartre and de Beauvoir in a cafe.

Thrilled, my aunt leant closer to hear what two of the greatest minds in France were talking about. The subjects under discussion, it turned out, were their investments and their haemorrhoids.

1,921,"Albert Einstein stood common sense on its head when he proclaimed time to be just another dimension, like height, width and depth, and went on to declare that it can be stretched and warped like taffy. But that notion is much too mundane for Julian Barbour. According to the 64-year-old British physicist, there's no point in trying to describe time, because it simply doesn't exist. ""The passage of time,"" he says, ""is simply an illusion created by our brains.""

This unconventional theory comes from an equally unconventional man. After completing his doctorate in physics in 1968, Barbour balked at working in a university, where he would have had to teach, worry about raising grant money and persuade deans to give him tenure. Instead he started earning money by translating Russian articles into English--and did theoretical physics on the side.

The riddle of time had fascinated him all along, and about 15 years ago he tackled it in earnest. Recalls Barbour: ""I asked myself, 'How do you get hold of time? It's invisible; you can't really get your hands on it. So what is it really?'"" There wasn't any good answer. Although physicists work with time all the time (as it were), they never define precisely what it is. Barbour also knew that at least one physicist, an American named Bryce DeWitt, had managed to meld general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single consistent theory--a major goal of modern physics--by removing time from the equations. But that was generally considered a mathematical trick with no basis in reality.

Barbour thought otherwise. Every ""moment"" we experience is real, he says, but these moments exist only for that brief instant, during which time literally stands still. The passage of time is as illusory as the sense of movement created by the succession of still frames in a motion picture.

Most scientists are wary of abandoning time, but Barbour's idea is taken quite seriously by such respected physicists as Penn State's Lee Smolin and the University of Alberta's Don Page. There may even be a way to test it experimentally; a consequence of Barbour's theory is that the universe would be filled with more black holes and neutron stars than experts believe. If so, we could know within a decade whether his theory is supported by astronomical observations--and whether the ideas of time we've clung to for most of human history will go the way of the ether and the flat earth.",mainstream,M097eb,flat.earth

Scientific American, The Healthy Addiction? Coffee Study Finds More Health Benefits by David Noonan — …Tea drinkers might wonder if they are missing out on a potential health benefit and should start drinking the other stuff. “Absolutely not,” says Donald Hensrud, medical director of Mayo Clinic's Healthy Living Program. “You have to enjoy life, and if you enjoy tea, keep on enjoying it. It’s all good. There are health benefits to coffee, to black tea and to green tea.” But there can also be problems associated with higher doses of caffeine, he notes. The amount in more than two cups of coffee a day, for example, can interfere with conception and increase the risk of miscarriage. And, he says, because individuals metabolize caffeine at different rates, slow metabolizers may be more susceptible to side effects such as heartburn, insomnia, heart palpitations and irritability.

""We had three decades with no blue marble shots. Why?

""If this place was built, it was built by someone, so we're not alone.""

Steinbeck, a native Californian, studied writing intermittently at Stanford between 1920 and 1925 but never graduated. He moved to New York and worked as a manual laborer and journalist while writing his first two novels, which were not successful. He married in 1930 and moved back to California with his wife. His father, a government official in Salinas County, gave the couple a house to live in while Steinbeck continued writing.

His first novel, Tortilla Flat, about the comic antics of several rootless drifters who share a house in California, was published in 1935. The novel became a financial success.

Steinbeck’s next works, In Dubious Battle and Of Mice and Men, were both successful, and in 1938 his masterpiece The Grapes of Wrath was published. The novel, about the struggles of an Oklahoma family who lose their farm and become fruit pickers in California, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1939.

After World War II, Steinbeck’s work became more sentimental in such novels as Cannery Row and The Pearl. He also wrote several successful films, including Forgotten Village (1941) and Viva Zapata (1952). He became interested in marine biology and published a nonfiction book, The Sea of Cortez, in 1941.

5,893,"Shelter, fire, water and food: The dos and don’ts of wilderness survival

Preparedness is survival. When disaster strikes, you might find yourself stuck out in the wilderness, which can be treacherous and quite unforgiving, so knowing exactly what to do when venturing out can up your chances of making it out alive. (h/t to RealitySurvival.com)

How to survive out in the wilderness

Wilderness survival skills are an important part of any prepper’s arsenal, and will be especially useful for those who live in an urban area and have absolutely no experience with the wilderness at all. Here are a few things to take note of to keep yourself alive out in the wild.

Keep calm and use your head

When out in the wild, you should anticipate that things can go bad in no time and prepare accordingly. However, 0ne thing you should not do when out in the wilderness is panic. Panic can influence your mindset and decision-making, and can cause you to make irrational choices. Instead, you should collect yourself and start thinking of the best course of action to get you out of your current predicament.

For example, you shouldn’t waste daylight standing around feeling anxious, yet accomplishing nothing. If you want to get help, think about where the closest settlement is and start moving in the general direction before it gets dark.

Bad weather is something difficult to avoid when trying to survive out in the wilderness. In this case, knowledge on building a shelter is vital to protect yourself from exposure to the harmful elements. Getting wet even in mild temperatures can be a death sentence if you aren’t prepared.

Your shelter will depend on the resources available around you. Build your shelter as small as possible to be inconspicuous to the other denizens of the wilderness. An example shelter is to use branches and leaves and arrange them against a sturdy structure as a makeshift “roof.”

In any survival situation, finding water should be one of your priorities. An average person can survive about three days without drinking water, which decreases if he’s in a hotter climate. Even a few hours of dehydration can affect physical and mental capacity.

However, you can’t just drink any water you find. Many water sources are contaminated with bacteria and other pollutants that can be harmful to health. A conventional way to purify water is by using a water filter or purifier. You can also boil the water over a fire as an alternative.

Keep a knife on you

A knife is a versatile survival tool and can be used for a variety of purposes. From making shelters, hunting for food, to starting a fire, a knife will definitely come in handy when surviving out in the wilderness. However, a simple pocket knife wouldn’t last long. There are dedicated survival knives you can choose from that are much more durable.

If you must hunker down for the night, knowing how to make a fire can make life significantly easier. Not only can fire keep you warm and prevent problems like hypothermia, you can also use it to light up your immediate surroundings and cook food.

One of the easiest ways of having a fire ready at all times is by keeping some fire starter like matches or a lighter on your person. However, do not use flammable liquids like gasoline and lighter fluid, if you want to avoid unintentionally starting a forest fire.

6,427,"Between 542 and 66 million years ago—long before the “supervolcano” became part of Yellowstone’s geologic story—the area was covered by inland seas. 

 NPS/Jim Peaco

Most of Earth’s history (from the formation of the earth 4.6 billion years ago to approximately 541 million years ago) is known as the Precambrian time. Rocks of this age are found in northern Yellowstone and in the hearts of the Teton, Beartooth, Wind River, and Gros Ventre ranges. During the Precambrian and the subsequent Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras (541 to 66 million years ago), the western United States was covered at times by oceans, sand dunes, tidal flats, and vast plains. From the end of the Mesozoic through the early Cenozoic, mountain-building processes formed the Rocky Mountains.

 During the Cenozoic era (approximately the last 66 million years of Earth’s history), widespread mountain-building, volcanism, faulting, and glaciation sculpted the Yellowstone area.

Magma (molten rock from Earth’s mantle) has been close to the surface in Yellowstone for more than 2 million years. Its heat melted rocks in the crust, creating a magma chamber of partially molten, partially solid rock. Heat from this shallow magma caused an area of the upper crust to expand and rise. The Yellowstone Plateau became a geomorphic landform shaped by episodes of volcanic activity. Stress also caused rocks overlying the magma to break, forming faults and causing earthquakes. Eventually, these faults reached the deep magma chamber. Magma oozed through these cracks, releasing pressure within the chamber and allowing trapped gases to expand rapidly. A massive volcanic eruption then occurred along vents, spewing volcanic ash and gas into the atmosphere and causing fast super-hot debris (pyroclastic) flows on the ground. As the underground magma chamber emptied, the ground above it sunk, creating the first of Yellowstone’s three calderas.

This diagram shows the general ideas behind two theories of how magma rises to the surface. Adapted with permission from Windows into the Earth by Robert Smith and Lee J. Siegel, 2000.

Based on minerals from the last major eruption, the researchers found that the changes leading up to an eruption may happen in a matter of decades rather than thousands of years in advance as previously thought.

Supervolcanoes are characterized as volcanic centers that have had eruptions that covered more than 240 cubic miles. The US has two: one in Yellowstone and another in California’s Long Valley. An eruption could emit ash that would expand over 500 miles. The eruption would likely cover the ground with as much as 4 inches of gray ash, which could be detrimental to crops growing in the Midwest. Another less worrisome concern is the 1,000 degree F molten lava that could ooze out. Gases, including sulfur dioxide, which contributes to acid rain would be spewed from the supervolcano and the global cooling issues associated with reflecting sunlight away from the Earth are also concerns.

But there are other supervolcanos in the world with sooner predictions than Yellowstone’s. Campi Flegri, a name that aptly translates as “burning fields, is in a “critical state,” according to researchers in Italy. It consists of a vast and complex network of underground chambers that formed hundreds of thousands of years ago, stretching from the outskirts of Naples to underneath the Mediterranean Sea. Though its last eruption was in 1538, it’s due for an eruption soon. It would be a minor event compared to the 72 cubic miles of molten rock it spewed in its most notorious eruption 39,000 years ago, called Campanian Ignimbrite, that likely contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals.

Fortune website article reported that if the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, it could shoot out more than 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock and ash into the air. That’s 250 cubic miles. That’s more than three times as large as the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption in Italy, which created a sulfurous cloud that floated more than 1,200 miles away to hang over Russia. That’s 2,500 times more material than Mount St. Helens expelled in 1980, killing 57 people. An eruption at Yellowstone would result in a cloud of ash more than 500 miles wide, stretching across nearly the entire western United States.

NASA has a plan to neutralize supervolcano threats however. They believe the most viable solution could be to drill up to 6 miles down into the supervolcano, and pump down water at high pressure. The circulating water would return at a temperature of around 662F, thus slowly day by day extracting heat from the volcano. And while such a project would come at an estimated cost of around $3.46 billion, it comes with an enticing catch which could convince politicians to make the investment. It would become a source of geothermal energy. But there are considerable risks, too. It could trigger the eruption it’s meant to save us from.

Historically, four types of volcanic events have taken place in Yellowstone (you may click on each one to learn more):

 1. Caldera Forming Eruptions — 2.1 and 1.3 million years ago

 2. Lava Flows — about 30 between 640,000 and 70,000 years ago

 3. Earthquakes — 1000 to 3000 yearly; last notable quake was in 1959

 4. Hydrothermal (Steam) Explosions — small explosions in the 20th century; a

 dozen or so major explosions between 14,000 and 3,000 years ago

The likelihood of an eruption in the near future is still low. However those who instigate such a project will never see it to completion, or even have an idea whether it might be successful within their lifetime. Cooling Yellowstone in this manner would happen at a rate of 3.2808399 feet a year, taking of the order of tens of thousands of years until just cold rock was left.

7,591,"While a majority of Americans are dancing in the streets over Donald J. Trump becoming their next President and “Making America Great Again,” there are those in the Environmental movement and the Scientific community, that are expressing their concerns. Some concerns are justified, while other concerns that are being voiced raise a “Red Flag.”

We have to wonder how much of these expressed concerns are paranoia from those of “left leaning” political views… those with “Junk Science” in their portfolios (CYA)… and still others with an agenda that will not hold up under the light of day.

Some environmental planners spend their careers mapping out worst-case scenarios. As of January 20, they’ve got one in the White House.

There’s a case to be made that the Trump Administration’s rollback of environmental regulation won’t be devastating; that market forces will prevail in the coming energy revolution; that the environment and public health will continue to be protected under the EPA and other agencies, and that state governments will do their part as well; and that a newly-elected President, self-branded as an astute businessman and dealmaker, will be open to the wisdom of ensuring a safe and healthy America.

But there are two fatal flaws with this argument: 1) You weren’t born yesterday; and 2) You don’t come to this page to be lied to.

The Trump Administration’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall-to-wall collection of zealots, ideologues and latter-day Robber Barons. Their collective message, both stated and implied, is that the American government’s ability to protect the environment, already besieged and underfunded, is on the brink of oblivion.

In early December, the cavalcade of aspirants and celebrities seeking an audience at Trump Tower included two high profile climate activists, former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Gore’s visit was brokered by the First Daughter-Elect, Ivanka Trump.

The Trump Administration’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall-to-wall collection of zealots, ideologues and latter-day Robber Barons.

 Upon exiting, Gore told the press gaggle that meeting with the Trumps was “extremely interesting.” Combined with Trump’s declaration to the New York Times that he had an “open mind” about climate change, the wilted spirits of environmentalists were revived. Kudos to Gore and DiCaprio for making their case, but now, let’s return to climate reality.

He’s not let them down, helping to lead a battle—against the agency he’ll be in charge of if approved—on the Clean Power Plan, the Waters of the United States definition (WOTUS). WOTUS and the Clean Water Act hold a particular irony, since the anticipated assaults on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act could make it easier to drain real, not metaphoric, swamps from coast to coast.

A day after Gore’s meeting, Trump announced the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (Pictured left/Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. In his six years on the job in Oklahoma, Pruitt has enjoyed the support of keystone local industries, including fossil fuel and poultry.

State: Next was ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who vaulted past the likes of Rudy Guiliani and Gen. David Petraeus for the Secretary of State nomination. Months away from Exxon’s mandatory 65 year-old retirement age, Tillerson was a man in search of a hobby. Tillerson has acknowledged that human-caused climate change is real, and has endorsed both a carbon tax and the Paris climate agreement. He’s an Exxon lifer, with 41 years in the employ of a corporation that’s buried its own science affirming climate change, and that still funds climate denial groups. But don’t think he’s inexperienced in government or foreign policy. Steve Coll’s must-read 2012 book “Private Empire” makes the compelling case that Exxon functions as a sovereign petro-state, leveraging diplomatic pressure in virtually every corner of the Earth.

All told, the CEO of Exxon looks to be the most progressive voice on climate change in the Trump Administration. The CEO of Exxon. As Elizabeth Kolbert, the Pulitzer-winning New Yorker writer observed, “You have to be pretty desperate – and at this point many people are – to take this as cause for optimism.”

Related: He’s no Ronald Reagan DOE: Editorial cartoonists and late-night comics love Rick Perry, who, as its potential boss, probably now remembers that Department of Energy was one of those agencies he’d like to abolish.

The former Texas governor is actually a big fan of wind power, which he watched become a booming industry in his state. “You can be proud that Texas produces more energy from wind turbines than all but five countries,” he boasted upon leaving office in 2015.

He ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking as well, and last year joined the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer Partners, the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Perry (Pictured left/Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) has also said that climate science is a conspiracy to keep climate scientists as wealthy as we all know that they are. While DOE has been home to groundbreaking clean energy research, the bulk of the department’s mission and budget goes to maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, and cleaning up the immense messes left by their manufacture.

Since leaving the Texas State House, Perry has kept himself busy with an unsuccessful appearance on “Dancing With the Stars,” and by turning back a criminal indictment for abuse of power as Governor. Step lightly, Guv.

Interior: Ryan Zinke (Pictured below/ Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) is a first-term Montana congressman who accepts that climate change is real. In the past, he’s called climate change a “threat multiplier,” but that Obama’s climate strategies would unleash “catastrophic” economic costs.

An avid hunter, Zinke says he’d like to see more intensive use of federal lands by both sportsmen and oil and gas drillers, and is expected to favor opening controversial export terminals to ship Montana and Wyoming coal across the Pacific. He does have credentials as a “hook and bullet” conservationist, including support for the crucial Land and Water Conservation Fund. That’s earned him opposition from western anti-environment groups like the American Land Rights Association.He earned a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters in 2015. Unlike many on the Trump team, he’s voiced opposition for turning federal lands over to states.

Rick Perry ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking and last year joined the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer Partners, the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Justice: If approved, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions would serve as Attorney General. He’s said that efforts to bring clean energy to developing nations would be a veritable assault on the world’s poorest people. He believes CO2 is a benign “plant food,” and famously launched a bizarre interrogation of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy earlier this year.

Enough about the energy/environment bosses. The secondary players may be considerably worse. Many of these items are taken from first-rate reporting by Lyndsey Gilpin of High Country News, and research by Jenny Rowland and Erin Auel at the Center for American Progress. The CAP researchers documented that nearly every key member of the transition teams for EPA, Interior, and DOE worked for Koch-funded organizations or office-holders.

Energy: Thomas Pyle, a former lobbyist for both Koch Industries and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, leads the transition team. He currently runs the Koch- and Exxon-funded Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that’s espoused a loosening of energy regulations and climate denial while denouncing wind energy.

A special moment came on December 14, when Energy transition team member Anthony Scaramucci appeared on CNN.

Anthony Scaramucci, a financial CEO and Fox Business News contributor, mixed it up with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in mid-December. Cuomo repeatedly asked his guest about whether climate change is real. Citing Flat Earth Theory, Scaramucci took a deep dive into the manufacture of doubt.

Funny thing: Scaramucci was asked the same question six months ago and declared climate science to be “irrefutable.” For good measure, and possibly with his new boss in mind, he added back in June, “I find it tragic that so many people in this country believe global warming is some sort of elaborate hoax perpetuated by every credible scientist on the planet.”

Other Energy Department transition officials include two more former Koch Industries lobbyists, Mike McKenna and Mike Catanzaro. Catanzaro also served a stint as Communications Director for uber-denier Sen. James Inhofe. Team member William Greene is Deputy Legislative Director for the Safari Club International, which has lobbied for trophy-hunting exemptions from the Endangered Species Act.

Transitioner Daniel Simmons comes from two Koch-funded groups, IER and ALEC.

Somewhere on this DOE team, an unidentified someone has been “counseled.” Those were the announced consequences for distributing a questionnaire to DOE employees that, among other things, sought to identify anyone at the agency who had participated in climate-related meetings.

After an uproar, and a refusal by current DOE staff to comply, the Trump team disowned the questionnaire and its McCarthy Era overtones (In fairness to Senator Joe McCarthy, he was nowhere near as forgiving with the Russians).

NASA Transition head Chris Shank is the #2 staffer to House Science Committee Chair Lamar Smith, and is expected to steer the agency away from its vital Earth science and climate change research.

Commerce: The Commerce Department’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is NASA’s government counterpart in climate research. Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross has made billions on rescuing and leveraging distressed companies, including coal, oil and gas firms. He’s acknowledged that climate change is a thing, offering suggestions to boost rail traffic and invest in ethanol as climate fixes.

Ross’s International Coal Group owned the Sago Mine in West Virginia. In January 2006, 13 miners were trapped in an explosion at the mine. Only one was rescued. In 2011, Ross sold ICG to Arch Coal for a reported $3.4 billion.

There’s little indication that NOAA’s climate science is nearly as much in the crosshairs as NASA’s. But, as one former Commerce official told me, “maybe they just haven’t gotten to it yet.”

EPA: Myron Ebell is a veteran political operative guiding EPA’s transition team. Ebell dodges the “denier” label via a few old climate-denial standards: In the past, he’s either said that climate change is “nothing to worry about,” or that it will be awesome when fewer people die from the cold in a warming world.

When hackers stole thousands of emails from climate scientists in 2009, Ebell described the climate science community as a “gang” that was “without honor.” Multiple investigations cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing.

Also on the team are attorneys David Schnare and Chris Horner of the American Tradition Institute. Schnare and Horner have specialized in filing lawsuits and sweeping Freedom of Information Act requests against prominent climate scientists. Bankruptcy filings by coal companies have revealed their funding for Schnare’s and Horner’s work.

National Security Team: K.T. McFarland, (Pictured left/Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) another Fox contributor, would become Deputy National Security Advisor. She’s denounced the Obama Administration for citing climate change as a global security issue.

Monica Crowley, still another appointee drained from Fox News, will handle the press for National Security Advisor Mike Flynn. She recently called global warming “a way of separating Americans and Westerners from God and organized religion, and it’s also a wealth redistribution scheme.”

CIA: Wichita-based Congressman Mike Pompeo counts on David and Charles Koch as his constituents. He’s been a business partner with Koch Industries through an oil supply firm, and has said that President Obama is “horribly wrong” about climate change posing a global security risk.

Interior: Doug Domenech is a former Virginia state official who blames the “regulatory war on coal” for tough times in Appalachia, and says that the miracle mineral can relieve energy poverty. But coal jobs have been on a steady swan dive since the Reagan Administration due to mechanization.

Other Interior transition staffers include attorney Daniel Jorjani, who works for the Koch’s Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. Authors Alyssa Katz describes this effort as having bankrolled anti-regulatory campaigns by the U.S. Chamber and others with $255 million in 2012 alone.

Congressional staffer Harlan Watson served as chief climate negotiator under President George W. Bush. A leaked memo from ExxonMobil, written shortly after Bush’s inauguration, sang Watson’s praises and recommended him for a role in climate policy.

And a few more: As Transportation Secretary-designate, Elaine Chao would lead on major infrastructure projects, including the Obama Administration’s plans to ramp up electric vehicle charging stations nationwide. Chao resigned her seat on the Bloomberg Philanthropies Board in 2015 when the charity decided to increase its support of the Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign. She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – a helpful reminder that sometimes, guilt by association means that you’re guilty.

Linda McMahon, nominee for the Small Business Administration, has cited “conflicting science on both sides of this issue.” The former World Wrestling Entertainment executive didn’t go so far as to declare climate science is fake and has a predetermined outcome.

Senior Counselor Steve Bannon’s Breitbart News site regularly touts climate denial. Bannon accused the Pope of “hysteria” for embracing climate action. Domestic transition head Ken Blackwell believes that climate models are rigged, and the science is a “hoax.” HUD nominee Ben Carson has said there’s “no overwhelming science” on climate change. Chief of Staff Reince Preibus said “melting icebergs aren’t beheading Christians in the Middle East.” UN Ambassador nominee Nikki Haley fought the Clean Power Plan as South Carolina Governor, even as her state endured lethal, record-smashing downpours. And Vice President-Elect Mike Pence has at times said climate change is real, but that government policy can’t impact it. But he’s also called it a “myth.”

8,948,"In 1995, a woman by the name of Nancy Lieder claimed to have had contact with extraterrestrial beings known as Zetas. She was visited by one of her “hybrid sons” and was being prepared for a role as a messenger for the Zetas (Zeta Talk). Nancy eventually quit her full time job in California and moved to Wisconsin to pursue her new appointed position as messenger for the Zetas (Zeta Talk). Official information from the Zetas can be found online at Zeta Talk. Since 1995, the Zetas have been revealing to Nancy plans they have for the human race as well as predictions of future events and catastrophes. In the early 2000s, Nancy made a wrong prediction of an event occurring and lost a large number of followers, yet a close knit following still remains. The belief is extraordinary because the only evidence is word of mouth.

Nancy Lieder is the only contact with the Zetas. She proclaims many elaborate facts of realities not yet known to mankind and is quite thorough in their descriptions. So far, Nancy has been unable to accurately make predictions of future events stating that the Zetas can be wrong sometimes (Zeta Talk). Nancy also does not have any physical evidence of the existence of Zetas, but in a video she posted on YouTube, she describes a scene she experienced with a Zeta in such great detail that it would be surprising if it were not real. But, again, the impressive detail and other anecdotal visions is the only evidence of Zeta existence.

In the eyes of those invested in the belief, Nancy Lieder has asserted herself in a position of high credibility and authority through the telling’s complex rules to live by, predictions of catastrophes, and enlightened happenings of the “aftertime” where alien-kind and humankind openly walk amongst each other. Nancy, as the contact, uses modern events like global warming as verification of the Zeta’s predictions, which her followers believe. Those who are devout in their belief are misinterpreting real evidence of earthly phenomena as doings of the Zetas.

There is a consistent community of Zeta believers on social media, and those that participate in the community are actively adopting this belief more and more into their self concepts. In other words, the belief is taking up residents in their personal identity, which means that being a part of the group who is becoming who they are. When multiple people commune with each other in this way, a bond is formed amongst the group and it becomes larger than they are as individuals.

One of the most prominent aspects of Nancy’s messages is the “aftertime” and what life after death will look like. According to Terror Management Theory, people will pursue meaningful experiences as well as beliefs that buffer against the fear of the inevitability of death. Since Zeta’s messages expand into description of life after death, many people find refuge in the belief that people will one day live amongst aliens.

9,941,"In a ""show of force,"" the U.S. Navy dispatched an aircraft carrier and five escort ships to the South China Sea amid rising tensions between the U.S., China and other Southeast Asian nations claiming territory in the disputed region, multiple defense officials confirmed to Fox News Friday.

The dispatch sends a signal to China that the U.S. Navy will continue to conduct freedom of navigation patrols even as China continues to ""militarize"" islands, those officials say.

The Navy Times reported Thursday the U.S. sent the USS John C. Stennis, two destroyers, two cruisers and the 7th Fleet flagship. The deployment comes after Defense Secretary Ash Carter warned China over the militarization of its claimed artificial islands.

The Stennis was joined by the Japan-based cruisers Antietam and Mobile Bay and destroyers Chung-Hoon and Stockdale, according to the Navy Times. The command ship USS Blue Ridge, is also in the area and is heading for the Philippines. Officials said the Antietam was conducting a separate patrol from the Stennis.

Tensions have increased over the last month after it was learned that China had placed surface-to-air-missiles on one of the Paracel Islands. Since the incident, U.S. Pacific Command Chief Adm. Harry Harris has sea that China is militarizing the region.

“In my opinion China is clearly militarizing the South China Sea,” Harris testified on Feb. 24. “You’d have to believe in a flat Earth to believe otherwise.”

The U.S. has completed patrols within the 12-mile limit of China’s artificial islands. Last October, the destroyer Lassen went through the region and on Jan. 30, the destroyer Curtis Wilbur sailed near Trinton Island, part of the Paracel Islands.

Carter took a harsh tone Tuesday speaking at a conference in San Francisco. He said if China doesn’t heed the warning to stop militarizing the region, the U.S. was prepared to increase military deployments to the Asia-Pacific region and would spend nearly $425 million to pay for more joint military exercise with countries that feel threatened by Beijing.

“China must not pursue militarization in the South China Sea,” China said in a speech in San Francisco. “Specific actions will have specific consequences.”

Meanwhile, a Philippine official said he spotted five Chinese coast guard and navy ships at the Jackson Atoll last week that have not been previously stationed there before. However, by Wednesday the ships were gone.

China also announced Friday it will boost defense spending 7 to 8 percent in 2016, its smallest increase in six years. However, it will still have the world’s largest standing military in the world.

The U.S. and other Southeast Asian governments with rival claims, have expressed alarm over China's island construction, saying it raises tensions, threatens regional stability and could violate freedom of navigation and overflight.

Aside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have conflicting territorial claims in the Spratlys.

10,43,"Justin Bieber released a new single called Yummy and it seems to be custom made to piss people off. For starters, the song’s brain-numbing hook is somewhat infuriating in its own right. It’s like it was written for toddlers.

However, the verses make it clear that the actual subject of the song is very adult and very sexual.

Here’s an example of suggestive lyrics:

While Bieber is clearly not the first artist to release a pop song with sexual innuendo, the promotion surrounding the single makes things extremely weird and uncomfortable. Whoever handler’s Bieber’s Instagram account decided it would be a good idea to post pictures of random babies with the hashtag “Yummy”.

Here are some examples.

Bieber’s IG account contains many more pictures of babies. To make things even weirder, Bieber also posted the song’s title with pizza letters.

It is now a widely known fact that “pizza” is a code word used in pedophile circles. It even became a meme in internet forums such as 4Chan. To those who understand the sick codes of these people, the combination of the song’s lyrics with pictures of babies and the word “Yummy” written in pizza letters is difficult to ignore.

Another widely known meme associated with these creeps is pedobear. Here’s another post on Bieber’s IG account in the midst of the Yummy promotional blitz.

To make things even stranger, the music video adds another layer of “what in hell?”

The music video takes place in a posh restaurant that is attended by posh-looking people. It’s the type of place people in the elite would go to.

At the beginning of the video, the camera lingers on children playing music.

While the children are playing, Bieber enjoys weird food with some weird-looking people.

Considering the subject matter of the song, one can easily interpret that this orgy of food is actually meant to represent an orgy of people. The close-ups of people suggestively eating food are not very subtle.

The final frame of the video explains what the food in the video actually represents. That frame is so symbolically important that it was also posted on Bieber’s Instagram account.

The final frame basically says that the dishes represent children. They are being “tasted”. And Bieber is a victim of the very system he is celebrating in the video.

What is Happening With Bieber?

Some might wonder why Bieber is partaking in this is creepy and overt child-loving stuff while he could, like, not do it. The short answer is: He doesn’t have a choice. Since the very beginning of his career, Bieber was always an industry pawn, with little or no control over his career. As the last frame of Yummy appears to say, Bieber himself might have been abused by creeps in the music industry.

Others wonder why Bieber – who is a devout and outspoken Christian – is partaking in this occult elite stuff. Indeed, there are lots of Jesus-related posts on his IG account (although weirdly mixed with creepy, Yummy-related pictures). However, to get a better picture of what is happening here, we need to look at Bieber’s church: The powerful, star-studded Hillsong Church.

The Church is famously attended by various stars such as Selena Gomez, Kylie and Kendall Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Nick Jonas, Hailee Steinfeld, and Bono. All of them are pawns of the occult elite.

The founder of the church Brian Houston also has close ties with the political elite of Australia.

All of this elite endorsement happened despite the fact that the Church has a dark secret: The father of the Church’s founder Frank Houston admitted to abusing several young boys in Australia and New Zealand. And the leadership of the Church did everything possible to cover-up this sordid affair.

Frank Houston, the father of Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston, was a pastor in New Zealand and Australia who abused as many as nine boys over the course of his ministry. In the 1960s and ’70s, one victim was routinely subjected to sexual abuse from the age of 7 to 12. In 1999, his mother reported the abuse to the church. Although Brian Houston was legally obligated to report the crime, he did not do so. The victim later testified to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that Frank Houston offered him AU$10,000 as compensation at a McDonald’s in the presence of Hillsong Church elder Nabi Saleh. During an internal church investigation, Frank Houston eventually confessed to the crime. The commission also heard that he was involved in the sexual abuse of other children in New Zealand. Frank Houston resigned from his church in 2000, which then merged with Hillsong Church. Contrary to what is stated in Frank Houston’s resignation letter, he retired from the position of senior pastor of Sydney Christian Life Centre in May 1999 and was never employed by Hillsong Church. A further internal investigation by Assemblies of God in Australia, in conjunction with the Assemblies of God in New Zealand, found six additional child sexual abuse allegations, which were regarded as credible. In 2015, the royal commission examined allegations that accused Brian Houston of concealing his father’s crimes and censured him for failing to report his father to the police. In November 2018, 60 Minutes aired a segment revisiting the sexual abuse scandal, because newly revealed documentation allegedly reveals that Brian Houston was deeply involved in a cover-up and that Frank Houston’s abusive behaviour was worse than initially thought. Brian Houston allegedly used his position within the Assemblies of God in Australia denomination to conceal his father’s serial child sexual abuse. The matter was referred to the New South Wales Police Force, which confirmed that Brian Houston was under criminal investigation for failing to report a serious crime. Following the 60 Minutes story, Hillsong released a statement in response to the allegations.

 – Ibid.

So, to circle back to the title of the article: Why did Justin Bieber tag babies “Yummy” on Instagram? Because he is a pawn of the entertainment industry which is controlled by some very sick people.

Since the beginning of his career, Bieber has been caught up in a never-ending whirlwind of strange, humiliating events and has often displayed bizarre behavior. He’s always been a “whipping boy” of the industry and the face of crappy pop music. With Yummy, the pattern continues. His handlers purposely turned Yummy into some kind of “child-lover” anthem by associating it with overt imagery and creepy Instagram posts.

In short, Bieber was used to push one of the elite’s favorite agendas: The normalization and the celebration of child abuse.

12,1248,"Editor's note: ""Glenn Beck"" is on Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET.

NEW YORK (CNN) -- We all want to live in a world that's clean, healthy and prosperous.

We all want to hand that world off to our children in slightly better shape than we received it. No one, even the supposedly evil oil executive, has any reason to want anything different. But, for some reason, we find ourselves searching for villains. Surely they exist, but the endless quest to create them sometimes overwhelms our better judgment, whether intentional or not.

Congress has picked ""Big Oil"" as their enemy of the week. These companies inexplicably put profits above people, ravaging the environment and financially assaulting the poor to put another couple of dollars on their balance sheet. That's the storyline we've all been taught.

Yes, times are tough for many. Sure, oil companies make a lot of cash. But, for that money, they get us to work, get ambulances to the hospital, keep our homes warm, and employ thousands of our friends and neighbors while financing their retirement, paying their health care, and providing energy to millions. Because of capitalism, they have the incentive to do that. I've yet to see what our government does for us with their rather large chunk of each gallon of gas we buy, and I've yet to see them offer to return it or suggest a gas-tax-windfall-tax-tax.

The other villain of the moment is the global warming ""denier."" Anyone who disagrees, even in the slightest, must be ridiculed. On ""60 Minutes"" last weekend, Al Gore said: ""They're almost like the ones who still believe that the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona and those who believe the Earth is flat. That demeans them a little bit, but it's not that far off.""

Approximately 6 percent of Americans believe in the fake moon landing theory, although I've always heard there was a conspiratorial consensus that it was staged in Nevada, not Arizona. I'm going to guess quite a bit less than 6 percent believe in a flat Earth, but no one seems to be asking that question in polls anymore, so I can't be sure. So, who are those people Gore was demeaning ""a little bit"" by these comparisons? There's a good chance it's you. That's because the vast majority of Americans believe something that categorizes them as a flat earther to environmentalists like Gore.

Despite the media's one-sided view (the Business and Media Institute says dissenting voices about global warming are outnumbered on CBS News broadcasts by a 38 to 1 ratio), only 21 percent of Americans say ""the release of greenhouse gasses is the most important factor causing global warming"" according to a 2007 New York Times/CBS News poll.

The ""60 Minutes"" piece wasn't just filled with misrepresentations of opinion; it had plenty of Gore-style hypocrisy. He was embroiled in controversy when it was revealed his mansion used 20 times more energy than the average American. His explanation? ""Since then"" his house has been retrofitted with solar panels. I'm sure Eliot Spitzer hasn't been renting many women since he was caught either. (Although I'm not betting my life on it.)

We then see footage of Gore's parents' farm that will, sometime in the future, be run on wind power. Apparently, the windmill store has been out of stock for the past 20 years.

Perhaps most comically, Gore is seen dragging an entire film crew on a jet to India to give a climate presentation to about 100 people. Gore claimed: ""We just don't have any choice. I wish I knew a better way to do it. I constantly ask myself, 'How can I be more effective in getting this message across?' "" The most effective thing you can think of is flying halfway across the world to speak with 100 people? Maybe you had other things to do while you were there, but I'd be surprised if there was anything essential that couldn't be accomplished with a telephone and a computer. The people in India will be able to see your fancy graphs on their screens, and you'll cut demand for those evil overseas flights.

The entire ""60 Minutes"" piece felt like a commercial for Gore's upcoming commercials. He's spending $300 million in advertising to convince people of something he claims there is already a consensus on. To put that much money into perspective; it's more than Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. John Edwards, Sen. John McCain, former Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rep. Ron Paul raised in all of last year combined. Think of it as going green by getting lots of green.

Where is all that money coming from? Gore says he's donating his profits from ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" and his Nobel Peace Prize cash award. Let's be generous and say there's only $290 million left to explain. Apparently, a follow-up question to find the origins of this nine-figure sum would have involved six seconds that ""60 Minutes"" wasn't willing to commit.

What is there to learn from all of this? Whether it's politicians on both sides of the aisle or our vaunted environmental superheroes, the quest for power overwhelms even the slightest instinct of self-examination.

In the end, the timing of the Gore interview airing couldn't have been better. It fell on the same weekend as the first ""Earth Hour,"" when the world supposedly came together to turn our attention to climate change by shutting the lights off for an hour. The imagery of monuments like the Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois, going dark was plastered over newscasts everywhere.

But those pictures highlighted the global warming movement and the congressional attacks on energy companies in an entirely unintended way.

Behind the darkened Sears Tower was the city of Chicago, with lights shining brightly as far as the eye could see. For one hour the Sears Tower knew what it was like to be Al Gore: A larger than life symbol, blocking our view of reality.

13,712,"As the consequences of light pollution have become more visible, lighting regulations have started to evolve. Canada passed bird-friendly lighting (and construction) laws in the mid-1990s, and now numerous cities—including Toronto, Washington, D.C., and New York—participate in lights-out campaigns during peak migration seasons. And in 2016, the American Medical Association responded to the growing body of evidence suggesting that intense LEDs are harmful to human health by recommending that communities change streetlights to “minimize and control blue-rich environmental lighting.”

Entire cities are even re-doing their lights in an attempt to reclaim the night and decrease energy waste. Flagstaff, Arizona, was the first city to be designated a Dark Sky Community by the International Dark-Sky Association, and Chicago is in the process of retrofitting its fixtures.

So far, hesitations about dimmer, sparser lighting causing an uptick in crime or decreased safety at night have not been supported by the data; in Chicago’s West Garfield Park, more brightly lit alleys actually led to an increase in reported crime. And anecdotally, people are finding that less glaring lighting makes it easier to see in unlit areas, because our eyes adapt more quickly to the dark.

For some cities, eliminating light pollution is also a way to increase tourism revenue while strengthening humanity’s connection to the night sky. Consider the town of Jasper, Alberta. Nestled in the remote Canadian Rockies, Jasper is a haven for those who love the mountains, wildlife, and the outdoors. Just a few minutes drive outside town, stargazers can see a dazzling array of nighttime wonders, from oft-hidden stars and satellites to meteorites and the aurora borealis.

Since 2010, the city has hosted a Dark Sky Festival in the fall that brings in thousands of people. But Jasper residents aren’t content to have the nighttime wonders visible only just beyond their borders. The town is now working with Lumican, a Canadian company that partners with the International Dark-Sky Association, to re-do all its streetlights. Slated to start this summer, the town’s roughly 400 fixtures will be replaced with shielded Lumican LEDs set to color temperatures ranging between 1,700 and 2,200 Kelvin, which efficiently cast an amber glow while limiting more harmful blue wavelengths.

“What caught our attention at first was how horrible all these new LED street lights looked; so glary, prison-like, and overly bright,” says Lumican’s Lara Mitchell. When she realized that such street lighting erases stars and damages ecosystems, the company turned toward fighting light pollution.

Throughout North America and Europe, dark sky parks are on the rise, and festivals like Jasper’s are flourishing. People are beginning to reconnect with the sparkling canvas that swirls overhead just as technologies are becoming available on scales that will help humanity reclaim more of this natural nighttime majesty—if we choose to use them.

Christopher Kyba, the scientist who studies light pollution on a global level, points to van Gogh’s “Cafe Terrace at Night” as his image of an ideal nighttime scene.

“This is the dream of what you want to have—nice, warm, uniform lighting. You can see lots of stars up above, the facades are unlit,” he says. “You look a hundred-something years in the past to see the idealized lighting.”",mainstream,M0c4ec,flat.earth
14,123,"12 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.

3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.

6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.

7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.

9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.

11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.

13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.

16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

15,462,"On Reddit, some “Game of Thrones” fans subscribe to a tortuous theory that a group of old, scholarly men — the maesters — are part of a sprawling and hidden conspiracy to exert control over the show’s mythical kingdom. They write thousands of words to each other proving that every obscure clue adds up to a big picture that only they can see.

Just a few clicks away, other Reddit users are sure that a secretive group — the Illuminati — is part of a sprawling and hidden conspiracy to control the real world. They do exactly the same thing.

There are some clear parallels between fan conspiracy theories and political conspiracy theories. They were once confined to the far corners of American culture, but in recent years have flourished thanks in part to internet message boards and social media, which offer anyone the opportunity to publish, debunk, rebunk and remix their own imaginary concepts and share them with like-minded theorists.

The theories, however, share more than just message boards. The psychology of groups and the internet’s propensity to amplify outlandish content and reward the people who create it has created the kind of feedback loops in which bizarre theories — from both fantasy fans and the politically paranoid — flourish.

Russell Zimmerman, 41, a writer, game developer and military historian, loves to theorize about “Game of Thrones,” particularly the books on which it is based, George R.R. Martin’s series, “A Song of Ice and Fire.” But some theories are even too much for him, such as one that argues one character (Varys, the spymaster) is secretly a sea creature.

“To me, that's about the level of ‘out there’ crazy-talk as assuming there's a kiddie porn ring in the basement of a pizza shop without a basement,” he said, referring to the “pizzagate” conspiracy theory that remains popular on the fringes of the far right.

“Thrones” is not the only show with a strong internet following and crackpot theories.

The popular Adult Swim show “Rick and Morty” has various fan guesses at the show’s secrets. BBC’s “Doctor Who,” which follows a time-traveling human-looking alien exploring the universe, has its own theories. And in the early days of the consumer internet, “The X-Files,” a show that often touched on real-life conspiracy theories, gave birth to some of the first online fan theories.

Meanwhile, any number of real-world conspiracy theories have taken hold among various political and social groups on the internet.

Joseph Uscinski, associate professor of political science at the University of Miami and author of “Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them,” said diehard fans and conspiracy theorists share a love of extrapolating from the facts in their possession.

“Conspiracy theories are similar to fan fiction in that they both allow people to make up whatever they want,” he said.

Uscinski said that whether it’s “Game of Thrones,” “Star Wars” or the JFK assassination, people can take a plot or an event and “go to wherever they want with it.”

As an example, Uscinski cited Qanon, a remarkably popular genre of conspiracy theories that generally center on a mysterious figure who claims that President Donald Trump is working to uncover a powerful group of pedophiles.

“You have this anonymous poster, Q, who puts out nonsensical clues and people try to make sense of it and try to figure out what happens next,” he said. “They are enjoying this. They like piecing these things together. It’s a fan thing for them.”

Brendon Boutin, 32, who runs a popular “Game of Thrones” recap channel, “Man of Recaps,” said the excitement generated by both kinds of theories drove their popularity.

“I think the biggest similarity is the feeling you get, the rush of hunting for the truth and discovering secret knowledge,” Boutin said by email. “I watched some 9/11 ‘Truth’ videos back in the day, and those brought about the same thrill as discovering Jon Snow's parentage.”

“Game of Thrones” is far from the only show to have a fervent fanbase that has created its own theories, but few have created a community as rich and active, both online and off. Laurel Steinberg, a New York-based relationship therapist, said the behavior shown by conspiracy theorists and superfans is “absolutely analogous.”

“People like to feel part of a group, part of a movement, part of a team,” Steinberg said. “It feels good to have something that gives them a identity. It feels good to have something to be excited about, and watch develop in real time.”

But “Thrones” fandom is also susceptible to the same internet dynamics that have spurred ever-more outlandish conspiracy theories, rewarding people who can draw the most attention.

“You're able to create community, and then become an expert. You’ve ridden the tailcoats of the star and then you become a breakout star in that community,” Steinberg said.”You become an influencer.”

Chloe Ketchum, 27, who co-hosts a podcast about the series, “Girls Gone Canon,” said that while she enjoys the feeling of community around “Game of Thrones,” she’s also seen the lengths some fans will go to attract a following.

“There are creators that push shock value to get views,” Ketchum said. “People will do anything for attention.”

While there are similarities in the psychology behind intense fandoms and political conspiracists, Uscinski stressed that they result in divergent behaviors. He said fans will generally abandon theories that don’t hold up, whereas conspiracy theorists ignore evidence that proves them wrong.

There’s also the real-world consequences. Conspiracy theories around politics and current events have inspired some people to commit acts of violence, which has led to efforts by politicians and activist groups to force internet platforms to reign in the spread of the disinformation that can fuel the theories.

“When the show comes out, people will disregard their theories that didn’t turn out to be true,” he said. “But with flat earthers, when they do an experiment and it doesn’t show them what they want, they still hold that belief anyway. They’re much more invested”",mainstream,M0dbd4,flat.earth; illuminati

17,737,"Taiwan president-elect TsaiIng-wen must ""prove"" her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is not pro-independence before Beijing will deal with her, a senior member of China's largely rubber stamp parliament said on Thursday.

China considers self-ruled Taiwan a wayward province, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after the Chinese civil war.

Beijing has repeatedly warned against any moves towards independence since January's landslide win by Tsai and her DPP in presidential and parliamentary elections. Tsai assumes office in May.

While the DPP's charter calls for the island's formal independence, senior DPP leaders have not publicly stated that clause of late and Tsai has said she wishes to have peace with China and to maintain the status quo.

Speaking on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary session, Wang Yifu, who leads the Chinese-appointed Taiwan delegation to parliament, said the DPP's independence platform ""makes the world feel uneasy"".

Wang had been asked by a reporter to comment on Tsai's pledge to develop bilateral relations under the framework of Taiwan's constitution which stipulates that Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are part of ""one China"".

Tsai's pledge ""contradicts"" the independence clause in the DPP's own charter, Wang said, adding that she and the DPP would have to ""prove (the DPP) is not a Taiwan independence party"".

""This is the basis for cross-Strait exchanges,"" said Wang, who is also president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots - a Chinese government group composed of Taiwanese exiles, defectors and their descendants.

The DPP did not respond to a request for comment.

China appoints a Taiwan delegation to parliament every year to back up its sovereignty claims over the island, even though nobody in proudly democratic Taiwan votes for them.

Wang stopped short of spelling out whether China wants the DPP to drop, revise or freeze the independence clause in its charter.

Wang urged DPP leaders to ""appreciate and reciprocate the mainland's goodwill"".

Chinese President Xi Jinping said last week China would never allow the historical tragedy of Taiwan being ""split"" off from the rest of the country to happen again, warning the island against any moves towards formal independence.

18,532,"Hillary Clinton’s abrupt departure from a Sept. 11 ceremony in New York after falling ill Sunday and the subsequent disclosure that she is suffering from pneumonia are likely to intensify scrutiny on the Democratic nominee’s health and potentially inject a new campaign issue into a race between two of the oldest candidates ever to seek the White House.

Clinton supporters had long dismissed concerns about her health as baseless, insisting that she only suffered from allergies. But Sunday’s incident — along with a video appearing to show Clinton having difficulty standing on her own — will only amplify such questions just as the race enters its final weeks.

The incident also could increase pressure on Clinton, 68, and Republican nominee Donald Trump, 70, to release more information about their health. Clinton has disclosed less than some previous candidates. Donald Trump has released almost nothing.

“This is the kind of thing that voters have a right to understand before they cast a vote,” said Katie Packer, a GOP strategist who says she does not support either Trump or Clinton.

“Both Trump and Hillary are elderly. They are obligated to release full medical records and full tax returns to the American people. And the media, party leaders and American people should settle for nothing less.”

The pneumonia diagnosis comes as the campaign enters its most grueling phase, weeks before the first presidential debate and as voters start heading to the polls in states with early voting. Her doctor, who made the diagnosis Friday, has advised Clinton to curtail her schedule. But the Democratic candidate did not appear to skip any planned events over the weekend, including a fundraiser in New York headlined by Barbra Streisand.

After the incident, Clinton’s campaign said late Sunday it was canceling a planned trip to California on Monday and Tuesday for fundraisers and a taping of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”

Clinton’s lung infection comes after a tough week for her campaign, with polls showing a tightening of the race against Trump. Then over the weekend, Clinton was forced to partially walk back comments she made referring to half of Trump’s supporters as “deplorables.”

The new scrutiny of her health will add to these problems.

“Forty-eight hours ago, this was something for the Flat Earth Society and the birth certificate deniers,” Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said of the speculation about Clinton’s health. “Now it’s a topic of legitimate, mainstream political discussion.”

Although Clinton’s opponents will surely make an issue of her having pneumonia, her campaign’s relatively quick release of the diagnosis marked a significant step toward transparency for a candidate who has often shied away from disclosing information she considers private.

But some critics complained that Clinton did not reveal the potentially debilitating condition Friday when it was diagnosed. And after she fell ill Sunday morning, her campaign initially attributed it to “overheating” and waited nearly seven hours — as rumors and speculation about her health swirled — until disclosing the pneumonia.

For Clinton, perhaps the most damaging part of the day was the 19-second video of her struggling to leave the event in New York City. The video, quickly circulated online and replayed on cable news channels, shows her standing uneasily, her knees appearing to buckle and needing help to get into her van.

A spokesman said immediately afterward that Clinton left the ceremony at the site of the World Trade Center about 9:30 a.m. because she felt unwell. Reporters who were traveling with Clinton were not told about her condition or her whereabouts for 90 minutes after she left the ceremony.

“Secretary Clinton attended the Sept. 11th commemoration ceremony for just an hour and 30 minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen,” spokesman Nick Merrill said in the initial statement released by the campaign. “During the ceremony, she felt overheated so departed to go to her daughter’s apartment, and is feeling much better.”

The weather was in the low 80s and humid.

Clinton spent about two hours at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment and emerged shortly before noon wearing sunglasses, greeting a young girl and waved at diners at a nearby restaurant.

“I’m feeling great. It’s a beautiful day in New York,” Clinton said before heading to her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.

Her personal physician examined her at her house Sunday afternoon and said Clinton was recovering.

“While at this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely,” said Dr. Lisa R. Bardack in a statement. Bardack said Clinton was put on antibiotics Friday.

Clinton’s health has long been the speculation of conspiracy theorists. In 2014, a People magazine cover of Clinton in her backyard leaning on a chair prompted speculation that she was leaning on a walker.

But innuendo about her health grew markedly during the presidential campaign as Trump and his surrogates, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, routinely questioned her strength and stamina on the campaign trail.

Trump was uncharacteristically silent Sunday after news of Clinton’s illness emerged.

Republicans have also pointed to coughing fits that Clinton has suffered while campaigning, and which she attributes to seasonal allergies. Her opponents have also raised questions about the effect of a concussion she sustained in 2012.

The drumbeat got to the point that Clinton poked fun at it on late-night television. During an August appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” she pretended to exert great effort as she opened a jar of pickles and asked the host to check her pulse.

Clinton dismissed the attacks as “wacky” and noted that critics have claimed “I would be dead in six months,” she said. “So with every breath I take I feel like I have a new lease on life.”

19,723,"The Flat Earth model is a conspiracy theory surrounding the concept that the Earth is a flat, disc-shaped plane, surrounded by ice. Many ancient cultures subscribed to the idea but it was made famous again in modern times thanks to the creation of a Flat Earth society by Samuel Shenton in 1956. Mark Sargent, an avid member of the club and author of several books on the topic, revealed one reason why he believes it is more than just a conspiracy.

Speaking during Netflix documentary “Behind the Curve”, Mr Sargant claimed his theory was superior to everything NASA has told us for years. Taking the production crew to a beach near his home, Mr Sargant pointed at the city of Seattle across the water. He said in 2018: “Here’s an example if you want to see it real quick. “So like the buildings in the distance – right out there – that is Seattle.

“You should not be able to see it. “There should be hundreds of feet of curvature between us and them.” Mr Sargant went on to dismiss any scientific reasoning for the revelation, before claiming the Flat Earth theory answers all the questions. He added: “You can say it’s refraction, or it’s atmospheric effects, no – not in every weather condition, not in every light condition. “This is why science is having a problem combating what we are doing.

“Neil deGrasse Tyson says it’s a growing anti-intellectual movement which borders on the end of civilisation as we know it. “But the reason why we’re winning versus science, is science just throws back maths. Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist author and leading science figure.

He has been a long time supporter of NASA, claiming the space agency deserves more funding and backing by the general public. In March 2012, he testified before the United States Senate Science Committee, stating: ""Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. ""For twice that – a penny on a dollar – we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th-century birthright to dream of tomorrow.""

20,63,"“The folksiness will irk some critics … But criticizing Friedman for humanizing and boiling down big topics is like complaining that Mick Jagger used sex to sell songs: It is what he does well.” –John Micklethwait, review of Thank You for Being Late, in The New York Times

With apologies to Mr. Micklethwait, the hands that typed these lines implying Thomas Friedman is a Mick Jagger of letters should be chopped off and mailed to the singer’s doorstep in penance. Mick Jagger could excite the world in one note, while Thomas Friedman needs 461 pages to say, “Shit happens.” Joan of Arc and Charles Manson had more in common.

Thomas Friedman was once a man of great influence. His columns were must-reads for every senator and congressperson. He helped spread the globalization gospel and push us into war in Iraq. But he’s destined now to be more famous as a literary figure.

No modern writer has been lampooned more. Hundreds if not thousands of man-hours have been spent teaching robots to produce automated Friedman-prose, in what collectively is a half-vicious, half-loving tribute to a man who raised bad writing to the level of an art form.

We will remember Friedman for interviewing 76 percent of the world’s taxi drivers, for predicting “the next six months will be critical” on 14 occasions over two and a half years (birthing the neologism, “the Friedman unit“), and for his unmatched, God-given ability to write nonsensical metaphors, like his classic “rule of holes”: “When you’re in one, stop digging. When you’re in three, bring a lot of shovels.”

Friedman’s great anti-gift is his ability to use many words when only a few are necessary. He became famous as a newspaper columnist for taking simple one-sentence observations like, “Wow, everyone has a cell phone these days,” and blowing them out into furious 850-word trash-fires of mismatched imagery and circular argument.

The double-axel version of this feat was to then rewrite that same column over and over again, in the same newspaper, only piling on more incongruous imagery and skewing rhetoric to further stoke that one thought into an even higher and angrier fire.

For nearly two decades now, Friedman has been telling us that something big is happening, technology is growing at a rate beyond the ability of humans to adapt (this is where the part about noticing everyone has a cell phone comes in), and that we have to stop doing things the old way and take a brave step into the future.

He wrote this column so many times that even four years ago – eight Friedman units – Hamilton Nolan wrote a piece in Gawker titled “Thomas Friedman writes his only column again” (Friedman’s “only column” has by now outlived hundreds of media outlets, Gawker and my own New York Press among them). Nolan cited a piece in the Times called “The Rise of Popularism,” in which Friedman argued, again, that technology was racing past humanity’s ability to govern itself wisely.

A very conservative guess is that Friedman has written this column at least a hundred times. Maybe 200. Maybe more. If you’re rolling your eyes at this, check yourself. Think about what an awesome accomplishment that is. It takes an extraordinary discipline to turn one sentence of thought into hundreds of thousands of words.

We all repeat ourselves in the punditry business. Most of us only have a few ideas. Friedman has fewer than most – it’s really just one, technology future derp! – but he’s attacked that one idea with such relentless evangelical energy that he is leaving behind as a monument to it the literary equivalent of the Giza pyramid complex.

This decades-long gigantic art project is based upon a vast architecture of needless complication, a process he describes in this new book of his, Thank You for Being Late, as “translating English into English.”

Build a sentence into a column; build a column into many columns; build many columns into a book; build one book into many books. Then start over!

Eleven years ago, when Friedman wrote his seminal explainer book, The World is Flat – a book whose title metaphor was hilariously based on the wrong premise that people are more interconnected on a flat earth than on a round one – he combined two giant sets of metaphors to describe that same idea that technology was outpacing our ability to govern ourselves.

He said rapid changes in the world were being fueled by 10 “flatteners” (things like the end of communism, Netscape, outsourcing, etc.) which in turn were amplified by he said were four “steroids”: Digital, Mobile, Personal and Virtual.

Those four steroids actually turned out to be six – changing or extending the terms of his imagery midstream is a classic Friedmanism – and the sixth “steroid,” new wireless devices, was actually a new group of steroids he called “uber-steroids.”

This was confusing because the tenth item in Friedman’s list of “flatteners” was the group of four steroids. So his last flattener was a new group of steroids and his last steroid was a new group of uber-steroids.

Which meant we had uber-steroids amplifying steroids amplifying flatteners, with each list comprising items that belonged to other lists. He mashed all of that together for 470 pages or so.

Eleven years and countless columns later, the new book Thank You for Being Late takes that same structure and boldly complicates it. This book is built, again, around the idea that technological change is advancing beyond our ability to adapt. The culprits this time are three great “Accelerations”: Moore’s Law (microchip processing power doubles every 18 to 24 months), the market (globalization) and Mother Nature, which is his English-language term for the English-language term, “climate change and biodiversity loss.”

These Three Accelerations in turn are transforming five key “realms,” which he lists as “the workplace, politics, geopolitics, ethics, and the community.”

If you’re wondering what’s left over when you subtract, from the subset of all things, “the workplace, politics, geopolitics, ethics, and the community,” you’re on to something. Because it turns out that the book is about how something is happening to – everything! “In short,” Friedman says, in the opening chapter of Late, “this book is one giant column about the world today.”

Incidentally, whenever Friedman uses the phrase, “In short…” he’s about to take the short form of an idea and make it longer, e.g. “In short, the only way for Mexico to thrive is with a strategy of reform retail that will enable it to beat China to the top, not the bottom, because China is not focused on beating Mexico as much as it is on beating America.”

To his credit, in Thank You for Being Late, Friedman debuts the use of, “To make a short story long,” which isn’t exactly fixing the problem. But it is funnier.

So how giant is this new giant column? Really giant. There aren’t enough drugs in the world to get anyone through Thank You for Being Late in one sitting.

Take the chapter about Mother Nature, which opens with a story about a day in July, 2015 when the heat index in southern Iran reached 163 degrees. That news item gives the author an opening to introduce the concept of a “black elephant,” an ominous (if you know Friedman) term apparently explained to him by environmentalist Adam Sweidan:

“[It is] a cross between a ‘black swan’ – a rare, low-probability, unanticipated event with enormous ramifications – and ‘the elephant in the room’: a problem that is widely visible to everyone, yet that no one wants to address, even though we absolutely know that one day it will have vast, black-swan-like consequences.”

You would think he could just say, “The climate change problem is a cross between a black swan and the elephant in the room – or, as I like to call it, a Black Elephant.”

Instead he leads audiences through drawn-out explanations of two everyday terms. Moreover his unnecessary definition of “the elephant in the room” contains the phrase “black swan,” making what was originally a relatively simple idea now a kind of circular movie-within-a-movie image that is more than a little hard to follow: “A black elephant is a cross between a black swan event and the elephant in the room, which is an ignored but visibly obvious problem that will inevitably become a black swan event.”

You’re still grappling with that when you learn “there are a herd of environmental black elephants out there.” Friedman names at least four: global warming, deforestation, ocean acidification and mass biodiversity extinction. He quotes Sweidan as saying of these: “When they hit, we’ll claim they were black swans that no one could have predicted, but in fact they were black elephants, very visible right now.”

Friedman just got finished telling us that a black elephant is half black swan, and half elephant in the room that will inevitably become a black swan. But now that half-swan, half swan-within-an-elephant is being contrasted with a black swan: in the near future, things that are really black elephants will be misidentified as black swans.

So that’s weird. While you’re sorting that out, Friedman tells you that the you that a 163-degree heat index in Iran is another black elephant, because “you can see it sitting in a room, you can feel it, and you can read about it in the newspaper.” He adds:

“Like any black elephant, you also know that it is so far outside the norm that it has all the characteristics of a black swan – that it is the harbinger of some very big, unpredictable changes in our climate system we may be unable to control.”

The next thing he says is that we spend tons of money preparing for the relatively unlikely event of nuclear war, but virtually nothing to prevent a very likely climate change catastrophe. He could have just led the chapter with that. But that would defeat the purpose of translating English into English.

You’re still wondering what happened to that elephant reading a newspaper about a black swan roasting in the desert when Friedman moves on to the next space-devouring exercise, telling us about the four phrases we need to master to learn “climate-speak.”

All four sound like the same idea and are immediately forgettable:

“Just a few years ago… but then something changed.”

“Wow, I’ve never seen that before.”

“Well, usually, but now I don’t know anymore.”

“We haven’t seen anything like that since.”

Quick, name any of those phrases you just read. You can’t! But you “have to master” all of them to grasp the rapidity of climate disturbances, which Friedman now describes as Mother Nature moving into the “second half of the chessboard.”

This is a reference to a metaphor from an earlier chapter recalling the ancient tale of the mathematician who asked a king for a reward. The master asked to have one grain of rice put on one corner of a chessboard, and then to have twice as many put on the next square, and to keep going, on and on to the end. The punchline is that after doubling down 64 times, you end up with 18 quintillion grains of rice or something – more than you’d have guessed!

Which is a metaphor for how much faster than we think is the pace of change all around us, be it in technology, economic displacement or, in this case, the environment. Did you know that “megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans” the last time the CO2 concentration in the earth’s atmosphere was as high as it was in Hawaii on May 3rd, 2013, an astonishing four hundred parts per million? You probably didn’t, because things that prowl usually have feet – but anyway, back to the elephants:

“And sometimes the records being broken as Mother Nature enters the second half of the chessboard are so numerous and profound, government agencies tracking them seem to run out of even climate-speak to describe the black elephants they are seeing.”

This must be that talent for “boiling things down” that Mr. Micklethwait talked about!

God bless this man. May he never stop writing books. Let’s grow this pie as big as we can.

21,331,"The coming Full Hunter’s Moon will grace our skies on October 24th, occurring in the sign of Taurus. While the moon may be occurring in arguably the most solid and stable zodiac sign, don’t underestimate the impact of planetary outside planetary energy. This is going to be a time of change and uncertainty, but you can find peace in the chaos.

The full moon is a time in which our emotions are at an all-time high, an intensity that can lead us to make impulsive or irrational decisions. Combined with the energy created by the location of the planets at the time, this is sure to create both great excitement and a frightening uncertainty. Are you prepared to weather this intense energy?

Prepare yourself for the coming Taurus Full Moon using this ritual:

You will need:

– A handful of flowers or leaves, either dried or fresh

#1 – You need to begin by cleansing your aura, ridding yourself of the negative energy that could disrupt your ritual. As you are smudging your aura using the smudging tool of choice, recite the following:

“I am cleansing myself, freeing myself from all negativity. I am cleansing myself of the struggles and challenges from my past. I am releasing my past mistakes and cleansing myself so that I can be my true self. I am cleansing and opening my heart. I am aligned with the Universe. My heart is now open.”

#2 – Shift your attention now from your aura to the space around you. As you smudge your surroundings, recite the following:

“I cleanse and purify this space with love, light, and truth. The only energy allowed to enter into this space will be positive energy. It is safe for me to be in this space. I call this space home, and my home is cleansed and free from negativity. It is safe for me to be here. I am renewed.”

#3 – Light your incense or oil burner, selecting a scent that brings you a feeling of calm and serenity.

#4 – Light your candle, placing it either next to you on the floor or nearby on the table if you are sitting up to a table.

#5 – Close your eyes and select a symbol, either a triangle, circle or heart. Don’t overthink this, trust your intuition and choose the first symbol that comes to mind. Taking your pen and paper, draw the symbol of choice on it.

#6 – Take your candle and place it on top of the symbol you just drew, doing your best to center it on the image. Using your leaves and/or flowers, create a visually appealing or ‘pretty’ display. Follow your heart, it will provide you with the direction of where to place everything.

#7 – Find a comfortable way of sitting close to your candle. If you are sitting up to a table, make sure that your feet are flat on the floor in order to ground yourself throughout the remainder of the ritual. In the same way, if you are seated on the floor, find a position that leaves you feeling ground and secure.

#8 – Place one hand over your heart, another on your belly. The exact location will be guided by your intuition. Close your eyes, taking 10 deep breaths. Shut out all outside distractions, focusing only on your breathing in the moment.

#9 – Take a single flower or leaf from alongside your candle, placing it in the palm of your hand. Looking closely at the item, recite the following three times: “I trust the energy of Mother Earth. She guides me as to what in my life I need to release.”

#10 – Ensuring that the flower or leaf remains in the palm of your hand, bring your hands together into a prayer position. Close your eyes, focusing on your breathing again until you feel completely calm, then repeat the mantra from the previous point.

#11 – Continue to hold onto your flower or leaf as you stand up and start to shake out your body. As you do so, visualize all the pain, anxiety, and hurt falling free from your life. Continue to shake until you feel as though all the negativity has been released, leaving you cleansed and pure.

#12 – Carefully sitting back down, hold up your leaf or flower and exhale onto it, releasing any remaining negative energy or anxiety into the object. Place the flower or leaf off to the side, ensuring that you know which it is. You need to properly dispose of this item in order to remove this negative energy from your life once and for all.

#13 – Pick up another flower or leaf, placing it in the palm of your hand just as you did the last. Looking closely at it, recite the following three times: “I trust the energy of Mother Earth. She both supports and nourishes my soul.”

#14 – Just as you did the last time, bring your hands into the prayer position with the flower or leaf between your palms. Close your eyes and take 10 deep, long breaths. With each of the first 9 breaths, visualize clean, pure energy coming into your body. On the 10th breath, open your eyes looking at the flower or leaf. Visualize beauty, happiness, support, and peace coming from the leaf or flower as you inhale, entering into your body and nourishing your soul.

#15 – Place the flower or leaf off to the side with the last one.

#16 – Look back to the candle, returning your hands to the prayer position. Recite the following:

“I call on my guardian angel and my spirit guides to help me to stay calm and embrace peace. I trust that the energy of Mother Earth is always working to guide me and protect me. I genuinely appreciate the way that Mother Earth is working in my life. I appreciate all the divine beings, spirits, and guardians that work to support me, encourage me and assist me on my life’s journey. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.”

#17 – This is the end of your ritual. Blow out the candle to finish. At this point, take the two leaves or flowers that you have set aside during the ritual and dispose of them appropriately. This can be done by releasing them from the top of a tall building or hill into the wind, throwing them into the ocean or burying them in a garden or wooded area.

You can choose to dispose of the alter you have created, or to leave it set up as a reminder of the peace that you have accepted into your life.",conspiracy,C029db,flat.earth
22,1041,"Spoiler alert: The Earth is not flat.

That said, the topic is certainly a fresh one for Twitter beef.

Scientists have recognized the curvature of the Earth for more than 2,000 years. But rapper B.o.B. challenged that view on Sunday when he began tweeting images and diagrams that he said were proof the Earth is as flat as a 45.

Did we mention B.o.B. is promoting a new album? Well he is. But he insists those things are definitely not related.

So far, B.o.B. -- nee Bobby Ray Simmons -- has posted almost 50 images of the supposedly flat planet, along with quotes from the 2014 book “The Flat Earth Conspiracy” by Eric Dubay.

Thousands of fans retweeted B.o.B.’s claims that “I’m going up against the greatest liars in history ... you’ve been tremendously deceived” and “I question the international laws that prevent you from exploring Antartica and the North Pole... what’s there to hide?”

Usually, when a prominent scientist steps forward to set the record straight, that’s the end of the conversation. But not for B.o.B. He tweeted a song he’d written, “Flatline,” in which he insists “Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest” and ponders why NASA is part of the Department of Defense. (Actually, it’s not.)

Then, in a move B.o.B. probably didn’t see coming, Tyson dropped a diss track back at him.

The rapper Tyson was referring to was his nephew, Steve Tyson, who goes by “Tyson.” He wrote and recorded the song “Flat to Fact.”

In an interview with The Times, Tyson the rapper said he came up with the idea of writing a song in his famous uncle’s defense after texting with him Tuesday morning

“I recorded it in my living room,” Tyson said. “I wrote it in a couple hours and just hit record and started recording it as a track.” His uncle recorded himself reading some of his tweets to use in the song.

Not everyone was persuaded. Many followers s eemed eager to jump on the flat Earth bandwagon B.o.B. was all too eager to retweet them.

Perhaps Laura Danly will be more convincing. the curator of the Griffith Observatory, kindly agreed to address a few of B.o.B. including why you can’t see the curvature of the Earth.

“The Earth is just big,” she said. “You look out to the horizon and it looks flat. But if you get into space you can see the curvature.”

B.o.B. asserts that we have no photos of a curved Earth that weren’t “taken” by NASA. That’s not true either: the Earth, including China in 2014 and Japan just last year.

Other things that prove the Earth is round: The fact that we can observe sunrises and sunsets. The fact that people in different hemispheres see different constellations. The fact that you can fly around it in a straight line.

So for the record, the Earth: definitely round.

24,965,"Detail from Nicolaes Visscher, Novissima et Accuratissima Totius Americae Descriptio, c . 1658 (plate 1).

Over the course of the early modern period, the ‘space’ of the Netherlands opened up in several productive ways. Perhaps most famously, the Dutch created the new space of the Republic: viable political space, demarcated from an older collection of provinces, which had been gathered most recently under the auspices of the king of Spain. The Dutch also expended tremendous effort reconstituting the physical space of the Low Countries: land reclaimed from water and increased urban centres, which allowed the Republic to grow in population and gain in arable terrain. And the Dutch enlarged their commercial and colonial space by dint of their numerous overseas expansions: a ‘New’ Netherland (almost always referred to in singular form), which arose on the eastern shores of what was already then called North America; a modern ‘Batavia’, which emerged in present‐day Indonesia; and a host of Dutch forts and settlements that otherwise dotted the coasts and islands of Asia, Africa and the Americas. The Dutch also developed, just as famously, new pictorial devices to engage with space – the painterly and printerly techniques explored in this issue – and, not unrelated, new techniques to map spaces: the most robust cartographic ateliers of early modern Europe, which developed first in Antwerp and then in Amsterdam from the late sixteenth century, coincident with the rise of the Dutch Republic and the Golden Age of Dutch visual culture. Maps proliferated in the early modern Netherlands. They offered a means both to delineate space and to narrate space – to explicate how space works and to assert where their makers (and consumers) fit within these spaces. Yet maps were also important and ubiquitous material objects in the Netherlands, which occupied myriad additional spaces and which played with the many spatial and material concerns of their viewers. They engaged viewers and enticed them into their interpretive spaces.

How do Dutch maps work, and what does this reveal about the visual culture of the early modern Netherlands? These questions were famously tackled by Svetlana Alpers in The Art of Describing mostly in regard to landscape painting. Yet in many ways, her influential essay on ‘The Mapping Impulse in Dutch Art’ – the go‐to source for non‐Dutch specialists, particularly historians of science who seek to affiliate their concerns with habits of natural‐history representation with a broadly northern European tradition of painting – curiously avoided the key to this intriguing interpretive palace: the maps themselves and how they actually function.1 While Alpers’ oft‐cited chapter does open with Vermeer's Allegory of Painting and the impressive wall map by Claes Jansz. Visscher that amply fills its background, maps are otherwise relegated to the side, treated sparingly and elliptically at best – at least the form of artfully designed, lavishly embellished and meticulously printed maps that enjoyed such phenomenal popularity in the Netherlands from the late sixteenth through at least the early eighteenth century.

Maps do matter, and, as Alpers astutely points out, cartographic materials played a significant and instructive role in the visual, social and indeed the political culture of the early modern Dutch Republic. They were ubiquitous in more ways than one: as décor in houses and paintings; as devices of learning and social standing; as media of cultural and political messaging. In a vital sense, however, these roles remain conspicuously absent in her analysis, inadequately problematized and not at all ‘deconstructed’ – to invoke the language of the new critical cartography that was being developed precisely when Alpers was formulating her insights into Dutch visual culture.2 Maps as productive sources (as opposed to theorized ‘impulses’) are only lightly glossed in Alpers’ essay, their most superficial features brought to bear on a, by contrast, highly sophisticated argument about forms of ‘mapped’ landscapes (as she terms it), best exemplified by the flat panoramic paintings of Philips Koninck. This inverted theoretical focus distorts our perspective of Dutch (and other) maps and relegates to the periphery an enormously dynamic visual source in the early modern Netherlands. It also irons out – unnecessarily – the stimulating complexities of cartographic sources and the promising possibilities of Alpers’ implied query: what do maps offer to scholars of Dutch visual culture? Rather than a ‘flat working surface’, a Dutch map of this period was typically dense and jagged, presenting the viewer with multiple angles of interpretive entry, as the essays of this issue show for other media and genres. Rather than offering a ‘detached or perhaps even … culturally unbiased view’ – can such a source ever be possible? – these profusely layered artefacts furnish critical insight into and material evidence of the visual culture that Alpers aims to address.3 Early modern maps are delightfully thick objects and fundamentally material things. They illustrate modes of representation and craft, and they encourage various points of vision and interpretation. As it turns out, maps are anything but ‘flat’. They richly demonstrate, in their own way, the ‘picturing impulse’ of early modern Dutch culture.

This brief intervention aims not so much to argue with Alpers as to consider a part of her argument that was left relatively under‐scrutinized: the workings of Dutch maps. My goal is less to analyse how these maps work – there is a vast and expanding literature that does just that4 – or even how they work in the context of early modern Dutch painting, but rather to explore the qualities of cartographic design that might speak to the thematics of seeing and sensing pictures, so that they might contribute, in this way, to the broader understanding of Dutch visual culture that this issue sets out to explore. Maps are indubitably thick: they gesture relentlessly toward their materiality and to the challenge their makers face in rendering into two dimensions what begins as three – the same challenge confronted by Dutch painters, as several of the essays gathered here so elegantly argue. Maps are theatrical: they stage global space in a profusely embellished form – they rarely offer mere, austere ‘description’ – and they dramatize for their viewers ways of processing both the lands and waters of the world and the things and events that occur within them. And – as this might imply – maps are narrational: they narrate spaces, frame histories and posit polemics – much like Baroque theatre, to be sure, yet also like genres of painting of the period, both in the Netherlands and elsewhere.

To demonstrate a few of these qualities, I turn, naturally, to a map: Nicolaes Visscher's immensely popular Novissima et Accuratissima Totius Americae Descriptio (first edition c . 1658; plate 1), published more or less contemporaneously with Vermeer's Allegory of Painting (c . 1666–68). Visscher's printed map has an impressive history, going backward and forward, and touching as well the key cartographic source of Alpers’ inquiry.5 Its original author was the only son of Claes Jansz. Visscher, the well‐regarded cartographer who engraved the wall map depicted in the Vermeer Allegory . The Visscher family also had ties by marriage to the illustrious Hondius firm, makers of the Mercator atlases through the first half of the seventeenth century – they were thus kinsmen of mapping aristocracy – and their atelier in Amsterdam on the Kalverstraat placed them in the thick of all things cartographic. The younger Visscher followed in his father's professional footsteps and enjoyed considerable success, especially with his map of the Americas. The Americae went through several editions, also in revised forms engraved by other (sometimes competing) ateliers; it was appropriated for geography books, both as an insert and (in a distilled form) as a frontispiece; and it was routinely copied and pirated outright, extending its successful run well into the eighteenth century.6 It became perhaps the single most important early modern map of the western hemisphere and certainly one of the most recognized images of the New World. Its allegorical (lower) cartouche, moreover, became the all‐but standard representation of ‘America’, an iconic image that crossed easily into other genres and media.

Nevertheless, despite its prestigious lineage and its titular promises of ‘novelty’ and ‘accuracy’, the map succeeded not so much for its exacting ‘description’ as for other, arguably pictorial reasons: for its highly embellished and appealing presentation of the New World. The actual cartographic content of the map – the particular delineations of the lands and seas of the western hemisphere – was scarcely new. It derived mostly from older materials, chiefly Joan Blaeu's 1648 map of the world; the outlines of the continents of these two maps are nearly identical. This habit of replication was not at all uncommon in early modern Dutch cartography (as in other graphic arts), especially in the sort of lavishly ornamented charts that became the mainstay of Amsterdam ateliers. Nor can the Visscher map make great claims for geographic meticulousness: a prominent ‘California’ floats off the western coast of America, an island of the mapmakers’ imagination; the Great Lakes blend into one truly great lake, which leaks its contents into the Atlantic; and the long‐sought Northwest Passage is offered optimistically as readily accessible, an open sea flowing freely into Asia. The map's promise of novelty and accuracy, in other words, is rhetoric – again, a fairly common ploy in early modern mapping (as in late modern advertising). No Baconian empiricism here, but rather strategies that relate to the techniques of rhetoric – pervasive across myriad Renaissance fields of enquiry – and to the crafty practices of the workshop.

What likely sold the map, more than its less‐than‐meticulous ‘description’ of the continents, would have been the staging of the Americae and the ample ‘adornments’ that enriched Visscher's product: the four‐legged staffage that wander the open, ultimately uncharted spaces of the map (what J. B. Harley famously called its ‘silences’); the ethnographic vignettes that explicate the New World's indigenes; and, not least, the superb cartouches that fill the upper and lower divisions of the vast Pacific Ocean, at once distilling and framing the continents in terms of space and narrative.7 The charming ‘creatures in the map’ – these did not go out of style in the Renaissance – would have appealed to a range of consumers.8 Two handsome stag deer saunter across the terrain of Eastern Canada (Nova Francia on the map); they would appear to await the hunter's arrow just as do the tame deer of Ben Johnson's poetic Penshurst or any other exemplary country house. A fox gambols across the Great Plains (a scene likewise redolent of the Northern European countryside); and beavers, coveted lately by Dutch merchants for their valuable pelts, pose obediently just inland of the plainly demarcated empire of Nieu [New] Nederland .9 Further afield a pair of brown bears inhabit the open, wild west; meanwhile, a lone anteater has South America largely to himself. The two‐legged staffage of tropical America – that is, the indigenous Americans – do no hunt any exotic fauna, but one another. Their depiction in the interior of Brazil, naked and engrossed in brutal warfare, offers a synoptic view of the ‘savage’ Indian, here imagined as uncivilized if also unobtrusive.

As for the pair of cartouches, one occupying the upper left and the other the lower left portion of Visscher's print, these serve as the dual anchors of the map, the dominant pictorial elements and the keys to the artefact's interpretation (plate 2 and plate 3). They also function to stage the map's motifs and – crucially – to elucidate its overall message. It is here that both the theatrical and narrative impulses of Dutch mapping come through most vividly and most pictorially. Both cartouches follow designs by Nicolaes Pietersz. Berchem, a highly regarded landscape painter, as it turns out (and the only son of Pieter Claesz, a master of still‐life painting), who specialized in a form of idealized Italianate scenes popular in that period (a subgenre of Dutch landscape that lay conspicuously beyond Alpers’ scrutiny as putatively un‐Dutch).10 The pair of map vignettes work as an ensemble – the device of the parasol lures the viewer's eye from the vignette below to the balancing scene above – yet it is the iconic figure of America herself, who gracefully gestures to the map's ‘carved’ title, that lies at the heart of the visual programme. Berchem at once allegorized and condensed the essential qualities of the cartographic space. He packed it all in: the alluring personification of ‘America’, decked out in a dainty feathered skirt and colourful feathered headdress; the pearls, barely visible around her neck, demonstrating the region's endemic richness; the classic bow and arrow, just to her right, alluding to her habit of hunting (America also bears a stylized club); the mounds of freshly mined gold (or perhaps silver) piling up at her feet, alongside stacks of ingots that indicate the substantial mineral wealth of the continent; a pair of queerly coiled snakes, which reveal the exotic naturalia of the New World; and the central parasol, which shades America's head from the tropical sun.11 The sum of the parts tells the story of the whole: a massively rich, vaguely exotic, not‐quite‐tamed New World.

The upper cartouche furnishes another allegory, which introduces a different angle on America, yet one that is thematically complementary. A cluster of figures surrounds and supports a free‐floating, shield‐like device, which bears a patron's coat of arms and the map's dedication (to Cornelius Witsen, a major supporter of overseas trade and exploration, on the original state, yet this varies with different printings).12 The predominant figure of this cluster, a European woman hovering in the very upper‐left corner of the map, represents Christian Faith: relatively plainly dressed, she points didactically with one hand to a cross that she holds in her other hand and positions directly above the other figures. She glances not to the cross, however, but to a broad‐shouldered, sharp‐taloned, demon‐like figure below, who tumbles out of the sky: an allegory of diabolism, ejected by the Christian Church. An angel opposite and above gazes, mouth agape, at this falling devil and the wondrous turn of events, while another heavenly figure, just to the angel's left, announces per clarion the plunge of diabolism and the spread of the gospel. Finally, an Indian – the figure situated closest to the American landmass who wears the same feathered headdress as the principal ‘American’ figure of the lower cartouche, in this way linking the two vignettes – gazes in astonishment at the allegory of Faith, whose good works have apparently converted him. The cartouche recounts, in short, the Church's labours in the New World: its presumed successes casting out false faiths and diabolisms, and evangelizing among the American indigenes.13

To say that these vignettes are staged is to identify both the drama of Faith's triumphs in the New World and the several marks of theatricality that hold the ensemble together. The parasol does this formally: not only does it lure the eye upward, but it points directly to the upper Indian; were he to fall from the sky, he might pierce himself on the parasol's tasselled spike. The parasol functions, further, as a clever stage prop, a showy accoutrement that establishes the ostentatious tropicality of America (the point of the parasol abuts the very words ‘Tropicus Capricorni ’). In fact, bona fide parasols commonly served as props in Baroque theatre; and a particularly famous example of this, the engraving of Anne Bracegirdle in her popular role as ‘The Indian Queen’, alludes subtly to the Berchem allegory of America: feathers, pearls and parasol render the renowned Restoration actress adequately ‘exotic’.14 Theatrical motions – of hands and other limbs – also lend the joint cartouches a dramatic, balletic cogency: arms akimbo on either side of the title slab, hands gesturing instructively by the allegorical figures both above and below, and the scissoring feet of Christian Faith and her Indian protégé alike all serve to animate the scene. The swirling dress of Faith, swept up by the heavenly winds, and her billowing and entirely theatrical shawl (since this prop would have been utterly extraneous in the heavens) suggest, yet again, tricks of the stage – and, of course, of highly painterly composition. All of these devices heighten the drama of the map and thereby elucidate the meaning of America.

And all of these devices might also prompt the question: what is the message of the map and the narrative arch that bridges Berchem's upper and lower cartouches? The bond between Faith and America harks back to a proverbial wisdom that circulated in late medieval and early modern Europe about the inverse relation of ‘god’ and ‘gold’: wherever the latter flowed abundantly, it was proposed, the former was typically scarce (and the reverse). Such a conception of America and her endemic riches‐cum‐heathenism justified much of Habsburg Spain's early colonial action in the New World – the conquest and simultaneous conversion of the Indians. Yet it also carried an implicit moral message, which gained traction among critics of the Habsburg Conquista , especially in Northern Europe. And here we need to turn to a text, one of many that would have helped viewers read Visscher's map. A late sixteenth‐century poem, which captioned the Dutch and German editions of an engraved allegory of America, commented poignantly on this contradictory relationship between the European god and American gold (words that punned even more in the original: god and goud in Dutch):

Here the wondrous mineral wealth of America fosters her own decline; she goes from benighted idolatry to miserable slavery. The sixteenth‐century allegory (engraved by Adriaen Collaert after a design by Maarten de Vos) expresses sympathy for the doubly abused Indians. In the Visscher map, however, with its relatively neutral‐looking figure of Faith, not obviously Catholic nor Protestant, and with its pan‐colonial vision of the Americas – New France, New Netherlands, and English‐settled Virginia are all engraved into the space, no less than the nomenclature of Iberian colonial possessions in South America – the message pertains to European colonialism and European exoticism writ large. The map spells out the evangelical and imperial rise of the Old World in the New.

A map, however, even while it may possess plentiful text and even while it might be read as and with the help of text, is certainly not identical to text – it is textual and pictorial, not to mention cartographical. It is also material, of course, and while there may have been textual and iconographic foundations for such maps as Visscher's, there were also unmistakable evocations of craft and materiality. The heritage of early modern Dutch cartography goes back not so much to Ptolemy, as Alpers argues, as to the pioneering labours of Gerard Mercator and Abraham Ortelius, who drew on the traditions of late‐medieval mapping – highly pictorial and allegorical products, typically emanating from the workshops of master illuminators – and on the world of craft.16 Ortelius instinctively placed geography in the context of art: famously in relationship to history (‘Historiae oculus geographia ’), yet also in the sphere of drama.17 His Theatrum orbis terrarrum not only summons the language of the stage, but also greets its audience on its engraved title page with a recognizable proscenium (plate 4). Mercator – whose posthumously published atlas also adapted the symbols of theatre on its title page – sprang more directly from the milieu of craft. His main source of income in his early professional years came from the fabrication of mathematical and navigational instruments – this placed him in the vibrant, metal‐working ateliers of northern Europe – and, for many of the early cartographic projects with which we associate him (his work with Gemma Frisius and Gaspar à Myrica, for example, on their terrestrial globe), he served as a highly skilled engraver of brass plates. He was also an innovator in the production of commercial globes; and he was a remarkable italicist, who composed, designed and printed the first instruction book of italic script published north of the Alps. He mastered math and craft, art and ‘science’.

More to the point, the actual, tangible maps of Mercator and Ortelius go out of their way in these early years to emphasize their affiliation with modes of craft and material arts. Both mapmakers’ ateliers, in producing the first generation of ‘craft maps’ – this is the geographer John Pickles’ term for the highly pictorial, thickly ornamented maps that developed in the late sixteenth‐century Netherlands18 – make habitual reference to the process of their maps’ production and to the material arts whence they came. Thus does Mercator's Orbis Terrae Compendiosa Descriptio make literal reference to its maker's background in brass‐work by the depiction of an armillary sphere in the upper centre of the map's design, while also making more figurative allusions to metalwork in the strapwork surrounding the armillary; in the elaborate fretwork bearing the global hemispheres; and in the clever metallic tooling of the engraved frame that encases the world map (plate 5). These devices serve to emphasize the ‘thickness’ of early modern cartography – its broader project of converting three‐dimensional space into two – while also invoking the material arts with which Mercator (and many map illuminators before him) sought to affiliate himself. Thus, too, does Ortelius offer one of his most celebrated cartographic images – Abrahami Patriarchae Peregrinatio et Vita (1590), which charts the life and journeys of the Old Testament patriarch Abraham, the mapmaker's namesake – as a trompe l'oeil that invokes the illustrious art of tapestry (plate 6). Meanwhile, several other graphic techniques make more subtle gestures to various other material arts: twenty‐two circular medallion vignettes, so‐called since they evoke the bronze medallions much in fashion at that time, do the heavy‐lifting narration of Abraham's life; two superb cartouches display the map's textual apparatus and once again reference the art of strapwork (the interior sample with garlands being a particularly fine example of the genre); and two decorative masks – ‘hung’ on a strapwork cartouche, which is ‘fastened’ to a cartographic tapestry – not only lend a sense of depth to this already densely materialized map, but also allude to the world of theatre. The map, in short, offers a tour de force of spatial manipulation – to go along with its textual and pictorial narration.

Some three‐quarters of a century later, Nicolaes Visscher and Nicolaes Berchem likewise expended considerable effort in thickening their map. They collaboratively layered several illusions of space in the Americae engraving. Careful hatching around the edges of the continents and scattered islands lends a sense of depth to the hemisphere, a quality further enhanced by the ‘shadows’ cast by the ships at sea and the animals on shore (see plate 1). This imparts to what otherwise might be perceived as flat geographic space the property of density, and it grants the map's viewers an optical sense of verticality, as if they were observing the continents from an elevated, almost atmospheric altitude. The swirling figures of the upper vignette induce a dizzying lateral movement yet further up; we are now in the skies, if not quite the heavens, where shadow and wind still persist (see plate 3). The curling (upper) cartouche, which carries the map's dedication on the form of a wooden shield, also plays with the materiality of that shield: a shield bears a shield, as it were. In the lower vignette, space moves more horizontally. Here there is a quality of earthiness, as opposed to the lofty airiness above, and the conceit that the ground slopes downward along with the figures behind the ‘slab’ of cartouche who recede gently into the horizon (and presumably further into the subterranean mines from where America's gold and silver originate) (see plate 2). And if wind animates the upper scene, the sun plays that role below, casting shadows over the figure of America, thereby also accentuating the tropical heat of the land. The parasol, that most tangible of accessories of the tropics and theatre alike, stylishly shields ‘America’ from the elements, and in this way also pulls the narrative spaces together.

Craft maps, a genre developed outstandingly in the picture‐rich culture of the early modern Netherlands, drew from the arts of painting and engraving, and from the fields of geography and the material arts. Their form owed much to the practices of ateliers: to printerly habits of delineating and ‘describing’, to be sure, yet also to modes of narrating and embellishing space, of crafting and thickening maps. Indeed, within the intricate matrix of early modern Dutch workshops, the makers of maps borrowed as well as loaned; images from cartographic sources and geography books moved from printed media (textual as well as iconographic), yet also to material arts. ‘America’ would redeploy over the coming decades from maps to forms of tapestry, ceramic (especially porcelain, once Europe mastered its own techniques of production), lacquer‐ware, cut glass, and so on, as the image steadily gained in popularity. Visscher's cartographic images, in other words, moved from the two‐dimensional space of the map back to the three‐dimensional space of the decorative arts from where Mercator and Ortelius had drawn their earlier inspiration.

Both the lineage and the influence of ‘craft’ maps are rich in numerous ways. Early modern Dutch maps are anything but mere ‘description’, and they most certainly illustrate, pace Alpers, abundant ‘pictorial marks of [social and political] authority’.19 They illustrate and narrate and dramatize much more, and much that speaks rather productively to Alpers’ and our concerns with Dutch visual culture. For maps such as those produced by Visscher and his contemporaries ask us – just as other prints and paintings do – to think about space and its representation. Dutch maps use graphic forms and pictorial devices to stage space and to present the drama of space from multiple angles and perspectives. Visscher's map, complemented by Berchem's vignettes, displays the drama of European expansion from up high and down low, from the fauna‐rich interiors of the American continents to the ship‐peppered seas that surround them. It invokes the tricks of theatre – rhetoric and gesture, evocation and insinuation, props and propaganda – to narrate space, in this case the spaces of European conquest, colonialism and empire. And it narrates that space in assorted ways, just as history narrates and as other textual and pictorial genres narrate: to be the eye of history is not necessarily to be wholly mute (or purely descriptive). It does all this, again as other visual sources do, as a means to entice its viewers. The Americae beckon in myriad ways: Berchem's figure of ‘America’ seduces its viewer with her opulent pearls and exotic feathers, tactile prompts of supreme allure; Visscher's sheet map invokes multiple registers of materiality, encouraging an intense sense of touch, depth and space; and the Americae , of course, arouse wide‐ranging colonial desires, which surely reached across to several early modern European aspirants of imperial worlds. Early modern Dutch maps, in these many ways, surely exhibit the shared impulses of painting and cartography, yet this does not so much demonstrate a flattened mapping impulse in Dutch art as it reveals the rich, thick, pictorial impulses in Dutch maps.",mainstream,M0b501,flat.earth
25,367,"The Earth is not flat. We all agree on that right? Apparently, rapper B.o.B isn't on the same page as the rest of us as he just set up a GoFundMe campaign in order to prove the Earth is flat.

This is not a joke, at least, it doesn't appear to be one. Rapper B.o.B, whose real name is Bobby Ray Simmons Jr., plans to raise money to launch satellites so he can finally prove the Earth is flat to all of us. I'm not sure why the thousands of other satellites and images from those satellites aren't good enough. But sometimes, you've just got to do it yourself.

A large proportion of flat-Earthers believe the Earth is a disk with sort of dome over it containing our atmosphere. Above that, the Sun, stars, and moon all do a dance above the disc-shaped Earth.

B.o.B has tweeted several times that because objects in the far-off horizon don't appear to curve, the Earth must be flat.

The above tweet garnered the attention of Neil DeGrasse Tyson, famed astrophysicist. He points out that, yes, the Earth has obscured 150 feet of Manhattan but since most buildings are much taller than that, you can still see Manhattan's skyscrapers from 16 miles away.

The flat Earth belief has grown in popularity recently as a result of high-profile celebrities and athletes supporting the belief the Earth is flat. This includes Kyrie Irving, Sammy Watkins, and Tila Tequila who have all expressed belief in a flat Earth.

The GoFundMe campaign plans to launch multiple satellites into space, which will allow the rapper to observe and disprove the widely held belief that the Earth is not flat. He's looking for just $1 million, a small price tag to completely upend one of the most basic understandings of our solar system.

If all this attention gets you curious about donating to B.o.B.'s GoFundMe campaign, let me suggest a few others that may be more deserving of your money.

26,774,"Thousands of people calling for a deal on climate change at next week's United Nations conference in Copenhagen marched through central London on Saturday, encircling the Houses of Parliament in a human wave of blue-clad demonstrators.London's Metropolitan Police said about 20,000 people joined the Stop Climate Chaos march, which began at Grosvenor Square and wound its way to the Parliament building on the River Thames. Organizers put the turnout at 40,000.""We wanted to make a positive statement,"" said retired teacher Pip Cartwright, 72, from Witney southern England. ""It's for the future. It's not my generation that's going to have the problem to solve.""The coalition -- which includes groups such as Oxfam, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the WWF -- called the protest ""The Wave,"" and organizers asked marchers to dress in blue. The march ended with a mass ""wave"" around Parliament. Thousands more people attended climate protests in Glasgow and Belfast, as well as in European cities including Brussels, Paris and Dublin. (In pics: Save the world from catastrophe) ""The U.K. government must fight for a comprehensive, fair and binding deal at Copenhagen -- that is our demand today and we expect it to be fulfilled,"" Oxfam GB chief executive Barbara Stocking said in a statement. ""They must return home with a strong, effective climate deal both for our own sakes in the U.K. and for the millions of poor people already suffering from the effects of climate change around the world.""Also on Saturday, Britain's Met Office said it would publish some of the data it uses to analyze climate change, after thousands of pieces of correspondence between some of the world's leading climate scientists were stolen from the University of East Anglia and leaked to the Internet. Skeptics of man-made global warming say the mails prove that scientists have been conspiring to hide evidence about climate change.On Friday, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Rajendra Pachauri, said the issue raised by the e-mails was serious and would be looked at in detail.Most climate scientists say their content has no bearing on the principles of climate change itself, but the leak -- just before the Copenhagen summit -- has been politically explosive,Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Saturday that ""the scientific evidence is strong"" and it was essential for a deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in CopenhagenHe said those opposing action were ""anti-change, anti-science, anti-reform, almost flat-Earth"" groups.Met Office spokesman Barry Gromett said data from 1,000 weather stations around the world, covering 150 years, will be released early next week. The office has written to 188 countries to ask for permission to release more data from a further 4,000 stations.Ahead of the march through central London, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams offered prayers for negotiators in Copenhagen and urged people not to listen to those who say there's a choice between ""looking after human beings and looking after the Earth.""""If we make ourselves a bit less comfortable, if we draw back from a little bit of our space and liberty so that others may have the space and comfort they need for life, thank God,"" Williams said.Later, a group of climate activists pitched tents amid the fountains and statues in central London's Trafalgar Square to draw attention to the upcoming summit.

27,756,"The latest in a line of flat Earth truthers in sports is … Boston Celtics GM Danny Ainge?

As you may know, he's referring to the fact that Kyrie Irving has repeatedly questioned if the Earth is round, although he once said he was trolling and then went back and explained his beliefs.

So, there are two explanations about that tweet:

1. Irving and Ainge have held extensive discussions about their respective beliefs about the shape of the Earth and the guard convinced the exec that the Earth is indeed flat. Ainge decided to share his discovery with the world late on a Monday night.

2. Ainge had just finished watching Irving drop 47 points on the Dallas Mavericks in the Celtics' 16th straight win, and he's so tickled by Irving's performance this year that Ainge basically joked something like this: ""Hey, I'll believe whatever you want me to believe, Kyrie, as long as you keep playing like that.""

28,887,"The Great Pyramid is a true masterpiece and has rightly earned the title of a “Wonder”. It was built with such precision that our current technology cannot replicate it.

Historical analysis shows that the Pyramids were built between 2589 and 2504 BC.

There are so many interesting facts about this Pyramid that it baffles archaeologists, scientists, astronomers and tourists.

Here are the facts:



01. The pyramid is estimated to have around 2,300,000 stone blocks that weigh from 2 to 30 tons each and there are even some blocks that weigh over 50 tons.

02. The Pyramid of Menkaure, the Pyramid of Khafre and the Great Pyramid of Khufu are precisely aligned with the Constellation of Orion.

03. The base of the pyramid covers 55,000 m2 (592,000 ft 2) with each side greater than 20,000 m2 (218,000 ft2) in area.

04. The interior temperature is constant and equals the average temperature of the earth, 20 Degrees Celsius (68 Degrees Fahrenheit).

05. The outer mantle was composed of 144,000 casing stones, all of them highly polished and flat to an accuracy of 1/100th of an inch, about 100 inches thick and weighing approx. 15 tons each.

06. The cornerstone foundations of the pyramid have ball and socket construction capable of dealing with heat expansion and earthquakes.

07. The mortar used is of an unknown origin (Yes, no explanation given). It has been analyzed and its chemical composition is known but it can’t be reproduced. It is stronger than the stone and still holding up today.

08. It was originally covered with casing stones (made of highly polished limestone). These casing stones reflected the sun’s light and made the pyramid shine like a jewel. They are no longer present being used by Arabs to build mosques after an earthquake in the 14th century loosened many of them.

It has been calculated that the original pyramid with its casing stones would act like gigantic mirrors and reflect light so powerful that it would be visible from the moon as a shining star on earth. Appropriately, the ancient Egyptians called the Great Pyramid “Ikhet”, meaning the “Glorious Light”.

How these blocks were transported and assembled into the pyramid is still a mystery. – http://www.gizapyramid.com/general.htm

09. Aligned True North: The Great Pyramid is the most accurately aligned structure in existence and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error. The position of the North Pole moves over time and the pyramid was exactly aligned at one time.

10. Center of Land Mass: The Great Pyramid is located at the center of the land mass of the earth. The east/west parallel that crosses the most land and the north/south meridian that crosses the most land intersect in two places on the earth, one in the ocean and the other at the Great Pyramid.

11. The four faces of the pyramid are slightly concave, the only pyramid to have been built this way.

12. The centers of the four sides are indented with an extraordinary degree of precision forming the only 8 sided pyramid, this effect is not visible from the ground or from a distance but only from the air, and then only under the proper lighting conditions.

This phenomenon is only detectable from the air at dawn and sunset on the spring and autumn equinoxes, when the sun casts shadows on the pyramid.

13. The granite coffer in the “King’s Chamber” is too big to fit through the passages and so it must have been put in place during construction.

14. The coffer was made out of a block of solid granite. This would have required bronze saws 8-9 ft. long set with teeth of sapphires. Hollowing out of the interior would require tubular drills of the same material applied with a tremendous vertical force.

15. Microscopic analysis of the coffer reveals that it was made with a fixed point drill that used hard jewel bits and a drilling force of 2 tons.

16. The Great Pyramid had a swivel door entrance at one time. Swivel doors were found in only two other pyramids: Khufu’s father and grandfather, Sneferu and Huni, respectively.

17. It is reported that when the pyramid was first broken into that the swivel door, weighing some 20 tons, was so well balanced that it could be opened by pushing out from the inside with only minimal force, but when closed, was so perfect a fit that it could scarcely be detected and there was not enough crack or crevice around the edges to gain a grasp from the outside.

18. With the mantle in place, the Great Pyramid could be seen from the mountains in Israel and probably the moon as well.

19. The weight of the pyramid is estimated at 5,955,000 tons. Multiplied by 10^8 gives a reasonable estimate of the earth’s mass.

20. The Descending Passage pointed to the pole star Alpha Draconis, circa 2170-2144 BCE. This was the North Star at that point in time. No other star has aligned with the passage since then.

21. The southern shaft in the King’s Chamber pointed to the star Al Nitak (Zeta Orionis) in the constellation Orion, circa 2450 BCE The Orion constellation was associated with the Egyptian god Osiris. No other star aligned with this shaft during that time in history.

22. Sun’s Radius: Twice the perimeter of the bottom of the granite coffer times 10^8 is the sun’s mean radius. [270.45378502 Pyramid Inches* 10^8 = 427,316 miles]

23. The curvature designed into the faces of the pyramid exactly matches the radius of the earth.

24. Khufu’s pyramid, known as the great pyramid of Giza, is the oldest and largest, rising at 481 feet (146 meters). Archaeologists say it was the tallest structure in the world for about 3, 800 years.

25. The relationship between Pi (p) and Phi (F) is expressed in the fundamental proportions of the Great Pyramid.

29,351,"As far as failed predictions go, this one may be the original. Everyone knows the world is round, right? Not so. Homer thought it was flat. Ancient Buddhist cosmology agreed that earth was like a horizontal disk. Hebrew Scriptures suggested it might resemble a dome. Some in ancient China claimed it to be a square. And when Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492, many Europeans thought he might reach its edge. Some scholars suggest that a round-earth theory had more early support than one might think. Echoes of a round-earth cosmology can be heard in Plato, and 6th century B.C. Greek philosopher Pythagoras (yep, same a² + b² = c² guy) is said to have agreed. Around the time of Christ, an Asian belief held that the earth was like the yolk in an egg, and Muslim scholars supported a round earth by the 9th century. The Western world joined the round-earth campaign a little late, when Magellan's 1519 global voyage seemed to confirm the round hypothesis. Yet, as is the case with many strange predictions, a handful of believers like the Flat Earth Society still hold fast to their convictions. The rest of us would say however, they are, um, flat-out wrong.

30,261,"Browsing through history, it’s very clear that the world has undergone many monumental shifts in society that have uprooted it’s very foundation in place of new seed.

A paradigm shift is a fundamental change in approach or underlining assumptions. For example, when Pythagoras proposed that the Earth was round instead of flat, the foundation of science and people’s understanding of the world was completely changed. Similarly, when the Industrial Revolution took place there was a complete shift in manufacturing, lifestyle, and economics.

A paradigm shift can literally shake a society to its core, taking it off its current path and putting it on a brand new one. Though it might appear the opposite in the corporate controlled mainstream news, it appears that the entire world is in the very early stages of a paradigm shift. These shifts take place in many of the worlds most basic elements and redefine how life functions.

Here are 8 signs the world is undergoing a paradigm shift:

1. The Power of the Internet and the Age of Information

The Internet is arguably the greatest invention in the history of man. Never in our known history has man had access to such a broad range of diverse information from all over the world at the tips of his fingers. Many forget that the Internet has only really been commercialized in the west since the early 1990’s and its spread across the world hasn’t even come close to peaking yet. The Internet is undoubtedly giving rise to the Age of Information as people become more awake to what’s really going on in the world.

A multitude of information is now accessible if one knows where to look. People can now learn new skills or hear different versions of the truth in mere minutes. The Internet is not only giving rise to an open access of information, but communication is almost instantaneous all over the world. It is paramount that the Internet remain an open decentralized system in which everyone can freely add and operate if this paradigm shift is to continue. It feeds almost all other shifts.



2. The Ascent Of the Independent Non-Corporate Online Media

Thanks solely to the Internet, the rise in independent journalism has taken off. Alternative media has become an increasingly popular choice for those wishing to stay truly informed, especially younger generations. People are continually switching off cable news (cable TV all together), and instead resorting to online sources. While mainstream news is still the number one source of current world events for the masses, the tide is slowly changing as people are awakening to the fact that corporate sponsored media is mostly propaganda and half-truths.

War is becoming much harder to justify as independent journalists have shined the light on what the powers that be never wanted anyone to see. A prime example is the conflict in Syria in which the establishment, despite the lack of popular support, so desperately wanted to start a war that when the rebels they were funding used chemical weapons, it was then blamed on the Assad government to protect their investment and design. Thanks to independent journalists, a war has so far been averted since it was revealed that the U.S. was in bed with the rebel groups and it was the rebels who used the chemical weapons. This new faction of journalism will give peace a legitimate chance as all dirty laundry is now being aired and corrupt alliances exposed. This in turn has allowed many people to deprogram from the countless media they have taken in over the years and see the world through a clearer lens in which the truth is more evident.

Though it will never be broadcast on mainstream news, the real threat of a U.S. dollar collapse as the world reserve currency is very real. The paradigm of central bank controlled economies that can issue credit and zero percent interest rates through nearly unlimited printing of money backed by nothing is an illusion that is beginning to break down. It’s not just the U.S. dollar that’s under threat, but many other central currencies such as the Euro and Yen. Massive equity bubbles are being blown up by this cheap credit along with massive debt that will be nearly impossible to pay back with the current economies in which only the very elite benefit.

Many countries are waking up to the fact that, like all other bubbles, these bubbles will burst and they are beginning to break away from the dollar. Examples include the buildup of a new central bank in the emerging economy of the BRICS group, the countless countries passing trade agreements in which bypassing the U.S. dollar (including agreements in oil), and the persistent selling of treasury stocks by the Chinese government who quite often are the last resort buyer of U.S. debt. Not only has there been a shift in the pecking order of fiat paper currencies, but decentralized crypto-currencies like Bitcoin are threatening the very system of fiat money and the centralized control a select few elite have on that system through central banks. This would shift power worldwide.



4. The Rise of the Peer-to-Peer Economy

A Peer-to-Peer (P20) Economy is a de-centralized model whereby two individuals interact to buy or sell goods and services directly with each other, without intermediation by a third-party, or without the use of a company or business. We see this being used by companies like Air BnB, Uber, Craigslist, Sidecar, and Dogvacay among others. Often referred to as a sharing economy, there is no centralized control of power, allowing people to more directly profit from their goods/services rather than pay unnecessary middlemen along the way.

This is a trend that is sure to grow as technology makes it easier for people to make it on their own and allows for people to own their means of production and finished goods, instead of just being paid in the production process. The peer-to-peer economy is also possible through the abundance of goods already out there, allowing for goods to be shared and recycled rather than thrown away and reproduced. Not only is the peer-to-peer economy growing, but many young people are ditching the career 9-5 jobs and branching off into independent careers or job hopping. The top down business model in economics has now found a legitimate system in which a decentralized bottom up approach gives the power back to the people.

The shift towards renewable energy is a forgone conclusion as renewable energy is the way of the future. In fact, the shift looks to be happening faster than people realize. According to the Global Energy Initiative, “Numerous scenarios projected levels of renewable energy for 2020 that already were surpassed by 2010.” The IEA states that, “In 2012, the world relied on renewable sources for around 13.2% of its total primary energy supply, and in 2013 renewables accounted for almost 22% of global electricity generation.”

With increased technological capabilities along with ever-growing concern over the state of the environment, the world is beginning to not only shift towards renewables, but the power over energy supplies and grids is decentralizing. For example, home solar panels or the new Tesla Powerwall, would enable people to access their own energy directly from the sun without going through middlemen. Another example is a local city like Burlington, VT being the first city in the U.S. to use 100% renewable energy; even whole countries like Paraguay, Iceland and Norway being 100% renewable. Cheap localized energy is on the horizon along with the very real possibility Nikola Teslaonce envisioned, which is a world of free energy.

The reemergence of organic food is not only on the rise, but the use of farmers markets and locally grown food is on the rise as well. According to the Non GMO project, “In more than 60 countries around the world, including Australia, Japan, and all of the countries in the European Union, there are significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs.” The rise is so strong that according to the Organic Trade Association, “Supply shortages [of organics] are one of the greatest challenges facing the industry today. Despite continued growth in production, handlers are not able to keep up with demand.”

Thanks in large part to the Internet and non-corporate sponsored research, people are beginning to understand the importance behind knowing exactly what’s in the food one consumes and how it directly correlates to health. This has put mounting pressure on food businesses to adapt. The signs are already evident as Chipotle sees their profits increase while operating completely Non-GMO, while sales giants such as McDonalds see profits continue to decrease amidst health concerns over their food. Many are beginning to truly care what goes into their body and the rise of localized non-organic food in this country is a direct result of this health-conscious shift.

7. The Understanding Of a World of Abundance

As Gandhi famously said, “The world has enough for every man’s needs, but not for every man’s greed.” People are finally awaking to the fact that there is enough to go around, just not with the current systems in place. No one is saying there is enough for everyone to live at current western consumption rates, however with adoption of renewable energy, new forms of decentralized government and economics, and the increase in the usage of technological capabilities, there is more than enough for everyone in the world to live happily. For example, the world produces enough food for 10 billion people, yet many go starving as a result of faulty systems of distribution. Another example is water; there is more than enough water on the planet, but it’s the economic systems that get in the way of technology.

The notion of scarcity has long haunted the systems of government and economics, but now a new paradigm of abundance is beginning to take root in the minds of people. The Venus project is a prime example of an alternative resource based economy in which sustainability and resource supply are taken into account. A world of abundance with zero emission is no longer just a pipe dream, but could very well become a reality as people think in terms of abundance.

Finally a consciousness shift is underway in which people are starting to see themselves as more than just individual people operating in an isolated bubble, but instead as a connected piece in the collective consciousness of planet Earth. The Internet, along with the increased capacity for travel, has allowed people from all over the world to connect. So many parts of the global society have become interconnected and people are beginning to take notice of not only their own country, but countries abroad.

Many are beginning to realize that one group of people suffering means everyone is suffering. This interconnection to everything has given rise to practices such as meditation, yoga, and travel, as well as the continued global acceptance towards mind altering organic substances like marijuana and mushrooms. People are beginning to emotionally connect to life all over the world and not just their immediate home and surroundings. This new reality is showing people that there is more to life than money, as connection to all living things is equally, if not more, valuable.

As one can see, the world is very much in the early stages of a shift in consciousness and design. These shifts are leading to a growing decentralization movement in which the power controls of society are taken from the few and given to the many. Obviously, there is a very strong force at play that is fighting against this paradigm shift. This force is fighting for centralization of power in almost all facets of life. There can be no doubt of the presence of this resistance when one examines the ever-increasing wealth and power gap that is out of control in this country.

The actions taken by these elite organizations are getting more radical and desperate by the day. With all that being said, the global paradigm shift has one advantage that I believe will be the game changer, and that’s the will of the people. This is not just the people of a a single country, but internationally, as united global movements such as Occupy Wall street, the Arab Spring, and March Against Monsanto are happening simultaneously all over the world around central causes. So wake-up and participate, for we are in the early stages of a revolutionary paradigm shift in the consciousness of the masses that can truly change society for the better.

31,478,"1st Peter 4:12-17, “Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? More and more, as I grow older, I am rejoicing and thanking and praising God for His blessings in my life. Most of all, I thank God for the gift of His dear Son, Jesus Christ. John 3:16, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” During my 52 years of life, I have been through much suffering, pain of soul, frustration, loneliness, health afflictions, loss and betrayal; yet I am so happy to be a child of God. I thank God for the roof over my head, even though it is not mine. I thank God for the vehicle that I drive, even though it is worn and has a tire going flat that I need to get fixed. I thank God for my body, even though I have incurable stenosis and radiculopathy from a neck injury which afflicts me horribly with chronic pain 24/7. I thank God for my eyes, even though I am near-sighted and cannot see well at a distance. I do not like being divorced and alone, but I thank God that I wasn't the one who filed for divorce, and I thank God for my family. I thank God for my imperfect parents, imperfect pastor, imperfect childhood, imperfect life, imperfect free country that I am blessed to live in. Thank you Lord for all your blessings on me! I rejoice in knowing that my name is written in Heaven, in the Lamb's Book of Life. I thank God that He forgave me for all my sins at age 13, when I was born-again, which gives me the example, power and motivation to forgive others who have hurt me. I have forgiven everyone in my life. Ephesians 4:31-32, “Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.” It doesn't matter if others hate me, hurt me, or mistreat me, they are accountable to God for their actions, not me. I choose to love everyone with God's unconditional love. I receive a lot of e-mails from people struggling with sin, suffering from depression, angry at God, confused and hurting in their body and soul. I love helping all of them. For those of you who know me better than others, I love writing lengthy e-mails, pouring out my heart to help people. I am sure I even annoy some of my web visitors, writing a book back to them. Please pardon me! A lot of that stems from my loneliness as a single man. I love when people ask me questions, and I have an answer in the Lord to help them for Christ. It is my privilege. I pray for all my web visitors regularly and do love everyone with all my heart. I wish I could only do so much more to help people. I do what I can for God, giving Him all the credit, praise and glory. If there is anything good in me, it is the precious Lord Jesus Christ! Psalms 147:7, “Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; unto our God.” I bought a nice 21 string harp last year, but haven't spent much time with it. I have always loved playing stringed instruments. Lately (in recent months) I have kept busy working on my website ministry, and I've been emotionally down about life in general, so I haven't felt much like playing my music. I go through seasons of depression, and have learned that this is normal for me as a Christian. The Bible tells us how to handle depression in James 5:13, “ Is any among you afflicted? let him pray . Is any merry? let him sing psalms.” When I am sad and down about life, I bunker into the Word of God, work hard on my ministry, focus on soulwinning, and pray my way through the storm, trusting my beautiful all-knowing, all-powerful and all-loving God to see me through, year after year. Lamentations 3:26, “It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.” Isn't that a precious Bible verse!

Lamentations 3:26, “It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.”

There is nothing new under the sun. Just as today, it is human nature to be selfish. God had wonderfully blessed the Hebrews, but they took it all for granted and didn't appreciate what God had done for them. Moses warned the people to beware of forgetting about God in lieu of all His tremendous blessings upon them. God had miraculously parted the Red Sea right in front of them, so that they even walked across on dry ground! Yet the first thing they did when they got to the other side is COMPLAIN that they had no water. This is unbelievable, read it for yourself... Exodus 15:19 and 22 and 24, “For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. ... So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. ... And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? ” I get disgusted just from reading that. Those Hebrew ingrates—who had just witnessed God deliver them from Pharaoh's army, walking across the Red Sea floor on dry ground, then watching Pharaoh's army (men and horses alike) all drown when the waters returned upon them—started complaining just three days later in the Wilderness that they had no water, failing to have faith in the power and love of their great omnipotent God. It is incredibly amazing to me. Moreover, the Jews were warned again and again by Moses the prophet, to stop their complaining, lest it destroy them, but they didn't listen. After complaining for the TENTH TIME, God had finally had enough and banned them from ever entering into the Promised Land. God hates the sin of complaining! HE HATES IT!!! Pastor Jack Hyles preaches a powerful sermon on this very topic about complaining in a sermon titled: “THE HOTTEST HELL OF ALL!” People (whether it be fellow Christians, preachers, family, acquaintances or strangers) are always going to hurt our feelings. They will be inconsiderate, disappoint, let us down, gossip about us, judge us and make us sad if I focus on people—so I live above the clouds where Jesus lives! America has forgotten the God of the Bible. Deuteronomy 6:12, “Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.” So often in life, people receive good at the hand of God, but return nothing in the way of gratitude. In the Old Testament, we learn about a godly man named Job, who made a remarkable statement to his wife when she suggested that he curse God and die. Job 2:10, “But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.” Oh that we would all adopt the godly attitude of Job, who understood (as our text passage from 1st Peter shows) that life includes good and bad. I choose to praise God for the good in my life, and blame the Devil for the bad. It is not God's fault that I have made some stupid and unwise decisions in my life. Blessed be the name of the Lord, for He is faithful, fair and good to all! Psalms 145:9, “The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.” The heathen world is always placing God on trial, but we are the ones who refuse to obey His inspired Words in the Holy Bible. Job 9:3, “If he [man] will contend with him [God], he cannot answer him one of a thousand.” No one can ever blame God (Romans 1:20), for He is faithful. 2nd Timothy 2:13, “If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.” As Ron Hamilton (Patch The Pirate) says, every Christian should have: “THE GRATITUDE ATTITUDE!” Kindly, we are getting what we deserve as a foolish nation for forsaking the God of the Holy Bible. What can we expect from children who have grown up void of the knowledge of God? I read an article today about two 10 year old looking boys who are guilty of a carjacking. To add insult to injury, Freemasons (who control the United States) have introduced the blatant lies of Evolution in all public schools to intentionally lead impressionable children away from God, misleading them to think that they came from a Big Bang, stardust and from the same biological source as gorillas. What can we expect from such abused children? How can we expect children deprived of a God-centered education to exemplify God-like behavior? God is love! To deliberately withhold a God-centered education from a child, and substitute it with a fraudulent system of lies that reduce humanity to the level of animals, is a cruel form of child abuse! The whole scam of the rights of “atheists” not to have to hear the teachings of the Bible in public schools has destroyed the fiber of our society! I don't generally follow the news because it is so depressing, but I have been doing a lot of research for my ministry and reading through crime news lately. I didn't realize how bad things have become in American society. This is the obvious horrifying consequence of removing and banning the inspired Word of God from children's daily lives in public school classrooms since 1963. The Holy Bible has Always Been The Answer! You cannot deny that to the same degree that our country has abandoned the Word of God, to that same degree society is going to the Devil! I have also been watching the Forensic Files, using amazing science to solve horrifying crimes. The evildoer culprits are sometimes police officers, fire investigates, pastors and churchgoers. It is unbelievable what human beings are capable of! Truly the human race is depraved, just as the Holy Bible says. Romans 3:10-11, “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.” The city of Chicago is one of the most dangerous places on earth to live. The following article is just from one weekend... 7 Killed, 46 Wounded In Weekend Shootings; ‘It’s Destroying The Fiber Of Our Communities’ CHICAGO (CBS) — Dozens of people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, including two mass shootings in less than three hours on Sunday. In all, seven people were killed and 46 others were wounded in shootings since Friday evening. More than a dozen people were wounded, one of them fatally, in a pair of mass shootings in the Lawndale neighborhood early Sunday. The first shooting happened around 1:20 a.m. near Roosevelt and Francisco in Douglas Park. Police said a group of people was standing in the park, when someone opened fire from a black Chevrolet Camaro. Seven people were wounded:
• A 21-year-old man shot in the groin was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition;
• A 25-year-old woman shot in the arm and leg was taken to Mount Sinai, where she was stabilized;
• A 20-year-old man shot in the right side was taken to Stroger Hospital, where he was stabilized;
• A 19-year-old woman shot in the right leg was taken to Stroger, where she was stabilized;
• A 22-year-old woman was taken to Mount Sinai, where she was stabilized;
• A 21-year-old man shot in the left leg was taken to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized;
• A 23-year-old man shot in the chest and hand took himself to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized. Less than three hours later, eight people were shot in Lawndale, near 18th and Kildare around 3:45 a.m., when unknown s hooters opened fire on a large group of people at a block party. One man, 33-year-old Demetrius Flowers, was killed, and seven other people were wounded:
• A 35-year-old man shot in the forehead was taken to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized;
• A 28-year-old man shot in the hip was taken to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized;
• A 27-year-old man shot in the foot was taken to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized;
• A 28-year-old man shot in the leg Mount Sinai, where he was treated and released;
• A 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh, and was taken to Stroger, where he was stabilized;
• A 21-year-old woman suffered a graze wound to the thumb, and was treated and released at St. Margaret Hospital;
• A 19-year-old woman was shot in the head, and was taken to Stroger, where she was treated and released. Flowers’ father, said it’s the second son he’s lost to violence. “Please stop. It’s killing our families, it’s destroying the fiber of our communities. We have to stop this senseless killing, because if we don’t, there’s nothing going to be left. There’s nothing going to be left,” Keith Flowers said.

One young man unfortunately murdered over the weekend in Chicago, was 33 year old Demetrius Flowers. His father, Keith Flowers, made the following public statement:

I am not trying to be unkind, God knows my heart, but this father is preaching to the choir. Gang thugs don't care! Keith is making his statement to law-abiding citizens. I noticed in the preceding news story that 90% of the people shot were very young, close to 20 years old. That speaks volumes! Our youth are infested with evil today, because they have been deprived of God's Word in ungodly schools. Luciferians are behind the destruction of America! All high-level Freemasons worship Lucifer, the 99% lower initiates are woefully naive. The same is true of the CIA, U.S. government, Mormonism and other subversive and subverted groups. I am very sorry for Mr. Flowers' loss in the death of his son, and I am not belittling him in any way, God forbid. I am simply pointing out that it is not going to change anything to make statements about how people need to stop shooting each other. Children need the Word of God! 



If you don't allow thoughts of greed to dwell in your mind, then those thoughts cannot fester. No one suddenly goes out and purchases a life insurance policy on their spouse, and then plots to murder them in a clever way to make it look like an accident. Long before such wickedness came into that person's mind, there was already a heart of greed and ungodliness. The major underlying personal theme that I take away from the whole Forensic Files series is the following passage of Scripture from the Holy Bible...

That is the great truth that needs to be engrained into the minds of children, every single day of their school years. If I had my way, every child would recite this passage of Scripture along with their teacher every day, at the beginning of each class, so that it would be so engrained in their soul, that it would be a permanent part of their soul for the rest of their life. Children today don't love God. Their parents who grew up in America's Godless public school system, don't love God. Their grandparents, who grew up in America's ungodly school system after 1963, don't love God. Anyone in the United States today under the age of 74, didn't hear the inspired Word of God read in a public school. That is why crime is epidemic today across the United States, and it can be truthfully said of our culture:

I am going to preach the truth until I can no longer do so—THE KING JAMES BIBLE IS THE ANSWER!!!!!!!

Everyone who is guilty of hurting another human being, to provide the heinous crime to make another episode of Forensic Files, failed to heed the Bible's command to LOVE GOD and LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR! The two greatest commandments in the Word of God are to LOVE GOD, and LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR. Don't ever forget that truth and you won't go astray! As Brother Lester Roloff (1914-1982) said—these two commandments are really just one—TO LOVE! If we fall in love with our Maker, and allow God to love us, and allow God to love our fellow man through us, then we will never intentionally harm another human being. Amen! I sure hope somebody is listening.

Every Christian believer needs to be on-guard against sin continually, because anyone is capable of committing the worst sins under the right circumstances. That is what I mean by my article title: “Love, Forgive, Help, Work And Pray.” No one is above sin! NO ONE! The Bible admonishes us to take heed if we are misled to think we are doing okay, because we could commit an unthinkable crime just like the criminals we read about. Every criminal at one time was a law-abiding citizen! Proverbs 4:23, “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” That Bible verse means to deal with the small sinful thoughts in your mind, before they grow into evil behavior! I want to think right, do right, and live right, to please God and stay out of trouble. I want to: “Love, Forgive, Help, Work And Pray.” If you maintain that godly attitude—of always loving others, and forgiving everyone, and helping everyone, and working honestly to stay busy, and praying for God's power and protection from evil—you will joyously prosper in the Christian life. There is no joy like knowing you are right with God and man. I want to live in such a way that no one can justly accuse me of doing evil. ...

Quite often, I have web visitors confide in me that they are struggling with the sins of lust, hatred, pornography, pride, rebellion, et cetera. I always try to help them in a spirit of meekness. Galatians 6:1, “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.” The Bible teaches us in 2nd Corinthians 10:5, “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” Here we learn how to live right! When a sinful thought enters into our mind, we are supposed to CAST DOWN THAT THOUGHT with the inspired Word of God (i.e., the King James Bible). By doing that, you prevent the Devil from filling your heart to do evil.

I refuse to have a garbage pail for a mind. Anyone can choose to live right! In the Old Testament, Job was a godly man who purposed in his heart to think and live right. Job 31:1, “I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?” I receive e-mails from young men who are struggling with lust and pornography. That is a very dangerous vice! The way to handle it is to take control of your thought-life and abstain from fleshly lusts. 1st Peter 2:11, “Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.” The Bible commands men to abstain from the lusts of the flesh. To look at filthy images is a CHOICE! Until you start making the right choices, you'll never gain victory over any sin. Each time you make the wrong sinful choice, it makes it a little easier to make another sinful choice, until you turn evil, and eventually you'll be the next episode of Forensic Files! Behind every tragedy in human character is a slow process of wicked thinking! 



Christians Are Pilgrims Not Settlers On Earth

It is important for every believer to embrace the mindset that this temporary world is not our home. Don't get too comfortable down here. Brother Lester Roloff (1914-1982) preached a wonderful sermon titled: “Don't Get Adjusted,” in which sermon he makes the truthful statement: “YOU LOSE OUT WHEN YOU GET ADJUSTED DOWN HERE!” I hate this wicked world! I am so sick and tired of the sin, the filth, and the ungodly transgendered homosexual agenda that is as a disease upon society today, sick of it all!!! Even so, come, Lord Jesus!!! Heaven is our home where we will ultimately settle (John 14:1-3). The heathen world places all emphasis on this earthly life, living for the moment with no thought of facing the Eternal God someday. As believers, we are commanded to—“Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:2-3). Oh, how Christians fail to follow the Lord's instruction in the Scriptures! When believers fret and worry and complain and focus on making money, “they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection” (Luke 8:14). Carnal believers aren't soulwinners!

All we hear about nowadays is that everyone should accept and respect the rights of homosexuals. The heart of the matter is God. What does God think? What does God say in His Holy Word? You've got the righteous speaking out against the evils of homosexuality, as the Bible tells us to do. Ephesians 5:10-12, “Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.” A man sodomizing another man's anus is a work of darkness! I am grossed out and sickened when I hear pastors of churches legitimizing the LGBTQ community, such as did Southern Baptist Convention president J.D. Greear. Proverbs 29:27, “An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.”

Kindly, I heard Tim Cook, the present CEO of Apple computer say publicly: “Being gay is God's greatest gift to me.” God calls Tim Cook a liar! Proverbs 28:9, “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.” Leviticus 20:13, “If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.” We are living in extremely wicked times, in which ungodly reprobates are elevating their own ungodly human lusts over the inspired Words of God. That is so wrong! Judges 21:25, “In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.” The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that a human being in a mother's womb is not yet a life, so it can be killed. God calls it murder (Exodus 20:13). ABORTION: HANDS THAT SHED INNOCENT BLOOD!!! It is hard to even imagine how a society could ever become so ungodly, uncaring, indifferent, calloused and far from God, that their leaders could justify murdering human life. And now in many states infanticide is legal, where a child is murdered while being delivered, and in Illinois, after leaving the womb. Ungodly State Of Illinois Declares Open Season On Children: Removes All Bans On Abortions! 



2nd Timothy 3:12, “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” I am going to quote a rather lengthy passage from 1st Peter, to help you see the full context of what the apostle Peter is teaching us. The Bible teaches that when a Christian separates from their old life of sin, and from their old worldly acquaintances, they will think it strange, criticizing us and persecuting us in many cases. ...

The Bible admonishes Christians not to be surprised that worldly people hate us, persecute us and separate from us over our faith and stand for Christ. Jesus said in John 15:19 that if we were of the world, they would receive us; but because we are not of the world, we are followers of Christ our Savior, the world hates us. John 7:7 says they really hate Jesus, and that they see Christ in us. The world hates Jesus Christ!!!



 In Everything Gives Thanks!

Jesus miraculously healed ten men afflicted with the horrible incurable disease of leprosy. Today there is a cure for leprosy, since the 1940's, but in Bible times there wasn't and it was a much feared disease. Unbelievably, only one man had enough gratitude to come back to thank the Lord. Luke 17:17, “And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?” There are 86,400 seconds in each day, have you thanked God even once today for His abundant blessings? We ought to thank God continually for our food, comforts, family, salvation, the Holy Bible and manifold gifts that most people take for granted. James 1:17, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” Every good thing in your life comes from God, whether you acknowledge that fact or not. And also, within God's permissive will, everything bad that happens in our lives is allowed by God, which is a difficult truth to embrace. We live in a fallen world because of sin, beginning with Adam (Romans 5:12). When Adam chose to sin, he opened the floodgate of sin and death upon the world. This is why bad things happen to good people, and good things happen to bad people, and life is not fair!

Christians ought to be mindful of our blessings, especially in America where we have been blessed beyond all expectations compared to most of the impoverished world. Just the privilege and opportunity to go out to eat, in a fancy restaurants like Chilies or Burger King (that's fine dining to me), is something that most people living in the world cannot enjoy. We take so much for granted in America. We are so spoiled. It is a crying shame and the epitome of utter ingratitude—that amidst all these incredible blessings, liberty and modern comforts from God—that Americans are sinfully steeped into sexual immorality, 60 million children murdered by abortion, homosexuals marriages and all manner of filth, evil and wickedness!!! God deserves so much better, but Americans treat Him like garbage! We really do as a people! How do you think God feels that we have allowed our government to remove and ban the Holy Bible from children's lives? Honestly, so you have any idea how detrimental that has been to our nation? The Bible is the Sacred Book, the only Book in existence that teaches mankind to LOVE, yet hateful and ungodly reprobates have used stupid excuses to rid children of the only chance they have of growing up to become a loving human being! 



I suffer in constant chronic neck pain. My wife divorced me against my will in 2006, and I have lived alone ever since in the Lord (1st Corinthians 7:27). I have forgiven her completely, but as Dr. Jack Hyles wisely said: Divorce is a sin that perpetuates for a lifetime. I lost well over $100,000 as a result of the divorce. I lost my home after the divorce and have rented since. I lost my retirement. I lost my pets. I lost most of my possessions. I could go on and on for hours describing all the pain, loss, suffering and heartache in my life over the past 20 years. Pastor John K. Jenkins Sr. exposes the evils of divorce in his excellent sermon titled: The Devastating Demon That Destroys Families. I am as much a sinner as my former wife, so I do not point fingers. There are no perfect marriages. God says when you marry someone, you become one with them, so as far as I'm concerned her sins throughout our marriage were my sins too. WE HAVE SINNED!

Albeit, despite my misery, problems, pain and broken heart, I have the joy of the Lord in my soul. I have peace like a river. Isaiah 26:3, “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee .” I love that Bible verse! That is a solemn promise from our great God. The Lord promises perfect peace to the believer whose mind dwells and remains upon God. Psalms 1:1-2, “Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night .” The Bible says the reason why we have perfect peace is because we trust the Lord. Perfect peace comes from trusting God in everything! I choose to love, forgive, help, work and pray in the Lord, instead of worry, complain, hate harbor bitterness and place God on trial. I am going to continue to trust the Lord, though He slay me. Job 13:15, “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.” I am going to love everybody. I choose to forgive everyone even before they ask. I am trying by God's grace to help as many people as I can. I labor night and day for the Lord. I pray because Jesus said without Him we can do nothing (John 15:5). I need God's help in everything I do. Galatians 2:20, “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”

Everywhere I go today, I meet people who have contempt for Christians, churches and the Holy Bible, but they claim to love God. They are deceived. Nobody loves God who despises the King James Bible! Although many churches are corrupt, THE CHURCH has never been (nor ever could be) corrupted. Likewise, the INCORRUPTIBLE WORDS OF GOD cannot be corrupted (1st Peter 1:23). The corrupted modern Bible versions are NOT God's inspired Words. You can change the truth of God into a lie all you want (Romans 1:25), but you cannot change THE TRUTH! ...

Listen to me dear reader, whatever your hang up may be—whether it be struggling with sin, religious scrupulosity, finding God's will, depression or confusion—get into the Scriptures and you will grow! 1st Timothy 4:13-15, “Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all .” When somebody tells me that they are struggling with sin, I always point them toward the Holy Bible. Psalms 119:9, “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.” You cannot heed God's Word if you are not familiar with the contents of God's Word. SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES!!!

Dear friend, The Holy Bible Has Always Been The Answer. Would to God that we still had that kind of wisdom today in leadership. I have been watching the Forensic Files, and in nearly every case of a person being convicted of First Degree Murder, the state refuses to use capital punishment. That is the sordid wisdom of this foolish and ungodly world. I am 100% for capital punishment, because that is God's wisdom. Please read: “THE CASE FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: HOW IT SAVED MY LIFE” (a needful doctrinally sound book by Dr. Max D. Younce). The foolish world never comes to their senses! 2nd Timothy 3:7, “Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.” The newsmedia reports the problem. Career professionals study the problem. Talk shows exploit the problem. Government legislates the problem. Police control the problem. HUMANITY IS THE PROBLEM!

I thank God for His precious inspired Word in the King James Bible, which is our Lamp. Psalms:119:105, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Humanity is the problem, because of our inherent sinful nature. The answer is the 'GOOD NEWS' (GOSPEL) of the Lord Jesus Christ crucified on the cross for our sins, buried and bodily resurrected the third day for our justification! John 6:47, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.”

32,1319,"By means of a finite element algorithm we investigate the effects of lateral viscosity variations upon the horizontal motions currently detected by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) in Europe. Our approach is based on a suite of flat Earth models including a layered compressible Maxwell mantle and regions of anomalous viscosity localized both in the lithosphere and in the upper mantle. A detailed study of horizontal velocities expected in the periphery of the Fennoscandia ice-sheet is followed by a comparison between VLBI data and model predictions. Our results show that the rates of horizontal deformations are greatly sensitive to both lateral viscosity variations and deep mantle stratification, especially close to the margins of the ice sheet. We have found that among the Earth models studied here, those including both lateral variations and a sharp increase of mantle viscosity across upper and lower mantle are the most suitable to ‘explain’ the rates of horizontal velocity currently observed in Europe.",mainstream,M12297,flat.earth

1,921,"Despite concerns by some parents that their children receive “too many vaccines too soon,” a new study finds that many shots, even on the same day, do not increase the risk of autism.

In the first six months of life, children receive as many as 19 vaccine doses of six different vaccines, and by the time they are 6 years old, a total of 25 doses from 10 vaccines.

MORE FROM MY HEALTH NEWS DAILY:
• Beyond Vaccines: 5 Things that Might Really Cause Autism
• 10 Medical Myths that Just Won't Go Away

In a 2011 survey, about a third of parents expressed concerns that their child received too many vaccines before age 2, and too many vaccines on a single day.

Previous studies have found no link between the number of vaccines a child receives and their risk of several neurological conditions (though these studies did not specifically consider autism).

The new study went a step further by looking at the link between a child's total exposure to antigens — the proteins in vaccines that stimulate the body's immune system — and his or her risk of autism.

The researchers looked at total antigen exposure rather than the total number of vaccines kids received because, at the root of parents' concerns is the idea that ""somehow they provide too much immunological stimulation, more so than a young child's immune system can handle,"" said study researcher Dr. Frank DeStefano, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The sheer number of vaccines would not be as good a measure of immunological response because vaccines contain different numbers of antigens, and some protect against more than one disease, DeStefano said.)

DeStefano and colleagues analyzed information from about 250 children with autism and 750 children without autism, born between 1994 and 1999.

Children with autism were exposed to about same total number of antigens as children without autism at ages 3 months, 7 months and 2 years. There was also no difference between the two groups in terms of the total number of antigens they were exposed to on a single day.

""Parental concerns that their children are receiving too many vaccines in the first two years of life, or too many vaccines at a single doctor visit are not supported in terms of an increased risk of autism,"" the researchers write in the March 29 issue of the Journal of Pediatrics.

Kids are exposed to many viruses and other pathogens that stimulate their immune systems in the same way vaccines do, and it's been estimated that kids could theoretically receive thousands of vaccines at once, the researchers said.

Although children today receive more vaccines than children in the mid-90s, the vaccines used today contain fewer antigens. So while children in the mid-90s were exposed to between 3,000 and 15,250 antigens in the first two years of life, children today are exposed to about 315 antigens, the researchers said.

2,534,"On April 30, the nation reported just four cases, all of them travellers arriving from abroad, marking the first day with zero local infections in two and a half months. As case numbers have continued to fall, the government has cautiously relaxed its guidelines, while signaling a shift to ""everyday quarantine"" measures, such as wearing masks and temperature checks at schools.

People's attitudes have also relaxed, leading some officials to worry about complacency and a second wave of infections. The nightclub outbreak may heighten those fears, but the government has already responded aggressively, tracing and testing thousands of people in a matter of days.

Last mile is the toughest

Though testing companies were quick to respond to the demand, rolling out the kits presented difficulties. Through February, demand for tests was still outpacing supply, and there were only enough kits to distribute to a select number of hospitals.

Furthermore, hospitals struggled to administer the tests to potentially contagious patients safely and quickly—testing areas needed to be sanitised after each patient, long queues meant the virus could spread while people waited in line, and health workers were running low on protective gear. At Yangji Hospital, this also led to exhausted staff, says hospital director Sang Il Kim.

""Even when we did have kits, the waiting times were just too long for everybody to get tested, so they would have to go to other hospitals,"" adds Yoona Chung, a doctor in the hospital's surgery department.

According to Yangji's data, the hospital was conducting roughly 10 tests a day by late February—but many more were being turned away due to the wait. Other hospitals in Korea started experimenting with drive-through testing centres, where patients could get tested without leaving their cars. But Yangji Hospital is near a subway station in a crowded neighbourhood in southern Seoul; for many of its patients, cars aren't an option.

So, Kim devised the walk-in booths, which went into pilot operation on March 10. Within days, the number of tests administered in a day had tripled. By the end of the month, the hospital could handle more than 90 patients a day. Hospitals elsewhere in Korea and around the world quickly adopted their own variations on the concept. A hospital in Busan had a similar idea independently but others have had help from Kim.",mainstream,M08f39,cancer; coronavirus; covid.19; drug.companies; population.control; vaccine.covid
3,538,"The FBI disproved its main theory about how the anthrax spores were weaponized.

The investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks ended as far as the public knew on July 29, 2008, with the death of Bruce Ivins, a senior biodefense researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Md. The cause of death was an overdose of the painkiller Tylenol. No autopsy was performed, and there was no suicide note.

Less than a week after his apparent suicide, the FBI declared Ivins to have been the sole perpetrator of the 2001 Anthrax attacks, and the person who mailed deadly anthrax spores to NBC, the New York Post, and Sens. Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy. These attacks killed five people, closed down a Senate office building, caused a national panic, and nearly paralyzed the postal system.

The FBI’s six-year investigation was the largest inquest in its history, involving 9,000 interviews, 6,000 subpoenas, and the examination of tens of thousands of photocopiers, typewriters, computers and mailboxes. Yet it failed to find a shred of evidence that identified the anthrax killer–or even a witness to the mailings. With the help of a task force of scientists, it found a flask of anthrax that closely matched–through its genetic markers–the anthrax used in the attack.

This flask had been in the custody of Ivins, who had published no fewer than 44 scientific papers over three decades as a microbiologist and who was working on developing vaccines against anthrax. As custodian, he provided samples of it to other scientists at Fort Detrick, the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, and other facilities involved in anthrax research.

According to the FBI’s reckoning, over 100 scientists had been given access to it. Any of these scientists (or their co-workers) could have stolen a minute quantity of this anthrax and, by mixing it into a media of water and nutrients, used it to grow enough spores to launch the anthrax attacks.",conspiracy,C0086a,vaccine
4,192,"A shot in the dark? Some say flu vaccine hard to find

Some parts of the country are experiencing spot shortages of flu vaccine because of increased demand in a flu season that started earlier and is more severe than previous years.

In Las Vegas, Celeste Tom tried six times before she found a flu shot for her boyfriend.

""I'd been bugging him to get a flu shot, but he kept putting it off,"" said Tom, 55. The Smith's Food and Drug Center where she got her shot was out. Her partner called his doctor's office, but they were out, too. Next she tried a Walgreens and then a CVS pharmacy; no vaccine. She called another Smith's, but it would administer vaccine only to people over 65. On Monday, she found a Walgreens that had 10 doses left. ""I called back when he got off work at 1 p.m. to make sure they still had some, and he finally went in.""

""The bottom line is there's vaccine out there,"" said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""There may be places where there are spot shortages, but there should be a little bit more coming, so people may have to check around for it.""

It took Pam Copley a full day. The Staten Island, N.Y., mom, 42, tried her pediatrician, but the office had no appointments until February. She and daughter Colleen, 15, got in line at a CVS, only to have the nurse come and and say she didn't have shots for anyone under 18. After ""a bunch of phone calls,"" Copley found vaccine at an urgent-care clinic. They had to wait there for five hours, but it was worth it, she said. ""There's lots of flu in the schools here right now.

U.S. flu vaccine manufacturers have increased the number of doses they expect to produce this year to 145 million from previous estimates of 137 million, Skinner said. About 128 million doses have been shipped, and the ""vast majority"" of those have been used, he said. ""We had 112 million people vaccinated by the end of November.""

The CDC is working with the National Influenza Vaccine Summit, a coalition that monitors the flu and vaccine supply, to tell doctors and other health care providers which distributors and vaccine manufacturers have vaccine available to order, Skinner said.

""Spot shortages are not due to any manufacturing issues,"" said Rita Chappelle, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration. It's more an effect of a mild flu season last year and a more severe one this year. ""Demand for the vaccine is high.""

Ordering flu vaccine can be a challenge, said Cameron Wolfe with the division of infectious diseases at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, N.C. It requires ""pharmacies, physicians' offices and clinics to pre-order their supply, and given the variability in the flu season, it is always an educated estimate of what you'll actually need.""

There are two main vaccine producers in the United States, Sanofi US in Bridgewater, Conn., and GlaxoSmithKline in Upper Merion, Pa. For the 2012-2013 flu season GlaxoSmithKline, also known as GSK, produced about 25 million doses of flu vaccine.

All those 25 million doses of flu vaccine are spoken for, and shipping will be finished by early to mid-February, GSK spokesman Robert Perry said.

That doesn't mean there's no more flu vaccine available to doctors. Much of GSK's production goes to medical suppliers that take orders from doctors' offices, Perry said. The company had the capacity to produce more flu shots, but 25 million doses was ""what customers told us they would need,"" Perry said. In the past two years about half of Americans get vaccinated.

It's tricky to estimate how much to produce because flu vaccine takes six to nine months to produce, so manufacturers have to plan production before all the orders are in. GSK began taking orders for this flu season in October 2011. It will finish taking orders for next year's flu season next month. Health care providers base their estimates on previous year's demand. A single dose costs $7.90 to $8.85 wholesale, and doctors are careful not to order too much.

It's still not too late to get vaccinated. Flu seasons are unpredictable in their length, and it's unclear whether cases are still building or beginning to wane, according to the CDC. ""Being vaccinated with the flu vaccine each year remains the best way to prevent the flu,"" Chappelle said.

6,427,"Jeff Bradstreet, who has been described as a “controversial autism researcher,” has now become the center of conspiracy rumors after reports of his apparent suicide. His death is said to have followed on the heels of a raid by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of his Bradstreet Wellness Center in Buford, Georgia (update 27JUN2015: the Georgia Drugs and Narcotics Agency is reported to have aided in the raid). A fisherman found Bradstreet’s body in a North Carolina river on Friday, June 19. Authorities in Rutherford County, North Carolina, state that he had a gunshot wound to the chest, “which appears to be self-inflicted,” according to the local newspaper, the Gwinnett Daily Post. The Post also reports that

That speculation has spread like a virus through the community of people who are mourning the loss of a man whom they viewed as a courageous crusader against mainstream medicine and who believe, as Bradstreet argued, that the mercury in vaccines causes autism (the evidence emphatically indicates otherwise). According to his website, Bradstreet, whose own son is autistic, embraced a number of unproven or untested interventions for autism, including using stem cells in an overseas study he chronicles, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which the FDA cracked down on in 2013. He was known for his use of chelation therapy.

As I’ve written about here before, those who are attracted to conspiracy theories to explain their world have a tendency to see conspiracy all around them. With the death of Bradstreet, this tendency is emerging in force. A related fundraiser with the title “Finding out the truth” references an “exhaustive investigation into the possibility of foul play.” At last look, the funds raised were in the low five figures. Some seem to think that the location of the wound suggests foul play, but about a fifth of suicides by gunshot involve a wound to the chest. A handgun also was found in the river where Bradstreet’s body was discovered.

Studies of people who are prone to subscribe to conspiracy theories indicate that readers drawn to conspiracy-related online news tend to be more focused on what filters into their narrow, conspiracy-oriented communities, reinforcing confirmation biases and adding fuel to the conspiratorial machine. In the US, “conspiracist beliefs,” which are widespread, correlate with being more likely to use alternative medicine and to shun mainstream medicine, even to the point of being less likely to have an annual physical. Researchers call the internet a “natural medium” for the diffusion of conspiracy theories, and the rapidity with which this one spread and took hold is no exception.",mainstream,M08c0c,vaccine.autism
7,591,"by Ashley AustrewPoliticians aren’t exactly known for being honest. President Nixon had the Watergate scandal. President Bill Clinton lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And, in the first two years Donald Trump was president, the Washington Post reported he’s made over 8,000 “false or misleading claims” to the American public.

Still, it is rare to see a headline declaring any president or politician a liar. Why is that?

First of all, what does it mean to lie?

The noun and verb lie are both recorded in Old English by the 900s. To lie is “to speak falsely or utter truth knowingly, as with intent to deceive.” More generally, to lie is “to express what is false, convey a false impression.”

So, when a person lies, they aren’t just sharing false information, they’re doing it with the sinister intent of getting others to believe misleading information. If someone does this habitually, then we would call them a liar, “a person who tells lies.” This word is also attested to in the 900s.

Why don’t journalists use the word liar?

The main reason why many journalists avoid accusations of lying is because it is difficult to determine one key word in that definition above: intent.

If a lie is “a false statement that is made with deliberate intent to deceive,” then calling someone a liar means you know they are intentionally trying to mislead people. While many of us make that assumption about politicians, it’s different when you’re a member of the media tasked with reporting the news—not your own conclusions about it.

David Greenberg, a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers University and a contributing editor at Politico, wrote in 2017 that the media declaring the president a liar would cross a serious line. That’s not to say that it should never be done.

Prior to the Watergate scandal, as Greenberg observed, a National Press Club report found Nixon guilty of “an unprecedented, government-wide effort to control, restrict and conceal information” and “discredit the press.” Still, it wasn’t until the Watergate story broke and investigations proved Nixon’s intent that the media declared the president a liar. If the media wants to retain their credibility, Greenberg argued, they are right to hold back from declaring President Trump, or anyone else, a liar. “Though it may seem fainthearted to use words like ‘falsehood’ and ‘untruth,’ in the long run the press will have more influence if it avoids insinuating more than it can confidently assert to be true,” he wrote.

Should journalists use liar anyways?

On January 21, 2019, the Washington Post reported that, in the first two years of his presidency alone, Trump made 8,158 false claims about the economy, immigration, trade, foreign policy, and other matters.

In just one instance in March 2019, Trump wrongly identified Patrick Moore, a man with early involvement in Greenpeace, as a cofounder of the organization in a tweet about him calling climate change “fake news.” Greenpeace was quick to correct Trump on the fact that Moore was not a cofounder, but that didn’t change the fact that many people were exposed to the tweet and may have accepted the president’s words as true.

Since the 2016 US presidential election, people have grown increasingly frustrated with the media’s treatment of public figures who lie, with many concerned that we live in a post-truth society where facts have become irrelevant.

And, it’s not only Trump. That election brought us the Hillary Clinton email scandal, during which Clinton said she “never received nor sent any material that was marked classified” on her private email server as Secretary of State—a claim that Politifact characterized as false.

During the 2016 presidential election, Politifact also found that 84 percent of claims Ben Carson, now Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made since 2007 were false, including his assertion that there are a “multitude” of unnecessary vaccines available to the public. Texas Senator Ted Cruz told lies about 66 percent of the time in that time frame, including that “the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls.”

Blurring the lines between fact and fiction even more, Trump has popularized the term fake news—not to call out actual fake news but to discredit anyone or anything perceived as unflattering to him. That strategy has been incredibly effective, and he has succeeded in creating an environment in which the truth is difficult to discern.

Many argue that the media simply can’t tolerate this level of misinformation anymore. Even journalists are starting to call one another out.

In January, Esquire published an op-ed by journalist Dan Sinker called “In 2019, The Media Has to Do Better in Calling Out Trump’s Sh*t [edited].” Sinker noted that journalists don’t use words like lie and liar because they’re supposed to maintain a level of objectivity. Nonetheless, he added:Of course, being objective doesn’t mean letting liars lie. “Balance” isn’t setting two pundits up to argue over what everyone knows is a false statement. There’s no bias in saying something is patently untrue if it is, in fact, patently untrue. In fact, saying things aren’t true from jump is kinda the most important part of the job.Some major news organizations have indeed been using the word liar in content. In August 2018, The New Yorker ran the headline “It’s True: Trump Is Lying More & He’s Doing It On Purpose.” In October, CNN published “Donald Trump Lies And He’s Doing A Lot More of It Lately.” The Atlantic joined the call-out in November 2018 with a piece simply titled: “The President’s Lies.”

In the era of fake news, publications have to contend with the fact that any escalation on their part (i.e., calling someone a liar), also comes with an escalation in the intense scrutiny the media is already facing. The media has the unique ability to speak truth to power, and that includes calling out politicians and not allowing them to get away with lies.

There may be disagreement on where the liar line should be, but that doesn’t change the fact that we need to draw one—even if intent is tricky to determine.

8,948,"It's midday at a busy pediatrician's surgery in Karlsruhe, a mid-sized town in the southwest German state of Baden-Württemberg.

A mother carries her sleeping child into the waiting room, while a sick baby screams so loudly that the receptionist has difficulty making herself understood on the phone.

Over in a corner, an assistant is preparing a combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccination for the next patient.

She carefully puts a needle and a syringe on a tray together some medical swabs, and then removes the vaccine from the fridge. It still needs to be drawn and diluted before being injected.

The World Health Organization recommends that all children have two doses of the vaccine to ensure immunity from measles.

""All of my children have been vaccinated against measles,"" says Dr Dieter Knöbl from behind his desk.

Dr Knöbl, one of three pediatricians who work here, has been treating children in this surgery for 20 years. Before that he spent 14 years on the pediatric ward of the Karlsruhe public hospital.

He says he's seen so ""many children suffering from measles and many from measles complications"" that he always advises parents to vaccinate.

The measles complications Dr Knöbl is talking about include middle ear infections, pneumonia and measles encephalitis. The latter is an inflammation of the brain, which can cause permanent brain damage and even death.

Another complication is the quite rare but fatal disease with the unwieldy name of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). With SSPE, the virus slowly attacks the central nervous system.

""It's as if the children have Alzheimer's even though they are young,"" Knöbl says.

""As the disease progresses the infected children physically and mentally deteriorate. They can't speak, they are paralyzed and at the end, they just lie there and gasp for air. It is a wretched death.""

During his time working at the hospital, Dr Knöbl experienced three children dying of SSPE and one of pneumonia.

Measles complications are more common than many people think.

Of the nearly three hundred people who caught measles in an outbreak in Berlin in 2013, more than a hundred ended up in hospital - that's a hospitalization rate of more than 30 percent.

On average, one in a thousand measles patients will develop encephalitis. In western countries, about one in three thousand people infected with measles will die (the figure is much higher in developing countries, where added factors, such as malnutrition, can result in measles fatality rates of up to 30 percent).

To make matters worse, measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet.

But many refuse to vaccinate

Despite the risks, there are many parents who refuse to have their children vaccinated.

Some doctor's surgeries in Germany refuse to take on children who haven't had all their jabs, saying it's the only way to protect their other patients.

""That isn't our philosophy,"" says Dr Knöbl.

He and his colleagues believe that by turning away unvaccinated children the parents may deliberately seek out doctors who share their opposition to vaccination.

By keeping the parents coming to his surgery, he hopes there is a chance the doctors can win them over.

""In our experience, the younger the child, the more worried the parents are about vaccinating,"" Dr Knöbl says. ""But if you accept their fears and give them a bit of time, most of them change their mind.""

In 1998, the British medical doctor Andrew Wakefield alleged the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine caused autism.

Although Wakefield's study has since been discredited and withdrawn - and Wakefield has been struck off as a British medical practitioner - rumors of the link continue to abound.

In addition, there are parents who are unwilling to risk their children getting encephalitis, which is a rare side-effect of the vaccine.

At around a chance of one-in-a-million, the risk is considerably less than the one-in-a-thousand chance of developing encephalitis from measles itself.

But add these fears to the general public distrust of doctors, medicines and pharmaceutical companies - which is more pronounced in the southern German states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria - together with those who simply forget to bring their child for a follow-up jab and you have a significant number of children who aren't immunized.

In Germany, the measles immunization rate is 92 percent - in Baden-Württemberg it's even lower at 89 percent. This might sound like a lot, but it is well below the 95 percent goal set by Germany and other European nations to eradicate the disease by 2015.

In 2013, the then German health minister Daniel Bahr raised the idea of mandatory vaccination as a way of increasing the measles vaccination rate.

But Dr Günter Pfaff, the chief epidemiologist at the Baden-Württemberg State Health Authority isn't convinced that such measures would work in Germany.

""We probably would have to use more energy to fight against opposition to mandatory vaccination than we could use to convince people that vaccination is good, and that it would be a benefit for their children,"" he says from his office in Stuttgart.

For Pfaff, defeating measles in Germany is about minutely analyzing the data.

He turns around a giant whiteboard covered with a map of the state. It shows the measles vaccination rate for every health district. Some are dark blue - that's good because it means the vaccination rate is more than 95 percent. Others are light blue - which isn't so good.

""You can see there are a few communities, where there is quite a stark contrast between [them and] neighboring communities, and there is hardly another way of explaining this than that the practice of provision of medical services varies from town to town,"" he says.

One approach the state health authority (Landesgesundheitsamt Baden-Württemberg) is looking into is directly approaching doctors in villages and towns with low vaccination rates. It is something Dr Pfaff has tried in a few cases.

""What we [want to do] is ask the doctors 'did you notice that in your town vaccinations are much lower than in the neighboring village? And how come? We would like to draw your attention to this and we would like to talk to you about it,'"" he says.

Another approach they have been using is publishing the measles vaccination rates for villages and districts in community newsletters along with comparisons to neighboring places.

This kind of specific, local information has been found to help more than public information campaigns on a national level or in mainstream, national media.

Whatever the approach, it is possible to eradicate measles.

9,941,"Measles, also called rubeola, is a viral infection that's one of the most contagious infectious diseases in the world. The disease is marked by symptoms that are similar to a common cold, as well as a characteristic red rash.

Less than two decades ago, measles was almost wiped out in the United States, thanks to vaccines.

But recently, the virus has had a resurgence. Globally, the number of cases has jumped 30% due to vaccine hesitancy. More than 760 cases of measles were reported in the U.S. between Jan. 1 and May 3, 2019, according to Dr. Deepa Mukundan, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the University of Toledo Medical Center in Ohio. This is up from 372 cases over the entire year in 2018 and up from 120 cases over the entire year in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

How contagious is it?

Measles is caused by Measles morbillivirus, a virus in the paramyxoviridae family. According to the CDC, the measles virus settles in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. When a person infected with the virus coughs, sneezes or exhales, the virus becomes airborne and can spread to other people.

""The virus can remain in the air for significant periods of time,"" Mukundan told Live Science. ""One can get the measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, even up to 2 hours after that person has left.""

Indeed, the virus is incredibly contagious — 90% of people who are not vaccinated against measles will become infected if they share space with someone who has the virus.

""Another reason that it is transmitted so effectively is because the hallmark of measles, the rash, only comes several days after someone is contagious,"" said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at New York University Langone Health. Therefore, infected individuals can spread the virus for several days before realizing they're ill. The contagious period lasts about four days before and four days after the rash appears.

A person with measles is likely to infect between 5 and 18 unvaccinated people, according to a 2019 review published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Most cases of measles cause some combination of cough, runny nose, red eyes, high fever and tiny white to bluish spots in the mouth, said Dr. Aileen M. Marty, a professor of infectious diseases at Florida International University's Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in Miami. As the infection progresses, the characteristic red rash will develop. The rash typically looks like large, red, flat splotches on the skin.

To test for measles, a doctor will examine the patient for telltale symptoms, such as spots inside of the mouth and the skin rash. If the doctor has any doubt, they may order a blood test to confirm infection, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Almost all cases require treatment by a doctor. ""This is a disease where complications are common — complications such as ear infection (acute otitis media), diarrhea and dehydration, pneumonia, encephalitis and even death,"" Marty told Live Science. ""In the United States, one to three of every 1,000 infected persons will die from [measles] complications — which is better than in the Third World, where as many as two to 15 per 100 infected persons die from measles and its complications.""

Young children are much more susceptible to the virus. According to the Mayo Clinic, measles kills 100,000 people a year, most under the age of 5. Pregnant women and those with a compromised immune system are also at risk of severe complications.

There is no specific drug for treating measles. Instead, doctors treat the symptoms. ""This means we provide/advise hydration, antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) for comfort and fever control, airway humidification in patients with respiratory tract involvement,"" Marty said. Though not licensed in the United States for the treatment of measles, some pediatricians have used Ribavirin, an antiviral medication, to treat severe pneumonia caused by measles, Marty added.

To protect those who have been exposed to the virus but have not been vaccinated, a doctor may order a post-exposure vaccination. If given within 72 hours of exposure, the vaccination may prevent the measles. Even if it doesn't prevent the disease, the vaccinated patient will only have a mild case of the measles, according to the Mayo Clinic. Another way to protect at-risk individuals is to inject them with immune serum globulin (antibodies or proteins derived from the blood of donors with measles immunity) within six days of exposure to the virus. Like a vaccination, this treatment can prevent measles or make the onset less severe.

For many people, recovering from the measles includes resting at home until the symptoms subside. It is important for patients to drink plenty of fluids to replace fluids lost during fevers. It may also be helpful to use a humidifier to relieve congestion and to block out bright lights that may bother sensitive eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic. Once the disease has run its course, the person will be immune to the virus.

However, the immune system may be significantly weakened for up to 2 years after recovering from the measles, according to Lighter. During this time, people can be more susceptible to secondary viral and bacterial infections, which may cause more complications than the original measles infection.

The best way to prevent measles is by vaccination. The CDC recommends 2 doses of the vaccine; the first for those between 12 and 15 months of age and the second for children between 4 and 6 years of age. The vaccine is 97% effective for those who receive both doses and about 93% effective for those receiving one.

Getting the proper vaccinations not only protects the individual receiving the vaccine, it also protects those who cannot be vaccinated: those allergic to components of the vaccine, those with a compromised immune system or those too young to receive the vaccine.

""Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have to protect public health and prevent deaths around the world,"" said Dr. Scott Lillibridge, an infectious disease expert and professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health.

About 94% of the U.S. population is vaccinated against measles, according to Mukundan, although there are pockets of people who delay or refuse vaccines. The groups of unvaccinated people make it difficult to control the spread of measles, she said.

""All measles outbreaks in the U.S. start either with a visiting international traveler infected with measles or from an unvaccinated U.S. resident returning from an international trip with a measles infection,"" Mukundan said. The infection is then spread to others in the community who are unvaccinated.

Most measles cases occur in locations with groups of unvaccinated individuals, according to the CDC. In 2000, the U.S. declared that measles was effectively eliminated in the country. But since then, the disease has been making a comeback, likely due to anti-vaxxers.

""The antivax movement is a small percentage of the population but they are loud and draw a lot of undue media attention,"" Lighter said. Anti-vaxxers are driven by emotion rather than the science behind the vaccines, she said.

Modern opposition to vaccines is largely fueled by religious beliefs and the unwarranted concern that vaccines are somehow linked to autism, among other reasons, according to the Measles & Rubella Initiative, a collaboration of the world's largest health organizations that aims to eliminate measles and rubella.

Before the measles vaccine approval in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people in the U.S. contracted the measles per year, with 400 to 500 dying from complications, according to the CDC. Introduction of the vaccine led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases in the U.S. A wealth of research has confirmed that there is no relationship between vaccines and autism and has repeatedly validated the safety of the measles vaccine.

""Protect yourself and your loved ones by making sure that they are up to date on the measles vaccine,"" Mukundan said. ""Prevention, meaning vaccination, is always better than cure.""

10,43,"This schedule of recommended immunizations may vary depending upon where you live, your child's health, the type of vaccine, and the vaccines available.

Some of the vaccines may be given as part of a combination vaccine so that a child gets fewer shots. Talk with your doctor about which vaccines your kids need.
• HepB: Hepatitis B vaccine. Ideally, the first dose is given within 24 hours of birth, but kids not previously immunized can get it at any age. Some low birth weight infants will get it at 1 month or when they're discharged from the hospital.
• HepB: Second dose should be given 1 to 2 months after the first dose.
• Hib: This third dose may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used in previous Hib immunizations.
• RV: This third dose may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used in previous RV immunizations.
• Influenza (Flu): The flu vaccine is recommended every year for children 6 months and older:
• Kids younger than 9 who get the flu vaccine for the first time (or who have only had one dose before July 2019) will get it in 2 separate doses at least a month apart.
• Those younger than 9 who have had at least 2 doses of flu vaccine previously (in the same or different seasons) will only need 1 dose.
• Kids older than 9 need only 1 dose.
• The vaccine is given by injection with a needle (the flu shot) or by nasal spray. Both types of vaccine can be used this flu season (2019–2020) because they seem to work equally well. Your doctor will recommend which to use based on your child's age and general health. The nasal spray is only for healthy people ages 2–49. People with weak immune systems or some health conditions (such as asthma) and pregnant women should not get the nasal spray vaccine.
• HepA: Hepatitis A vaccine; given as 2 shots at least 6 months apart
• HPV: Human papillomavirus vaccine, given in 2 shots over a 6- to 12-month period. It can be given as early as age 9. For teens and young adults (ages 15–26 in girls and boys both), it is given in 3 shots over 6 months. It's recommended for both girls and boys to prevent genital warts and some types of cancer.
• Tdap: Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster. Also recommended during each pregnancy a woman has.
• Meningococcal conjugate vaccine: And a booster dose is recommended at age 16.
• Meningococcal B vaccine (MenB): The MenB vaccine may be given to kids and teens in 2 or 3 doses, depending on the brand. Unlike the meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which is recommended, the decision to get the MenB vaccine is made by the teens, their parents, and the doctor.
• HepA can be given as early as 6 months of age to babies who will travel to a place where hepatitis A is common (they will still need routine vaccination after their first birthday). It's also recommended for older kids who did not get it in the past.
• The MMR vaccine can be given to babies as young as 6 months old if they will be traveling internationally. These children should still get the recommended routine doses at 12–15 months and 4–6 years of age, but can get the second dose as early as 4 weeks after the first if they will still be traveling and at risk.
• The flu vaccine is especially important for kids who are at risk for health problems from the flu. High-risk groups include, but aren't limited to, kids younger than 5 years old and those with chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, heart problems, sickle cell disease, diabetes, or HIV.
• Pneumococcal vaccines can be given to older kids (age 2 and up) who have conditions that affect their immune systems, such as asplenia or HIV infection, or other conditions, like a cochlear implant, chronic heart disease, or chronic lung disease.
• The meningococcal vaccines can be given to kids as young as 8 weeks old (depending on the vaccine brand) who are at risk for a meningococcal infection, such as meningitis. This includes children with some immune disorders. Kids who live in (or will travel to) countries where meningitis is common, or where there is an outbreak, also should get the vaccine.

11,885,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are fronting a new campaign looking at mental health issues amid the coronavirus pandemic.

They have been interviewed on the BBC about the scheme - called Every Mind Matters.

Here is the transcript.

Q: How are you helping get the message out there with Every Mind Matters?

Duke of Cambridge: So Every Mind Matters obviously is in its second guise now coming out - we got a lot of feedback from the NHS and from others that people were accessing the online plan, so we felt very strongly that now more than ever this was a vital tool and a vital service that people could easily access at home to guide them and give them just some very basic tips to mind their mental health, to mind their mental wellbeing through this process. I think again staying connected, staying positive and being able to talk to friends and family is so crucial and having just some tips and some ideas as to how to tackle some of these strange feelings and difficult circumstances we’re finding ourselves in is really important, just to nudge us through these next few weeks.

Duke of Cambridge: What I’ve heard as well Tina is about the fact that in many of these cases obviously NHS workers, frontline workers are used to dealing sadly with very sad situations, death and things like that but I think the scale and the speed of what’s going on in hospitals, bearing in mind also the isolation, a lot of these patients are dying with no family members around them. I think for the NHS frontline workers that is very difficult, because they are there right next to the bedsides, looking after and caring for each and every patient in a critical condition and I think they take away that pain and that sometimes that fear and loneliness that these patients have to go through, they’re the ones who absorb that and take it home to their families and I think again, I’ve spoken about the attrition and the daily attrition rate of that happening to somebody is not normal and we’re not super human any of us, so to be able to manage those emotions and that feeling is going to take some time after all this is over as well.

Q: Do you think this will fundamentally change who we are and what we value?

Duchess of Cambridge: Yeah, absolutely, I think what we’re saying now is the NHS and the frontline workers are doing the most extraordinary job and that’s really come to the forefront in the last few weeks and I think it’s going to dramatically change how we all value and see our frontline workers and I think that is one of the main positives that you can take from this. They do an extraordinary job it does unrecognised daily and now I think all of us as a nation can really see how hard they work and how vital their work is.",mainstream,M0a379,vaccine
12,1248,"Days after it was revealed in an intercepted human intelligence report that Bill Gates offered $10 million bribe for a forced Coronavirus vaccination program in Nigeria, now an Italian politician has demanded the arrest of Bill Gates in the Italian parliament.

Sara Cunial, the Member of Parliament for Rome denounced Bill Gates as a “vaccine criminal” and urged the Italian President to hand him over to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. She also exposed Bill Gates’ agenda in India and Africa, along with the plans to chip the human race through the digital identification program ID2020.

As reported by GreatGameIndia earlier, in 2015 it were the Italians who exposed secret Chinese biological experiments with Coronavirus.

The video, which was broadcast in November, 2015, showed how Chinese scientists were doing biological experiments on a SARS connected virus believed to be Coronavirus, derived from bats and mice, asking whether it was worth the risk in order to be able to modify the virus for compatibility with human organisms.

In an extraordinary seven-minute speech met with wide applause, Sara Cunial, the Member of Parliament for Rome said that Italy had been subjected to a “Holy Inquisition of false science.”

She roundly criticized the unnecessary lockdown imposed on her fellow Italians in the service of a globalist agenda.

She urged fellow political leaders to desist in any plans to compel citizens to surrender themselves to compulsory COVID-19 vaccination at the hands of the corrupt elite – whom she identified as the Deep State.

Hobbes said that absolute power does not come from an imposition from above but by the choice of individuals who feel more protected renouncing to their own freedom and granting it to a third party.

With this, you are going on anesthetizing the minds with corrupted Mass Media with Amuchina (a brand of disinfectant promoted by Mass Media) and NLP, with words like “regime”, “to allow” and “to permit”, to the point of allowing you to regulate our emotional ties and feelings and certify our affects.

So, in this way, Phase 2 is nothing else than the persecution/continuation of Phase 1 – you just changed the name, as you did with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). We have understood people, for sure, don’t die for the virus alone.

So people will be allowed to die and suffer, thanks to you and your laws, for misery and poverty. And, as in the “best” regimes, the blame will be dropped only on citizens. You take away our freedom and say that we looked for it. Divide et Impera (Divide and Rule).

It is our children who will lose more, who are ‘raped souls’, with the help of the so-called “guarantor of their rights” and of CISMAI (Italian Coordination of Services against Child Abuse).

In this way, the right to school will be granted only with a bracelet to get them used to probation, to get them used to slavery – involuntary treatment and to virtual lager. All this in exchange for a push-scooter and a tablet.

All to satisfy the appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is the conflict of interest, conflict well represented by the WHO, whose main financier is the well-known “philanthropist and savior of the world” Bill Gates.

We all know it, now. Bill Gates, already in 2018, predicted a pandemic, simulated in October 2019 at the “Event 201”, together with Davos (Switzerland). For decades, Gates has been working on Depopulation policy and dictatorial control plans on global politics, aiming to obtain the primacy on agriculture, technology and energy.

Gates said, I quote exactly from his speech:

“If we do a good job on vaccines, health and reproduction, we can reduce the world population by 10-15%. Only a genocide can save the world”.

With his vaccines, Gates managed to sterilize millions of women in Africa. Gates caused a polio epidemic that paralyzed 500,000 children in India and still today with DTP, Gates causes more deaths than the disease itself.

And he does the same with GMOs designed by Monsanto and “generously donated” to needy populations.

All this while he is already thinking about distributing the quantum tattoo for vaccination recognition and mRNA vaccines as tools for reprogramming our immune system. In addition, Gates also does business with several multinationals that own 5G facilities in the USA.

On this table there is the entire Deep State in Italian sauce: Sanofi, together with GlaxoSmithKline are friends of the Ranieri Guerra, Ricciardi, and of the well-known virologist that we pay 2000 Euro every 10 minutes for the presentations on Rai (Italian state TV. She’s probably talking about Burioni).

Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline sign agreements with medical societies to indoctrinate future doctors, making fun of their autonomy of judgment and their oath.

Hi-Tech multinationals, like the Roman Engineering which is friend of the noble Mantoan, or Bending Spoons, of Pisano, which are there for control and manage our personal health datas in agreement with the European Agenda ID2020 of electronic identification, which aims to use mass vaccination to obtain a digital platform of digital ID.

This is a continuation of the transfer of data started by Renzi to IBM. Renzi, in 2016, gave a plus 30% to Gates Global Fund.

On the Deep State table there are the people of Aspen, like the Saxon Colao, who with his 4-pages reports, paid 800 Euros/hour, with no scientific review, dictates its politics as a Bilderberg general as he is, staying away from the battlefield.

The list is long. Very long. In the list there is also Mediatronic, by Arcuri and many more.

The Italian contribution to the International Alliance Against Coronavirus will be of 140 million Euros, of which 120 million Euros will be given to GAVI Alliance, the non-profit by Gates Foundation.

They are just a part of the 7.4 billion Euro fund by the EU to find a vaccine against Coronavirus – vaccines which will be used as I said before.

No money, ofcourse for serotherapy, which has the collateral effect of being super cheap.

No money for prevention, a real prevention, which includes our lifestyles, our food and our relationship with the environment.

The real goal of all of this is total control. Absolute domination of human beings, transformed into guinea pigs and slaves, violating sovereignty and free will.

All this thanks to tricks/hoax disguised as political compromises.

While you rip up the Nuremberg Code with involuntary treatment, fines and deportation, facial recognition and intimidation, endorsed by dogmatic scientism – protected by our “Multi-President” of the Republic who is real cultural epidemic of this country.

We, with the people, will multiply the fires of resistance in a way that you won’t be able to repress all of us.

I ask you, President, to be the spokesperson and give an advice to our President Conte: Dear Mr. President Conte, next time you receive a phone call from the philanthropist Bill Gates forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. If you won’t do this, tell us how we should define you, the “friend lawyer” who takes orders from a criminal.

13,712,"Humans may be to blame for rising mercury levels in a species of fish that's very popular as food, according to a news study published this week. Levels of a potentially poisonous form of the element have been creeping up in Pacific yellowfin tuna 3.8 percent every year since 1998, according to a report discussed an article by the Los Angeles Times.

Methyl Mercury levels in tuna and other large fish have been a public health concern for some time. Health authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration recommend that young children, as well as women who are either pregnant or nursing limit their intake of tuna, and avoid other large species entirely, including swordfish and tilefish.

The study adds to evidence suggesting that human activity—particularly the burning of coal—is causing a buildup of the element in the air and water that is subsequently making its way into the food chain, according to an article in the Los Angeles Times discussing the research. Some fishing industry groups have long maintained that mercury levels in tuna and large fish are stable and come from natural sources, such as deep ocean vents.

Yellowfin—sometimes called ahi tuna—is sold in steaks and eaten in sushi, and can be sometimes found in small amounts in canned light tuna. The fact that the fish are not top-level predators could indicate that a broader swath of ocean life may be accumulating mercury levels that would make them hazardous to human health, if eaten.

""What this number is saying is that the amount of mercury in fish is getting higher and higher all the time, and if it keeps going like that, at some point, most every kind of fish is going to be potentially hazardous,"" study coauthor Carl Lamborg told the Los Angeles Times. ""Where that point is, I don't know.""

President Clinton Unveils Millennium Initiative to Promote Delivery of Existing Vaccines 

in Developing Countries and Accelerate Development of New Vaccines In his State of the Union address, President Clinton will call for concerted international action to combat infectious diseases in developing countries. These diseases cause almost half of all deaths worldwide of people under age 45, killing over eight million children each year and orphaning millions more. The President committed the United States to addressing this terrible problem in his September speech to the United Nations General Assembly. Now the President is asking for foundations, pharmaceutical companies, international agencies, and other governments to join us in this task, and he is announcing these specific elements of his Millennium Initiative:
• A new financial commitment to purchase and deliver existing vaccines in poor countries. As Vice President Gore told the U. N. Security Council earlier this month, the Administration�s FY 2001 budget will include a proposed $50 million contribution to the vaccine purchase fund of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).
• Increased investments in health in developing countries. The President is calling on the World Bank and other multilateral development banks to dedicate an additional $400 million to $900 million annually of their low-interest-rate loans to expand immunization, prevent and treat infectious diseases, and build effective delivery systems for other basic health services. These investments are as central to economic progress as investments in education and physical infrastructure, and they would build on the new focus on basic health services that we have supported as part of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative. This proposed shift in existing resources does not require additional U.S. budget expenditures.
• A significant increase in basic research on diseases that affect developing nations. The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for the National Institutes of Health includes a sharp step-up in research critical to the development of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.
• A new tax credit for sales of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS to accelerate the invention and production of these vaccines. Because developing countries often cannot afford to buy vaccines, the market provides little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines for diseases that disproportionately affect those countries. This tax credit would provide such an incentive, because every dollar paid by a qualifying organization to buy a qualifying vaccine would be matched by a dollar of tax credits � representing up to $1 billion of additional funding for future vaccine purchases. The President is calling on other governments to make similar purchase commitments, so that we can ensure a future market for these critically needed vaccines. Infectious Diseases Pose a Mounting Social and Economic Burden on Developing Countries � And a Threat to Our Health As Well.
• More than eight million children die each year of centuries-old diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and respiratory and diarrheal diseases. Deaths from the modern scourge of AIDS are climbing rapidly. Altogether, as many children die of infectious diseases each year as the total number of combatants who perished in World War I.
• In an interconnected and highly mobile world, health crises in other countries are a threat to everyone. We have seen this with HIV/AIDS, with the resurfacing of tuberculosis, and with the outbreak last year of West Nile encephalitis in New York. According to the Global Health Council, during the past 50 years, at least five times as many Americans have died from communicable diseases that have come from the developing world than have died in military conflicts. Vaccines Are One of the Most Cost-Effective Ways to Improve the Well-Being and Productivity of the Poorest Countries � And Medicines and Other Basic Health Services Are a Necessary Complement.
• It costs about $17 to immunize a child, but millions of children die each year of diseases that could be prevented by existing vaccines. Indeed, children in developing nations are 10 times more likely to die of a vaccine-preventable disease than children in developed nations. And these tragedies occur in spite of the enormous efforts of UNICEF and others to vaccinate children, which save 3 million lives each year.
• Highly effective vaccines do not yet exist for malaria, TB and AIDS, which take over 5 million lives each year. But developed nations have the scientific and technological capacity to make new vaccines possible. For example, recent work on genetic sequencing, including the human genome, will open vast possibilities.
• Another health investment with very high returns is simple preventive and curative services. Providing this basic health care together with vaccines would save millions of lives each year. A $50 Million Contribution to GAVI to Buy Vaccines For Children � Which Will Save Lives Now and Create Confidence that a Market for New Vaccines Will Exist in the Future.
• GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, was formed as a collaborative effort of UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, private foundations, bilateral aid agencies (including the U.S. Agency for International Development), industry representatives, and developing countries. GAVI established the �Global Fund for Children�s Vaccines� with an initial grant of $750 million over 5 years from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The formal launch of GAVI, and the official announcement of the Gates gift, will occur shortly in Davos, Switzerland.
• A U.S. contribution will help to purchase vaccines for Hepatitis B, Haemophilus Influenzae B (Hib), and Yellow Fever, along with related safe delivery equipment such as auto-destruct syringes. To ensure that GAVI�s vaccine purchases complement, rather than replace, existing vaccination efforts, they will be conditional on a country achieving 50 percent coverage of the DTP (diptheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccine, which is included along with measles and polio in the existing EPI (Expanded Program for Immunization).
• A U.S. contribution will hopefully catalyze significant contributions from other countries and foundations. It will also add crucial credibility to the international community�s commitment to provide a market for new vaccines when they are developed. We Must Shift Existing International Resources Toward Building Health Infrastructure in Poor Countries That Can Deliver Vaccines and Medicines and Provide Essential Basic Health Services.
• The World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs, such as the African Development Fund) lend money on highly favorable terms to the world�s poorest countries. Today, roughly $1 billion to $1-1/2 billion of this so-called � concessional funding� is devoted to health care each year. The Administration proposes to increase that amount by $400 million to $900 million per year, with a focus on:
• prevention of diseases using basic measures such as information and condoms for AIDS, treated bed nets for malaria, and stronger systems for containing TB;
• treatment of diseases, including common respiratory and diarrheal infections; and
• The Administration is exploring ways to use the HIPC debt reform to support this part of the Millennium Initiative. One possibility is to make an increase in vaccination rates one of the performance targets monitored in the HIPC progress reports. This could be accompanied by debtor countries� agreements to include specific improvements in vaccine delivery systems as priority uses of debt relief proceeds. We also expect that all Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers that are prepared for HIPC candidates will discuss the adequacy of budget resources and suggested policy reforms devoted to basic health care.
• This re-direction of resources supports the Administration�s overall strategy for global development, which emphasizes poverty reduction and gives a central role to �global public goods� � like health or the environment � in which positive actions taken in one country benefit other countries as well. To meet this objective, these funds should not come from spending on other basic social programs, such as education and health care.
• This aspect of the Millennium Initiative does not require a new budgetary commitment by the United States (or other donor countries). However, the U.S. ability to influence the direction of MDB lending and the use of HIPC proceeds depends crucially on meeting our existing commitments to these aid programs. We will work with other G-8 finance and development ministries to refine this proposal.
• A conservative estimate suggests that if basic health care including immunization were made broadly available, up to 2 million children�s lives could be saved each year. Higher Funding for Basic Scientific Research Through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Elsewhere Will Hasten the Development of Vaccines for Malaria, TB, and AIDS.
• The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for NIH includes a significant increase in research critical to creating vaccines for these diseases. For malaria and TB, this increase will build on recent advances in the genetic sequencing of these diseases, which have set the stage for major breakthroughs in vaccine development.
• Funding for NIH malaria vaccine research will increase more than 10 percent over the FY 2000 level. Future research will range from pre-clinical studies aimed at improving our understanding of the malaria parasite, through the development of vaccine candidates, to clinical trials judging vaccine efficacy and safety. NIH will also expand its collaboration with scientists in malaria-endemic regions, especially in Africa, to strengthen those regions� capacity for conducting clinical trials of malaria vaccines in the future.
• NIH research on a tuberculosis vaccine will receive over 40 percent more funding than in FY 2000 and more than double the FY 1999 level. NIH will focus on studying the body�s defense mechanisms against TB, and developing and studying vaccine candidates. Through its Tuberculosis Research Unit, NIH supports an international multi-disciplinary team to translate advances in basic research into new tools for fighting TB.
• NIH funding for AIDS vaccine research will increase substantially in FY 2001 and will have more than doubled since FY 1997. These additional resources will allow NIH to accelerate basic research on developing vaccine candidates and to significantly expand testing of potential vaccine candidates in both developing and developed countries. The new Vaccine Research Center on the NIH campus, which will be occupied this summer, will receive a sizeable increase in funding for the development and pre-clinical testing of HIV vaccine candidates.
• The Administration is providing strong support for the path-breaking research on infectious diseases being conducted by U.S. military scientists, including the opening (in October 1999) of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research/Naval Medical Research Center. Working in close collaboration with scientists worldwide, military scientists have developed and tested successful vaccines against Japanese encephalitis and hepatitis A � and they are working to create vaccines and medicines to protect service people, travelers, and millions of others from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases. A New Tax Credit Would Effectively Provide Up to $1 Billion for Future Vaccine Purchases, Speeding the Invention and Production of New Vaccines.
• Current tax law provides substantial incentives for pharmaceutical research and development, including the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit, the orphan drug tax credit, and an enhanced deduction for charitable contributions of certain products. Nonetheless, pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to invest in developing vaccines for diseases that primarily afflict people in poor countries, because little or no paying market exists in those countries.
• Under the proposal, the seller of a qualified vaccine could claim a tax credit equal to 100 percent of the amount paid by a qualifying organization that received a �credit allocation� by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). The tax credit would match the qualified organizations� expenditures dollar-for-dollar, thereby doubling their purchasing power. A qualifying vaccine would be a new vaccine that received FDA approval for use against malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or any infectious disease that causes over 1 million deaths annually worldwide.
• For 2002 through 2010, AID could designate up to $1 billion of vaccine sales as eligible for the credit. This tax credit would be limited to new vaccines developed to fight these terrible diseases. The credit would provide a specific and credible commitment to purchase future vaccines at reasonable prices. Together with similar commitments from foundations and other governments, it would provide a critical and powerful incentive to accelerate vaccine research and development.",mainstream,M0a608,vaccine
15,462,"The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is not linked to development of autism spectrum disorders, even among children considered to be at risk, a large new study finds.

Among nearly 100,000 children, receipt of the MMR vaccine did not increase the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), regardless of whether kids were at higher risk because an older sibling already had the condition, researchers write in JAMA.

""Even for children who are high-risk, the vaccine does not play a role,"" said lead author Dr. Anjali Jain of healthcare consulting firm The Lewin Group in Falls Church, Virginia. ""We don’t know what does unfortunately, but it’s not the MMR vaccine.""

The results should be reassuring, she said.

Autism spectrum disorder is a range of symptoms that often includes difficulties with communication and social interaction, according to the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health. It's may also include restricted and repetitive behaviors.

The 1998 study that claimed to find a connection between the MMR vaccine and ASD was later debunked. The Lancet, the medical journal that originally published it, withdrew it. Studies continue to vouch for the safety of the vaccine.

Still, some people continue to believe that the vaccine is connected to ASD.

Parents of children with ASD may also believe there is a genetic component, and so they decline to vaccinate their other children, Jain and colleagues noted in their report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

For the new study, the researchers used insurance claims data on 95,727 children followed from birth to at least age five between 2001 and 2012. They also had data on the children's older siblings.

Overall, about 2 percent of the children had an older sibling with ASD. Those children were more likely to go on to develop ASD themselves whether they were vaccinated or not, according to the report.

The vaccine didn't increase their risk, the researchers say.

For example, among high-risk five year olds, ASD developed in 23 of 269 who weren't vaccinated (8.6 percent), compared to 30 of 796 (3.8 percent) who received two doses of the MMR vaccine.

Among kids not at high risk of ASD, 7,735 were unvaccinated at age five and 56 (0.7 percent) were diagnosed with the condition. That compared to 244 of 45,568 children (0.5 percent) who received two MMR doses.

Furthermore, children with an older sibling with ASD were significantly less likely to have received the MMR vaccine in the first place.

By age five, about 92 percent of the children without ASD in the family had received at least one MMR dose. By comparison, only 86 percent of children with an older sibling with ASD had been vaccinated by that age.

""I think it’s important to show that the degree of undervaccination in the families with children with autism spectrum disorder was significant,"" Jain told Reuters Health.

Alongside the lack of association between the vaccine and ASD, the undervaccination rate deserves attention, she said.

Roughly a dozen studies have shown that age of ASD onset and its severity do not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, wrote Dr. Bryan King, program director of the Autism Center at Seattle Children's Hospital, in an editorial accompanying the new study.

The new study, King added, now shows that ""the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.""",mainstream,M09b4b,vaccine.autism
16,1022,"Last week, Jerome Adams, the Surgeon General of the United States, announced that the federal coronavirus taskforce has turned its back on the “predictive contagion” computer models pushed by international health “experts” — who advised the U.S. government to shut down nonessential services and force unemployed citizens to huddle at home in fear rather than suffer monumental losses from possible exposure to the virus.

During a live interview on Sirius XM radio, the nation’s top doctor said that data from the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Bill Gates (“King Vaccine”) would be shelved in favor of real data:

“What the American people need to know now is we actually have data and so we’re tracking that data.”

Alarmingly high WHO estimates of the number of people in this country considered at risk from getting and dying from the Wuhan coronavirus have proven to be grossly inaccurate. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have not succumbed to the novel strain of infection, as these self-styled experts insisted.

It has been confirmed that various coronavirus reporting agencies have artificially inflated the real number of diagnosed cases and deaths directly due to a COVID-19 infection. The reason behind this charade is to generate fear, make the masses compliant with New World Order directives, and topple the U.S. economy.

A growing number of independent international health experts are contradicting the alarmism being spread around the world in the face of a bad case of the flu. Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, a microbiology specialist, professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, and head of the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, said:

“We are afraid that 1 million infections with the new virus will lead to 30 deaths per day over the next 100 days. But we do not realize that 20, 30, 40 or 100 patients positive for normal coronaviruses are already dying every day.” [emphasis added]

Dr. Bhakdi called the government’s COVID-19 response measures “grotesque, absurd and very dangerous,” and added that they are shortening the life expectancy of millions of people. The panic is a fraud, according to the much-cited research scientist:

“The horrifying impact on the world economy threatens the existence of countless people. The consequences on medical care are profound. Already services to patients in need are reduced, operations canceled, practices empty, hospital personnel dwindling. All this will impact profoundly on our whole society.

“All these measures are leading to self-destruction and collective suicide based on nothing but a spook.”

Dr. Joel Kettner, a professor of Community Health Sciences and Surgery at Manitoba University in Canada, former Chief Public Health Officer for Manitoba province, and Medical Director of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases, said:

“I have never seen anything like this, anything anywhere near like this. I’m not talking about the pandemic, because I’ve seen 30 of them, one every year. It is called influenza. And other respiratory illness viruses, we don’t always know what they are. But I’ve never seen this reaction, and I’m trying to understand why.”

Many observers agree with Dr. Kettner’s assessment of the message being broadcast by the globalist health nazis:

“I worry about the message to the public, about the fear of coming into contact with people, being in the same space as people, shaking their hands, having meetings with people. I worry about many, many consequences related to that.”

Adams told Alex Marlow, host of Breitbart News Daily, that the real numbers show that businesses are safe to re-open in May and June. The NWO health nazis want U.S. business owners to fail by keeping them idle for six months or more. They are trying to push a national vaccine ID card that would determine whether or not citizens can travel or renew their driver’s licenses.

The Surgeon General said that, based on actual test data rather than doomsday prophesies based on theoretical computer simulations, U.S. businesses “in some places” can expect to resume operations in May or June. Locations hardest hit by the contagion, however, will continue living with the current medical lockdown:

“Other places won’t; it will be piece by piece, bit by bit, but will be data-driven,” advised Adams.

Frustrated citizens around the U.S. are gathering at their statehouses to voice their opposition to the prolonged enforced idleness and ridiculously unfair new rules on what is nonessential, including tools and seeds, from petty bureaucrats enjoying expanded powers under the national emergency.",conspiracy,C00f7e,bill.gates; vaccine.covid
17,737,"The U.S. government alone spends $200 million a year on a hunt for a vaccine against AIDS. At the forefront of that search stands Dr. David Baltimore, chairman of the National Institute of Health's AIDS Vaccine Research Committee. Currently president of the California Institute of Technology as well, Baltimore won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Betsey Arledge, producer of the NOVA film ""Surviving AIDS,"" interviewed a cautiously optimistic Baltimore on the current state of the search for a vaccine.



 

 NOVA: Can you give me a sense of the magnitude of the AIDS epidemic at this time?



 Baltimore: The AIDS epidemic in this country is a serious issue, but it's not a major public health disaster the way it is abroad. In the world today there are something like 34 million infected people, and more people are being infected every minute. On the scale of any public health issue in the world, this is one of the major ones. There are more people dying of AIDS than of almost any other infectious disease, with tuberculosis and malaria being in the same ballpark. It's a horrendous situation. (See AIDS in Perspective.)



 NOVA: Do you think we're getting a little complacent in this country?



 



 Baltimore: I'm impressed that AIDS remains a very noted disease in the United States. It's noted in the newspapers all the time—what's going on in the world and in the country. There is very complete coverage of how good the drugs are and where the vaccine program stands. I don't think we've allowed it to fall off the radar screen. And we do far more AIDS research than the whole rest of the world; in the vaccine area alone, we do probably 90 percent of the research.



 NOVA: Can you give me a sense of the amount of effort—not just money, but intellectual effort—that has gone into trying to find a vaccine over the past 10 or 15 years?



 



 Baltimore: When H.I.V. was first discovered, the first thing that the then-Secretary of what became the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said was, ""We will have a vaccine in short order."" She was wrong about that, but it shows that from the very first moment a vaccine was on people's minds. Indeed, there has been a significant effort to make a vaccine from the very first day. I think people thought it would be simple, because we'd made vaccines for so many different viruses.



 The polio vaccine is effective because, for the most part, our bodies naturally fight this virus. This is not the case with HIV. The thing that worried me at the time—and it has turned out to be the biggest worry—was that if it were possible to make a vaccine, why doesn't the body ordinarily fight off the virus? Most viruses we fight off very well, including polio and even smallpox. A certain fraction of people may be maimed or killed by those viruses, but the much larger fraction of people get over them. That's not true for H.I.V. We knew that from very early on.



 



 At first we thought it might be that many people would be killed by it, and then we began to realize that almost everybody who had the infection was potentially going to be killed by it. That's fundamentally different than other viruses. And that fundamental difference was a red flag. The initial impetus that we'd be able to do it, it's around the corner, was just all wrong.



 NOVA: So the search for a vaccine has been a real struggle?



 Baltimore: It's been an enormous struggle, because the obvious things didn't work, and people got very frustrated by that. The next question became: Where do you turn? What's not obvious? What can we do? That involved bringing a whole different level of people into the discussion. Not the ordinary people who make vaccines, but people whose scientific focus is in other areas of immunology, of infectious disease—basic scientists. So it's been a ramping up process to get more and more people involved and thinking about it.



 Perhaps the most important role of the committee I'm now heading is to galvanize the scientific community to find new routes in thinking about a vaccine, so that maybe we can find a vaccine through some very non-traditional approach.



 NOVA: An international team of scientists announced recently that they had traced the origin of the AIDS virus to a subspecies of chimpanzee in Africa. If this report is verified, how will it help in the search for a vaccine?



 Baltimore: In truth, it will not have much effect on the search for a vaccine. However, it tells us a lot about why HIV is so hard to counter. It is not a virus that is native to the human species, and therefore it is continually mutating in an effort to adapt. Most human viruses are well-controlled by the human immune system, because they have evolved with it, and the two opposing forces are in a steady-state. We cannot wait until we and HIV evolve to being comfortable with each other. We must devise a vaccine, effectively short-circuiting the usual process of adaptation.



 NOVA: Who are the so-called long-term non-progressors, and how do they fit into the search?



 Bob Massie is a long-term non-progressor. His immune system's ability to fight HIV is inspiring a new approach to fighting AIDS. Baltimore: There is a small group of H.I.V.-infected people—maybe five percent—who don't get any symptoms and whose virus is maintained at a very low level. If we could find out the secret behind that, maybe we could replicate it in a vaccine. So far we haven't found the secret, but there are good correlations. These people have a good cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, they have a good helper T cell response. [Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, otherwise known as CTLs or CD8 killer T-cells, are cells involved in immune defense that can kill other cells infected by viruses. So-called CD4 helper T cells are essential for triggering antibody production, activating CTLs, and initiating other immune responses.] So that says if we can make those a focus of activity, maybe we can design a vaccine around those principles. But there's no certainty that those are the key issues.



 



 There is a balance of three things: whether the virus that those people have is different than the virus other people have; whether their immune system is somehow responding to it differently than other people's immune systems are; and whether their genetics are different. Are they inherently able to fight the virus? Or is it something that's learned and that therefore we could teach other people to do?

18,532,"This week, the first patients in a clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine were given shots, marking a key step in the global race to find a cure. Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle developed a COVID-19 vaccine in record time and started administering the shots on Monday.

The first person to receive a dose of the potential vaccine was 43-year-old Jennifer Haller, an operations manager at a small tech company, according to The Associated Press. ""We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,"" Haller said, adding that her two teenagers ""think it's cool"" that she's taking part in the study.

Ultimately, 45 volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get two doses the vaccine over a span of about 6 weeks, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH, is funding the trial. The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID, and Moderna, Inc., a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company.

""Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,"" NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said. ""This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.""

Other potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed around the world, including at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. On Monday's ""CBS Evening News,"" David Martin spoke to doctors there to learn more about the potential cures.

Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad, a director at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, is testing a potential vaccine that would block the virus from attaching to a person's lung. ""If it can't get into your lung cells, it can't cause the disease,"" Modjarrad said.

Still, the race for the coronavirus vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to run, Martin reports. So, Lieutenant Colonel Mara Kreishman-Deitrick is working on a drug that people who already have the disease can take.

""What we're aiming to develop here is an antiviral treatment that will kill the virus and actually cure them of the disease so they don't further spread it to the rest of the community,"" she told Martin.

Kreishman-Deitrick says an existing drug used against Ebola may work against the novel coronavirus as well. ""It's ready for a clinical trial in humans and once those clinical trials show that it's affected then it will be available for wider use in humans,"" she said. It hasn't yet been proved effective but could be used as an emergency treatment.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has killed at more than 90 people in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Globally, the death toll is over 7,500, with the most aggressive outbreaks still spreading in Europe and Iran.

Dr. Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Tuesday in a live webcast about the coronavirus pandemic that ""in some respects we are just getting started in the United States.""",mainstream,M0b986,vaccine
19,723,"A new trial has begun in Victoria this week to evaluate a potential vaccine against COVID-19.

The vaccine is called NVX-CoV2373 and is from a US biotech company, Novavax.

The trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane, and is the first human trial of a vaccine specifically for COVID-19 to take place in Australia.

This vaccine is actually based on a vaccine that was already in development for influenza. But how might it work against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19?

Read more: Could BCG, a 100-year-old vaccine for tuberculosis, protect against coronavirus?

Vaccines trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a virus in a safe way, without any exposure to the pathogen itself.

All vaccines have to do two things. The first is make our immune cells bind to and “eat up” the vaccine. The second is to activate these immune cells so they’re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the virus in question.

We often add molecules called adjuvants to vaccines to deliver a danger signal to the immune system, activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response.

Read more: Revealed: the protein 'spike' that lets the 2019-nCoV coronavirus pierce and invade human cells

The Novavax vaccine is what we call a “subunit” vaccine because, instead of delivering the whole virus, it delivers only part of it. The element of SARS-CoV-2 in this vaccine is the spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus.

By targeting a particular protein, a subunit vaccine is a great way to focus the immune response.

However, protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system. Proteins are generally soluble, which doesn’t appeal to immune cells. They like something they can chew on.

So instead of soluble protein, Novavax has assembled the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into very small particles, called nanoparticles. To immune cells, these nanoparticles look like little viruses, so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein, rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated.

The Novavax vaccine also contains an adjuvant called Matrix-M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal, Matrix-M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system.

The Novavax vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a vaccine the company was already developing for influenza, called NanoFlu.

The NanoFlu vaccine contains similar parts – nanoparticles with the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle (hemagglutinin, which is on the outside of the influenza virus).

In October last year, Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial, the last level of clinical testing before a vaccine can be licensed. This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone, a standard influenza vaccine.

Read more: Where are we at with developing a vaccine for coronavirus?

An important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65. Older people tend to have poorer responses to vaccines, because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age.

This trial is ongoing, with volunteers to be followed until the end of the year. However, early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone – even given the older people in the trial.

Antibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs. So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza.

These results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu, and suggest NanoFlu would be the superior vaccine for influenza.

So the big question is – will the same strategy work for SARS-CoV-2?

The new phase I/II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the vaccine’s safety and measure how it affects the body’s immune response.

Some volunteers will not receive the vaccine, as a placebo control. The rest will receive the vaccine, in a few different forms.

The trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles – a low (5 microgram) or a high (25 microgram) dose. Both doses will be delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant but the higher dose will also be tested without Matrix-M.

All groups will receive two shots of the vaccine 21 days apart, except one group that will just get one shot.

This design enables researchers to ask four important questions:
• None can the vaccine induce an immune response?
• None if so, what dose of nanoparticle is best?
• None do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough?
• None do you need two shots or is one enough?

Read more: Coronavirus anti-vaxxers aren’t a huge threat yet. How do we keep it that way?

While it’s not yet clear how the vaccine will perform for SARS-CoV-2, Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals.

And we know NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza. NanoFlu also seemed to work well in older adults, which would be essential for a vaccine for COVID-19.

We eagerly await the first set of results, expected in a couple of months – an impressive turnaround time for a clinical trial. If this initial study is successful, the phase II portion of the trial will begin, with more participants.

20,63,"James Jeffrey ""Jeff"" Bradstreet (July 6, 1954 – June 19, 2015), was an American doctor, alternative medicine practitioner, and a former preacher[2] who ran the International Child Development Resource Center in Melbourne, Florida,[3] a medical practice in Buford, Georgia[4] and in Arizona, where he practiced homeopathy.[5][6] He also founded the Good News Doctor Foundation, which aimed to combine Christian beliefs with his medical practice.[7]

Bradstreet obtained a Florida medical license in 1984. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of South Florida in 1976, where he also went to medical school beginning three years later. His postgraduate research focused on aerospace medicine, and he received his training in this field from Wilford Hall Medical Center. He was an adjunct professor of child development and neuroscience at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, Arizona.[8]

Bradstreet published autism research, which he claimed indicated vaccines as a cause, in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which is not indexed by PubMed. This research claimed that autistic children had a higher body burden of mercury,[9] and that three autistic children had measles RNA in their cerebrospinal fluid.[10] The Institute of Medicine has rejected any relationship between vaccines and autism.[11]

Bradstreet treated an autistic child named Colten Snyder (one of the test cases in the autism omnibus trial) with chelation therapy on the premise of removing mercury from his body, in spite of the fact that hair, blood, and urine tests had failed to show he exhibited abnormal levels of mercury.[12] Over an eight-year period, Colten visited Bradstreet's office 160 times.[13] Stephen Barrett has stated, ""It appears to me that Bradstreet decides which of his nonstandard theories to apply and records diagnoses that embody them,"" and describes Bradstreet's mercury provoked tests as ""phony"".[12] Peter Hotez characterized Bradstreet's proposal to treat autism with chelation therapy as ""dangerous.""[6]

In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Bradstreet defended the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as an autism treatment, saying, ""Every kid with autism should have a trial of IVIG if money was not an option and IVIG was abundant.""[14] Bradstreet also published research regarding the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for autism,[15] some of which concluded it was ineffective,[16] as well as a paper arguing that autistic children have an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress.[17] Further treatments Bradstreet used on autistic children included the controversial protein GcMAF, with which he claimed to have treated 600 children.[18] In an article for an anti-vaccine magazine, Bradstreet endorsed stem cell therapy as an autism treatment.[19]

Bradstreet was found dead from a gunshot wound to the chest in the Broad River in Rutherford County, North Carolina in June 2015, after his Buford, Georgia medical office was raided by the FDA in connection with an investigation into GcMAF treatments.[4][20][21] At the time of his death, he lived in Braselton and ran his medical practice in Buford.[4] While the police ruled Bradstreet's death a suicide, several family members and anti-vaccine activists claimed he was murdered in connection with his criticism of vaccines.[22]

Bradstreet's son is autistic, which Bradstreet attributed to a vaccination his son received at age 15 months.[23]

21,331,"Measles cases have spread across the US this year, with the state of New York now facing its worst outbreak in decades.

Since last autumn, more than 150 cases have been recorded in Rockland County, a New York suburb home to a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish community where there has been some resistance to vaccinations.

The vast majority of US states allow families to opt out of getting vaccinated if they object on religious grounds and parents seem to take advantage of these rules.

Researchers have found that broad philosophical and religious exemptions to vaccine requirements are associated with higher rates of unvaccinated children.

But this year’s outbreaks are now raising public health questions about why states allow such exemptions. Here is how religious exemptions work:

What is a religious exemption to a vaccine, and which US states have them?

Religious exemptions allow parents to opt their children out of mandated vaccination policies if they object to the vaccine for religious reasons and if they follow the state’s opt-out process.

Almost every state, plus Washington DC, allows for a religious exemption beginning at least in kindergarten.

Four states do not: California, West Virginia, Mississippi and Arizona.

Each state has its own rules regarding vaccinations for children who attend public schools. In addition to the religious exemption, all 50 states, plus Washington DC, allow exceptions for medical reasons.

Examples include a child who has a condition like cancer or an immune disorder where a vaccine could be harmful to the child’s health.

And more than a dozen states offer philosophical exemptions, sometimes known as personal-belief exemptions, which do not require that a parent’s desire to opt out be specifically about their religious beliefs. Instead, they can include exemptions for conscience or moral ideology.

California, West Virginia and Mississippi, which do not allow religious exemptions, also do not allow philosophical objections.

How are religious exemptions connected to the recent US measles outbreak?

The measles outbreak in the New York suburb of Rockland County has largely been cantered in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, where there has been some recent resistance to vaccinations.

Vaccination rates tend to be low among the ultra-Orthodox, and the reasons vary, from fear of interference from outsiders to confusion over accurate religious and medical information.

The current flare-up in New York and New Jersey, both of which allow religious exemptions, can be traced back to the measles outbreaks in Israel last year.

Because ultra-Orthodox parents often send their children to their own religious schools, the outbreak was initially largely contained. But it has recently spread significantly.

Some Orthodox Jewish schools have been allowing unvaccinated children to attend school, against the New York Health Department’s mandate, during the measles outbreak.

How are vaccines a religious issue for some people?

Some people worry that vaccinating interrupts a divine plan for someone’s life, and they do not want to interfere in God’s will.

Others have concerns that some vaccines could violate religious dietary laws, unless they are designated kosher or halal.

Last year an influential Islamic group in Indonesia issued a controversial fatwa, which was later overturned, against the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine, citing its use of porcine gelatin.

And many of those who oppose abortion object to certain vaccines, like those designed to prevent chickenpox or hepatitis A.

Those vaccines are made by growing viruses in fetal embryo fibroblast cells, or cell lines that are grown in laboratories but are derived from two elective abortions in the 1960s.

A Catholic family in Kentucky, for example, has filed a lawsuit against the Northern Kentucky Health Department for banning unvaccinated students from school and athletics during a chickenpox outbreak at their son’s Catholic school.

Are the recent measles outbreaks causing some US states to reconsider exemptions?

To an extent, yes. Vaccine exemptions for children enrolled in kindergarten have slowly grown over the past decade, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prompting some states to consider changes.

California got rid of its non-medical exemptions in 2015. A few states that allow religious exemptions have made them more difficult to get, requiring things like a signed affidavit from a religious leader instead of simply filling out an online form.

State lawmakers, often Republicans, around the country introduced more than 150 bills from 2011 through 2017 that would have made it easier to obtain exemptions from vaccine policies.

But according to a study in the American Journal of Public Health published in January, the 13 bills signed into law actually limited the ability to exempt.

Some professional organisations have also taken action. The American Association of Pediatrics has made the elimination of non-medical vaccination exemptions its top priority this year, even ranking it above family separations at the border.

Are religious leaders doing anything to address the issue?

Yes. Rabbis and doctors organised a public health campaign to stress the importance of vaccines. The Orthodox Union and the Rabbinal Council of America have strongly urged parents to vaccinate their children.

“It is well known that those facing even a potential life-or-death situation are instructed to set aside the Sabbath and other key tenets of halachic (Jewish law) observance until the emergency has passed,” they said in November.

Elsewhere, local health and community leaders have stressed open communication between health officials and religious leaders to bridge cultural divides.

In Colorado, Dr Joshua Williams, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, has recommended that the groups talk at specific times, such as when the academic year begins or at the start of influenza season, and not just during a health crisis.

He is also working with the state’s Council of Churches to hold sessions with parishioners to hear their concerns.

“Religious vaccinations exemptions impact public health,” Dr Williams said. “There is a need to dialogue with religious leaders around vaccine exemptions at local and national levels.”",mainstream,M09bbb,vaccine.autism
22,1041,"Prof Openshaw, an expert in experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: ""We're actually considering a paper at Nervtag this week which is about targeting of different sub-populations with vaccines.

""I would say that sometimes it's possible to protect a vulnerable group by targeting another group. This, for example, is being done with influenza.""

Although they stand to benefit most because of their vulnerability, older people often derive the least benefit from vaccines because the drugs tend to prompt a weaker immune response.

Prof Openshaw said healthcare workers and people in other public-facing jobs could also be considered for vaccination first.

Also giving evidence, Professor Arne Akbar, the president of the British Society of Immunology, said: ""Vaccines don't work very well in older people. This has been shown with many other vaccines in the past.

""So we might have to have something as well as a vaccine to get optimum protection for older people.""

He suggested that, alongside a vaccine, older people could be offered an anti-inflammatory drug such as dexamethasone, which has recently shown strong results in those who are severely ill with coronavirus.

""Just a vaccine alone will help the younger people, and that will be good because then, if the younger people are not infected, they will not spread it to the older people – but it won't directly help the older group very much,"" Prof Akbar said.

His comments came as a new study of the potential Oxford vaccine in pigs found that two doses induced a better response than one.

This will include developing technology which automatically identifies and removes messages that incite violence….. The G7 will support the creation of an international industry-led forum to develop and share tools of this type, she said.

Contact tracing 'will save lives' if the U.S. builds it

4:30 p.m. ET — Contact tracing, in which trained health officials contact infected people to investigate the source of an outbreak and alert potentially exposed people, is one of the few proven tactics the U.S. has to combat the coronavirus.



In lieu of federal leadership, the effort has been largely relegated to often underfunded health departments that are struggling to meet the unprecedented demand placed on them by the coronavirus pandemic. ″[Contact tracing] is a standard tool and it really works, but when it's not in place, or in the case of when you start trying to implement it after the virus is quite literally already spreading in your community, it's almost impossible to catch up,"" said Dr. Karen Smith, former director of the California Department of Public Health.

Google's U.S. ad revenue will drop for the first time ever, as the pandemic delivers blow to businesses

12:55 p.m. ET — Google's U.S. advertising revenue will see its first-ever decline this year, according to research firm eMarketer, which began modeling the business in 2008. The new report shows the extent to which even Google's robust digital ad business has likely suffered during the coronavirus pandemic, which has taken an especially hard toll on some of the platform's biggest advertisers in the travel industry. While advertising on YouTube is expected to grow, it won't make up for Google's expected 7.2% drop in net U.S. search ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer. The model also signals that Google's digital advertising rivals may be able to close in on the company's No. 1 spot in share of digital ad spend in the U.S. Both Facebook and Amazon are expected to continue growing their U.S. advertising revenue this year, though at slower rates than in previous years. Facebook and Amazon's ad businesses have less exposure to the travel industry than Google, which could help them weather the crisis. —Lauren Feiner

10:34 a.m. ET — With New York City moving its next phase of reopening, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb says the city and region are unlikely to see a major spike in new cases. Some states mostly in the South and West that reopened early — before they had driven spread down to a contained level and before they had the necessary testing and tracing infrastructure in place — have seen major resurgences in infection over the past couple of weeks. ""We'll see an increase in cases, but we're reopening against a much different backdrop,"" Gottlieb said on ""Squawk Box."" ""So I wouldn't expect to see the big increases that they're seeing in the Southeast and the South here when we reopen."" Gottlieb said that because so many people were initially infected in New York City and the tri-state region, a large portion of the population likely has some level of immunity against the virus already. That will help limit spread, Gottlieb added. —William Feuer Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer, genetic-testing start-up Tempus and biotech company Illumina.

25,367,"Legendary gold and market expert Jim Sinclair says the virus that originated in China may have, oddly enough, done some good. Sinclair explains, “The effect of the coronavirus was literally to shut down business globally, therefore, shut off the demand for loans, which also shut off demand for short term money. So, what the public has not seen, is not considering and does not understand is we were stepping into the door of a major financial crisis magnitudes larger than what happened in 2008 and 2009. It’s a horrible thing that this virus occurred, but if it had not occurred, we would have been in a crisis much more serious than 2008 and 2009. . . . It was blowing sky high . . . . Shutting down demand is all we could do. It stopped the explosion of interest rates.”

Where do we go from here? Sinclair says, “We are going to make a recovery. It’s not going to be a ‘V’ by any means. The stock market could be a ‘V’ because the stock market has very little to do with reality. . . . As far as business is concerned, very serious damage has been done to the infrastructure to the business equation. Many employers are gone. Many corporations have significant readjustments to be able to build up again. The supply lines and logistics, where did everything come from? China. . . . This is a major worldwide adjustment, both economically and politically. . . . We had everything made in the cheapest place possible. . . . This is not a passing phenomenon. . . . The only thing that has been steady is gold. . . . The change that this brings about is a reconstruction of the basic business foundations. It’s a start over, it’s not just a slowdown. How many restaurants make money on 50% of the clients? You can’t. How many automobiles have built up on the lots? Enormous amounts. How many clothing stores shut down full of winter clothes and can’t make the shift to summer wear? You can go down the entire line. So, this recovery will be more like an ‘L’. We’ve come straight down, and we are going to go sideways now. . . . Many businesses are not going to open up again. . . .The idea of the coming inflation as a result of this is simple. Everything that you need will go up in price. Everything you don’t need is not going to hold value. You are better off with a freezer full of fine cuts of beef than you are with a brand new Tesla. The beef will go up in price, the Tesla will go down.”

On gold, Sinclair says the ultimate price is an easy-to-calculate math problem. How much gold does America have compared to how much debt it has? So, how high could gold ultimately go? Sinclair says, “It’s simple math. You take the amount of gold the U.S. says it has, and then you take the debt it has, and what price would you need for the debt to balance to zero? The price on the low end is $50,000 per ounce. The true price is $87,500 per ounce.”

Is a biblical debt jubilee coming to America? Sinclair says, “We already have jubilees. If you don’t pay your rent, you have a jubilee. If you don’t pay your student loan, you have a jubilee. If the payment of your auto insurance is postponed, you have a jubilee. We’ve got jubilee after jubilee after jubilee. Keep in mind, one man’s jubilee is another man’s disaster. It’s almost as if the Bible is correct in terms of economics. Also, keep in mind, the people who aren’t being paid are being hurt very badly.”

Sinclair thinks the recovery will take a decade or longer, and Sinclair says, “It will be just like the period between 1929 up to WWII (1941).”

26,774,"The measles outbreaks continue to spread, with New York City declaring a public health emergency and requiring people in four ZIP codes to have their children vaccinated or face penalties, including a fine of US$1,000 and or imprisonment.

Since September 2018, 285 measles cases have been reported in Brooklyn and Queens, mainly in neighborhoods where ultra-Orthodox Jews have chosen to not have their children vaccinated.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that from Jan. 1 to April 4, 2019, 465 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 19 states. This is the second-highest number of cases since the CDC declared measles eliminated in 2000; in 2014, 667 cases occurred.

Cases have still been occurring each year, often brought into the United States from international travelers. Officials believe that to be the cause of the outbreak in Rockland County, New York, where 168 cases were reported as of April 8, 2019.

Rockland public health officials issued a ban that would keep unvaccinated children out of public places, but a judge overruled that on April 5. On April 9, county officials said they would appeal.

But there are limits to what health care providers, public health officials and legislators can do. It is crucial to consider both the power – and the limits – of potential solutions that will provide education, medical care and protection for the public while still upholding principles of informed consent, parental decision-making and sustaining public trust.

As a professor who researches and teaches health law, public health law and medical ethics, I think it’s worth clarifying what states can or cannot legally do when responding to cases of communicable disease.

The law recognizes the right of an individual to refuse medical interventions. Health law has a strong history of recognizing bodily integrity: Adults can choose whether to accept or reject a proposed medical intervention, even in instances where public health authorities conclude a vaccine would benefit both the individual and society. The Supreme Court has recognized parents’ ability to direct the care and control of their children, including consenting or forgoing medical treatment for their child except in very specific circumstances.

In the 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts case, the Supreme Court upheld a state law delegating power to local health officials mandating that adults receive one smallpox vaccine in the midst of an epidemic or pay a fine (about $130 today). Under the concept of police power, states have a duty to enact laws that promote the health, safety and welfare of its residents. Public health authorities may offer vaccines as a method of prevention, but medical professionals, public health authorities and even courts may not legally compel a person to submit to a vaccine.

The Jacobson decision also set forth limits on police power, yet subsequent cases addressing vaccine mandates discarded these requirements, extending multiple vaccine mandates to school attendance for disease not in circulation and in the absence of an epidemic.

Deferring to respected scientific consensus as a means to justify forced medical interventions in the name of individual benefit and the public good has historically resulted in some of the most egregious constitutional and human rights atrocities in the U.S. The mass forcible sterilization during the eugenics movement is but one example.

The history of science and medicine further demonstrates the fallibility of commonly accepted medical knowledge, such as when Bayer introduced heroin as a safe, non-addictive substitute for morphine, or physicians prescribed Bendectin and thalidomide to relieve nausea, only to find these medications resulted in babies born with severe birth defects.

The law is also quite clear that public health authorities and law enforcement may place restrictions on a person’s individual liberty – including religious liberty – in situations where a person’s actions pose a direct, immediate and compelling harm to others, such as using venomous snakes in religious worship or asserting a nonexistent “right” to use an illegal substance such as marijuana when operating a motor vehicle.

In public health law relating to communicable disease, this constitutes a very specific standard: A person must have a present disease, and this person’s actions must pose a direct threat to others.

For example, health officials may seek a quarantine order or civil commitment for a person with active tuberculosis who continues to frequent highly populated public spaces until the person is no longer contagious.

Even in such a case, health authorities can offer treatment and limit a person’s movement to prevent infecting others, but the law does not permit forcibly medicating a competent person against his will.

Accordingly, legal precedent does not support quarantining vast geographic areas of healthy persons who have not been exposed to the communicable illness, but would support tailored voluntary isolation and quarantine of persons who have been exposed to, or currently have, the illness.

What health officials can do to protect children

The CDC classifies vaccines as one of the top 10 public health achievements. The vast majority (about 98%) of parents across the U.S. as a whole comply with the state law mandated schedule of vaccines for their children.

Vaccines, like any other FDA-approved product such as a prescription drug or medical device, carry a set of risks and benefits. These calculations vary depending on the vaccine, its efficacy, safety, potential side effects, the severity of the illness the vaccine aims to protect against, and the individual to whom it is administered.

Vaccine science and practice similarly evolved with historical mistakes (the Cutter incident) and ongoing disputes about risks and benefits for individual vaccines like flu and anthrax.

To promote vaccination for children, health officials may offer educational campaigns and set up free clinics for parents to bring their children. State laws may also mandate vaccines as a condition for school attendance, or require excluding unvaccinated children during an active outbreak at their school.

However, if states offer a religious or nonmedical exemption, courts have been clear that health officials and school officials do not have discretion to require the child’s parent to identify with an organized religion or reject the sincerity of the parent’s beliefs because this violates the First Amendment.

Public health professionals worry that parents who forgo vaccination are placing their child and the community at risk. Some have advocated that the state should step in with coercive measures such as eliminating any nonmedical exemptions for all children or intervene by force, such as classifying parents’ decision as child neglect or seeking a court order to vaccinate the child.

In my opinion, these strategies rely on a distortion of legal precedent, dismiss longstanding authority of parents to make decisions for their children, and threaten to undermine an already fractured public trust.

Cases that uphold state intervention to protect a child by compelling medical treatment generally require that the child has an illness, the illness is severe and life-threatening, and the risks and benefits of intervening are assessed.

This requires medical professionals and health officials to maintain precision in distinguishing whether the parents are deciding to forgo recommended vaccines, or whether they are refusing medical care for a critically ill child. Indeed, a recent case in Chandler, Arizona, demonstrated how a climate of coercion and force may result in parental fear and refusal to constructively engage with state officials for even an ill child.

State public health officials have the duty to protect residents from illness and communicable disease, but these strategies must fall within appropriate legal parameters. Dismissing these legal boundaries or justifying unnecessary force not only undermines fundamental liberties, but in my view fuels parental and community distrust of health officials and sets back the ultimate goals of protecting the public.",mainstream,M0aa09,vaccine
27,756,"Pathogens are microbes that cause diseases . Vaccines allow a dead or altered form of the disease causing pathogen to be introduced into the body, which contain a specific antigen . This causes the immune system, specifically the white blood cells , to produce complementary antibodies , which target and attach to the antigen. When a white blood cell engulfs and digests a pathogen it is called phagocytosis.

During the primary infection the antibodies slowly increase, peak at around ten days and then gradually decrease. A second exposure to the same pathogen causes the white blood cells to respond quickly in order to produce lots of the relevant antibodies, which prevents infection.",mainstream,M07fd6,vaccine
28,887,"A teenager who made headlines for getting vaccinated despite his family's wishes has testified about his experience to US lawmakers.

Ethan Lindenberger, from Ohio, sought immunisations aged 18 after turning to the internet for advice.

Federal data suggests the proportion of US children under two not being immunised has quadrupled since 2001.

Doctors at the hearing blamed online misinformation and discredited science for scaring parents away from vaccines.

Mr Lindenberger, who is still a senior in high school, spoke on Tuesday at the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions alongside four doctors who are experts in the field.

He said much of his mother's opposition to routine vaccines came from fear they could cause side-effects like brain damage or autism.

In 1998, a study by a British doctor Andrew Wakefield incorrectly linked the MMR (Measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine to autism. His research has since been completely discredited and Mr Wakefield has been struck off - but the theory has endured within the global anti-vaccination community.
• 'Don't be taken in by social media vaccine myths'

All four doctors at Tuesday's hearing echoed that there was ""absolutely no evidence"" that exists which supports the link.

This is also affirmed in new Danish research released on Tuesday. The study examined 650,000 children over 10 years and categorically concludes that MMR does not increase the risk of autism or trigger it in those susceptible.

Mr Lindenbenger, doctors and members of Congress at the hearing all pointed out the internet fuels the spread of misinformation.

""My mother would turn to anti-vax groups online and social media rather than health officials and critical sources,"" the teenager told the hearing.

He also pointed out his mother's decision had come from concern, not malice.

""There's a lot of emotional appeals talking about families, children and appealing to a parent's love, and manipulating that to convince them vaccines are dangerous,"" he told the hearing about the nature of online posts.

""That's the issue I take. I have tried to convey to my parents I don't think they are stupid for believing that, but people are very convincing and that's very dangerous.""

Mr Lindenberger's story went viral in late 2018 when he asked online forum Reddit about the subject.

At one point during Tuesday's hearing, Republican Senator Johnny Isakson joked that he would ""love"" to be a guest at the Linderberger family home for Thanksgiving dinner.

""Would be a heck of a discussion everybody would have,"" he said about the family's public disagreement.

Health experts have long warned about the risk posed by parents who do not vaccinate.

They say the decision affects not only their families but everyone else because high vaccination rates are integral to keep communities protected.

This concept, which is known as herd immunity, offers protection for people like newborns and people with auto-immune diseases who are not able to be vaccinated.

The US has been battling a number of outbreaks of preventable diseases in recent years.

Senator Patty Murray, from Washington state, spoke at the hearing about a recent measles outbreak in her local Clark County where 70 cases have been confirmed.

Less than 80% of nursery-age children were immunised there in 2017 - well below the target rate of about 95% for herd immunity.

At Tuesday's hearing, doctors implored the federal government to increase funding for vaccine education. They also asked state lawmakers to increase limits on non-medical vaccination exemptions for parents.

California is one state that has already cracked down on exemptions, following an outbreak of measles linked to Disneyland in 2015.

Similar outbreaks are not isolated to the US - there have been increases recorded elsewhere around the world.

In 2018, Europe saw three times more measles case than the year before.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) have blamed growing vaccine hesitancy for the outbreaks.

29,351,"The best ways to convince people of the benefits of vaccinations may be to show them pictures of a child with measles or to have them read a description of the disease written by a mom whose child was infected, according to a new study.

These ways are more effective than showing people information summarizing recent research that shows there is no link between vaccines and an increased risk of autism in children, the researchers found.

The researchers found that directing people's attention to the risks posed by not getting vaccinated by showing them the pictures of sick children and having them read a mom's written account of her child's disease changed their attitudes, leading them to think more positively about vaccinations, study author Zachary Horne, a graduate student at the University of Illinois, said in a statement.

That was true for even ""the most skeptical participants in the study,"" Horne said.

There were 644 cases of measles in the United States in 2014, according to the study. That's triple the number seen in 2013. And back in 2000, researchers thought that this disease had been eliminated from the U.S., according to the study. [5 Dangerous Vaccine Myths]

""The re-emergence of measles has been linked to an increase in the number of parents refusing to vaccinate their children,"" the researchers wrote in their study. One reason that parents don't vaccinate their children is the mistaken belief that the vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella (the MMR vaccine) is linked with an increased risk of autism. Researchers have been looking for effective ways to convince people who hold this mistaken belief about the benefits of vaccinations.

In the new study, the researchers asked 315 people questions to examine their views on several potentially controversial subjects, including their attitudes toward vaccines and their willingness to vaccinate their kids.

Then, the people in the study were assigned to one of three groups. People in the first group looked at science-based materials that challenged the anti-vaccination point of view. People in the second group read a paragraph written by a mother describing her child's infection with measles, and also looked at pictures of children with measles, mumps or rubella. They also read three warnings about why it is important to vaccinate kids. People in the third group, which was a comparison group, were asked to read about a subject not related to vaccines.

Then, the researchers again evaluated the people's views on vaccination and their intentions to vaccinate their children in the future. The investigators found that the intervention that involved showing people the consequences of the diseases was the one that had the biggest effect on the people who were initially the most skeptical about vaccinations, Horne said.

In contrast, showing people the scientific evidence that there is no link between vaccines and autism did not change the people's views on vaccination, the researchers said. The reason this type of intervention doesn't work is likely that trying to convince someone that his or her beliefs are false is not the best argumentative strategy, Horne said.

The study shows that ""instead of going up against the belief about the link between vaccines and autism,"" researchers should aim to convince people that, independent of whether they believe in that link, they should also believe that there are serious consequences of not getting children vaccinated, Horne told Live Science.

""The insight [from the study] was to direct their attention towards those consequences, rather than trying to combat their false beliefs that there is some link where there is not,"" Horne said.

The new study was published today (Aug. 3) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

 birthday and a second dose when they are aged three years and four months old.

Measles is a viral infection which is spread from person to person. Symptoms of measles include:

Symptoms can last up to 10 days in children and longer in adults. The infection can cause serious complications.

Mumps is caused by a virus. Symptoms for most people are:
• painful swollen glands in the face and neck

Symptoms last up to 10 days. The condition can also cause complications.

Rubella is a mild viral disease, also known as German measles.
• None swollen glands behind the ear and the back of the neck

Some adults also have painful joints. The infection is very serious in pregnancy.

It is important to protect children against measles, mumps and rubella as these diseases can have serious complications.

In some cases, measles can cause death. In children aged under two years, one child in 8,000 will develop a fatal degenerative brain condition within eight years of getting measles.
• deafness - usually with partial or complete recovery

Rubella can cause inflammation of the brain and can affect blood clotting. In pregnant women, it can cause miscarriage or major health problems for their babies such as:

MMR vaccine protects your child against measles, mumps and rubella. They get the vaccine in two doses:

Experts from around the world, including the World Health Organization (WHO), agree that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

Separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are not recommended. Single vaccines put children at risk while they wait between each vaccine. It also means that children need repeat injections and are more at risk of adverse reactions at the injection site.

• Understanding the Basics: General Best Practice Guidelines on Immunization",mainstream,M0a2d8,vaccine
32,1319,"In response to outbreaks of measles in France and Italy, resulting from a growing trend for parents to refuse vaccinations for their children, authorities have announced plans to make childhood immunisation compulsory. Last week, a newspaper editorial demanded similar measures in Britain, insisting that parental refusal of immunisation “should not be tolerated”.

Though I have been actively involved over the past decade in promoting the MMR vaccine in face of claims of a link with autism, I hope British immunisation authorities will continue to resists calls for compulsion.

As the father of a child with autism who was also as a GP administering vaccinations to babies, I read with great interest Andrew Wakefield’s now notorious 1998 study in the The Lancet suggesting a link between MMR and autism. It was immediately obvious that though this paper presented no evidence for this link, it would cause undue alarm among parents of children with autism as well as among parents of children due for vaccinations.

In response I wrote the first of a series of articles, culminating in 2004 in a book MMR and Autism: What Parents Need To Know. This book sought to reassure parents that they had no grounds to fear that MMR had caused their children’s autism, and that it offered effective protection against serious diseases. It was a great relief when Wakefield’s work was finally exposed as fraudulent and he departed Britain to join a wacky fringe of conspiracy theorists and alternative health cranks in the United States.",mainstream,M0bec3,vaccine.autism
0,903,"Those watching President Trump’s rally in Tampa on Tuesday couldn’t help but be exposed to a fringe movement that discusses several loosely connected and vaguely defined — and baseless — conspiracy theories.

In one shot on Fox News, the president was partially obscured by a sign in the crowd reading “We Are Q.” In another shot during the president’s speech, a sign promoting the debunked Seth Rich conspiracy theory, with the hashtag #Qanon, came into focus in the center of the screen. Some attendees wore T-shirts with a blocky Q. Others held up signs with the letter.

They were all self-described “followers of Q,” an anonymous person or group of people who claim to be privy to government secrets. That supposedly classified information has been revealed on the 4chan and 8chan message boards and spread around mainstream internet platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Q has attracted people — the exact number is hard to know — eager to consume his “bread crumbs,” or new details in a sprawling web of conspiracy theories.

Just give me the basics so I can minimally understand what’s going on

1,921,"After years of deflection and foot-dragging, the major tech companies are finally having to take steps toward policing their own content.

They have reached this point kicking and screaming, under great public pressure, after clinging for years to the fiction that they are just public utilities and that people can use their pipes for pretty much anything.

But now they have united, for a brief moment at least, against a major conspiracy theorist.

Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify have all taken action against Alex Jones.

They are deathly afraid of being accused of political bias, sometimes for good reason. Both Facebook and Twitter have both grappled with incidents of discrimination against conservatives, which may have made them gun-shy about banning (as opposed to shadow-banning) some folks.

But almost in unison, the tech giants teamed up against Jones, who runs Infowars.

Candidate Donald Trump appeared on Jones' online show in 2015, and yesterday Jones tweeted a video defense with the headline: ""EMERGENCY: President Trump Must Defend the First Amendment.""

Facebook said it has taken down some Jones pages ""for glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.""

Apple said it removed the ""Alex Jones Show"" and other podcasts from iTunes and its podcast app. The company said it ""does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users.""

Google’s YouTube dropped the ax on Jones' channel, telling The Washington Post that it terminates users who violate ""our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures.""

And Spotify banned Jones altogether after earlier removing some podcasts, telling the Post: ""We take reports of hate content seriously and review any podcast episode or song that is flagged by our community.""

I know Jones has a lot of fans—remember the controversy swirling around his interview with Megyn Kelly—but he's also a guy being sued by Sandy Hook parents for saying that the horrible massacre at that Connecticut school was a hoax.

Jones apologized last year, in careful language, for spreading the phony Pizzagate conspiracy theory, saying he'd been given inaccurate information.

That’s not ""conservative."" That's at odds with reality.

Jones texted the Post that being banned by the tech companies was ""a counter-strike against the global awakening.""

""We've seen a giant yellow journalism campaign with thousands and thousands of articles for weeks, for months misrepresenting what I've said and done to set the precedent to de-platform me before Big Tech and the Democratic Party as well as some Republican establishment types move against the First Amendment in this country as we know it,"" he said.

Separately, Jones called The New York Times a ""globalist intelligence agency"" and said that the ""evil, wicked sociopaths"" who work for major media outlets were teaming up to take down Infowars.

I confess I'd like to know how the four tech companies happened to take action on the same day. Perhaps they concluded there was safety in numbers. They seemed to have an ally in Drudge, whose banner headline was ""APPLE REGULATES HATE.""

But this is just a skirmish. Just recently, Mark Zuckerberg got himself into trouble by saying he saw no reason to ban pages by Holocaust deniers.

There is a fine line between banning hate and bullying on one hand and censoring controversial political opinions on the other. These battles will play out in a hyperpartisan political atmosphere. But for now, Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify have all agreed there is one person who falls on the wrong side of that line.",mainstream,M15f1b,pizzagate

ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: If you only knew what comes on right before the camera comes up. Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juab Williams, Melissa Francis and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is ""The Five.""

Well, we have some breaking news on the Trump transition. Rudy Giuliani is out of consideration for an administration position. We're going to hear from the former mayor in a few minutes. But first, this news comes on a very busy day for president-elect Trump.

Mr. Trump starting off his morning with a face to face meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan at Trump Tower followed by a Get-Out-the-Vote event in Baton Rouge, and now Mr. Trump is headed to Grand Rapids, Michigan, for the next step on his thank you tour kicking off in about a couple hours from now. One common theme in the president-elect speeches, his plan to bring jobs back to America. He doubled down on his promise during a speech in Louisiana this afternoon. Take a listen.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: It's time to get help for the American people. We're going to get them into the labor market and they're going to do a great job and they're going to make good money. We're going to rebuild our country with American hands by American workers.

My administration will follow two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. OK? We have so many companies right now -- I think probably if I would have said a couple of months ago we have so many companies negotiating to leave, I don't think they're negotiating so fast right now.

BOLLING: All right KG, He promised to make America great again by bringing jobs back to America and keeping American jobs in America. Seems to be keeping his promise.

KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yes, I love it, and also a perfect location and venue to make this kind of speech to connect with the people, the forgotten men and women, the working class people that wanted someone to hear them and put them back to work and put money in their pockets and food on their table.

American cars made by American hands on the streets across this country. I think it's fantastic. This is why people joined his movement and carried him into the White House to try to get this done. And perfect timing as well, of course, with the lawsuits now being dropped for the recount here as well so, it's fantastic.

BOLLING: And also, there's an election tomorrow, that last senate seat is up for gaps tomorrow. Juan, early this morning, Andy Puzder was named or at least tapped to run the Labor Department. Guy has 75,000 people working for him. Seems to me a logical, wise choice to run labor.

JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: So, no problem with the ladies in bikinis selling hamburgers? You have no problem with this?

BOLLING: So you're talking about the ""Carl's Jr."""" commercials --

WILLIAMS: Yes, I see a lot of feminist --

BOLLING: It's one of the restaurants --

WILLIAMS: Yes, they're not happy. So, but the real argument is that this is a guy who at a time of populist anger about income inequality is opposed to raising the minimum wage, also opposed to the idea that more Americans should be made eligible to receive overtime pay and wants to do away with that Obama era regulation.

BOLLING: Can I just check you on that one.

BOLLING: Andy Puzder supports president Trump. President-elect Trump's minimum wage raises that are ""rational and do not destroy jobs or the businesses supporting them.""

MELISSA FRANCIS, CO-HOST: Well, I think the difference is that he's a job creator not a job killer. And that he realizes that changing the federal minimum wage is putting a mandate on employers that doesn't necessarily make sense. I mean, saying that he isn't in favor of labor is like saying that a general doesn't love his troops.

I mean he's a guy that goes out there and expands business, builds it bigger. He understands what makes it tick. He is highly dependent on labor. I think he loves the guys that work for him and he's a great choice. He understands exactly how business works and how to expand it.

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Are you talking about Andy Puzder? The guy that said that if he had his way he would automate his entire company because robots don't need health care, robots don't sue, robots don't do the slip and pay or whatever you call it?

GUTFELD: Slip and fall -- you're the lawyer. I tried it on you and it never works.

GURFELD: He employs 75,000 people, but on the whole, he would rather employ none. And by the way, I think it's a great choice. I think Puzder is a smart guy. I think he is smart on minimum wage. I think he's smart on overtime, but he's also smart on the realities of automation.

FRANCIS: He wants to automate. I mean who doesn't? He loves automation, grat.

GUTFELD: That's my point. So, you're kind of talking out of both sides here.

FRANCIS: You're going to have no employees at all. No, I'm not. You have to have automation in a business. He wants to keep the employees that he has.

GUTFELD: You're pulling away though. It's fast food.

FRANCIS: It's productive. Yes, you can't stop time. I mean --

BOLLING: Yes, that's my point, you can't. But what if you decided to punish time or punish progress?

BOLLING: But he is also the guy who is in favor of Donald Trump -- president-elect Trump's border policy as well.

BOLLING: Where there are a lot of illegal immigrants who are taking these fast food jobs that Americans could be taking. He promises to implement the agenda.

GUTFELD: I think that's a relatively new thing for Puzder. I think Puzder was definitely into cheap labor up until recently.

BOLLING: Well, I do not think he's for cheap labor. I mean, no.

GUTFELD: I think he was for open borders.

WILLIAMS: So, and let me say for all of our talk at this table -- and I'm worried about your job at the moment given your position here --

WILLIAMS: I think -- let's ask labor. Let's ask the people who run the AFL-CIO. They say this man fights workers. This man is hell on workers.

BOLLING: Juan, you call labor -- big picture labor -- the 11 million people who are in the unions? That's who you call labor? How about the other 130 million Americans who are working who aren't unionized who are against everything union?

WILLIAMS: Against everything (ph). I don't think that's true. I think what you're saying true, is there are fewer and fewer Americans who are in unions from the private sector --

BOLLING: It's 11 million. You know, that's 53 million workforce.

WILLIAMS: Because, look, wages have been going down. People are struggling at times for jobs --

WILLIAMS: No, but what I'm telling you is, big labor is not stupid. This is like the attack on Chuck Jones the other day by Trump.

BOLLING: Big labor is stupid. They are pricing themselves out of the market.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, they are.

GUILFOYLE: Because they're greedy and yes, when you are in a party pig like that.

GUTFELD: But you know what? The choice of Puzder is telling you what the future is. The future is automation. So all of this stuff about saving 1,000 jobs here and 1,000 there, it's not going to stop automation, well, that's artificial intelligence. It's not.

FRANCIS: No, but can I tell you what the difference is though? The automated factory is going to stay here because when it comes down to where they want to have their factory -- I mean, of course, CEO's would rather have it here. They can keep a closer eye on production.

They know that the workers that are there are more efficient, are better. They need lower cost regulation, lower taxes, cheaper energy because we are drill, drill, drill. And they'd rather have the factory here. Yes, the factory is going to have fewer workers but you need some workers to run alongside those robots.

FRANCIS: But it would be better than having the factories in China where they can't keep an eye on it where a bunch of products are so much --

GUTFELD: So you would say it's okay to apply tariffs to a company to keep them from going to China?

FRANCIS: No, I think that's he's opening salvo and then negotiation. I think he's saying we're going to throw this tariff on and I think that that's how you reset the negotiation. I don't believe it would ever come to that or he would actually do that. But if God knows like it's going to, don't tell anyone (inaudible) that he's not going to actually do that but I think he is.

BOLLING: And the Carrier deal, that was a threat, but I'm not sure that they stayed or these jobs -- the 800 stayed because of that. I think it was because it was a good deal to stay tax-wise. They got tax breaks. They got incentives. They got investment and if --

WILLIAMS: What did Sarah Palin call it? Crony capitalism.

BOLLING: And she was right.

WILLIAMS: What did George Will say? Socialism.

BOLLING: I would say George Will is completely off his game. I think George Will at that time was --

GUTFELD: Why? You can't say that. He's right. He's talking about the (inaudible) of free market principal.

BOLLING: The free market principals say if you lower taxes, more corporations will hire more people.

GUTFELD: Yes. But then you don't need coercion to go along with that. You're saying lower taxes as the carrot for the stick.

BOLLING: But he never -- he hasn't coerced anyone. He's not even president yet. He can't coerce anyone at all.

GUTFELD: So he never brought up 35 percent tariff?

BOLLING: He brought it up and he didn't coerce. What he did was secure --

GUTFELD: That's a threat. He did say it was a threat.

BOLLING: Right. He secured millions of dollars of tax incentives. That is what --

WILLIAMS: And Carrier secured millions of dollars of --

BOLLING: Hold on. All right, hold on guys

FRANCIS: It's their money, their money.

BOLLING: Who is the governor of Indiana?

WILLIAMS: Why wouldn't the next guy say give me some of that?

BOLLING: Of course they should and hopefully they get it.

WILLIAMS: This is not a system, an economic system --

BOLLING: Do this. This is a great idea.

WILLIAMS: Eric, this is what they call picking winners and losers.

FRANCIS: No, it's not.

FRANCIS: Why are you against companies keeping their own money? It's not taxpayer money. It's Carrier's money --

WILLIAMS: Oh, well, go for it. Well, then they don't need Indiana's money?

WILLIAMS: Why are they asking for Indiana's money?

FRANCIS: It's their money. They earn profits for giving less of it to the government.

GUILFOYLE: OK, business 101 during the break.

BOLLING: OK, let's do this. As we mentioned earlier, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has removed his name from consideration for a position in the Trump administration, even though he is no longer a contender for a cabinet position. The transition team says Giuliani may join the team at a later date. Giuliani spoke about it moments ago.

RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: My desire to be in the cabinet was great, but it wasn't that great. And he had a lot of terrific candidates and I thought I could play a better role being on the outside. That was the only one I had any real interest in.

BOLLING: So, we bring it around KG. Rudy said -- the former mayor says he pulled himself out of contention. What do you think?

GUILFOYLE: And he did that on the 29th. Removed himself from contention and wrote a letter that they did not want to accept at first because they still wanted to keep him in consideration. He always said that he would be there for this candidate, for president-elect Trump. He was.

He was a very important surrogate on his behalf and very loyal. I'm sure he's going to continue very strongly to be an adviser. Anyone would be lucky to have Rudy Giuliani in any capacity. There are a number of roles he could have fulfilled beautifully in the cabinet so, you know.

Obviously, I'd love to see him serving the country but he's got a very busy life, very active life and with his wife, Judith. So, he's got a lot of options. Let's see what happens.

BOLLING: What about deputy? No one wants to be the deputy?

GUTFELD: Yes, nobody wants to be the deputy. They all want to be the sheriff. Is that how it works? But anyway, he's a great guy. He's like our Churchill in a way. I mean, he was an inspiring person. I hate to say was but I feel like he's retiring and he's pulling back. But he can still be one lucky guy at outnumbered.

GUTFELD: He will be back here.

GUILFOYLE: Well, he just got an award in Colombia for reducing crime there just last night. I mean, you know, he's incredibly talented.

BOLLING: This is an important point. He does very -- his security company does very well internationally advising foreign countries on security.

FRANCIS: Maybe that would have been one of the challenges. I mean, that's one of the things that a lot of people talk about, is that in the process of a confirmation, that he has a lot of interests all around the world that could have been a challenge. He's America's mayor. We love him. What are you going to do?

GUILFOYLE: But he also was thoroughly vetted so, that process already was completed.

BOLLING: What do you make of all this?

GUILFOYLE: Well, I don't buy that he was fairly vetted. But I do buy this, that --

GUILFOYLE: He said it in the interview.

WILLIAMS: I know, well, I would say it, too. But I don't know if it's true. But I'm just saying, I think Rudy Giuliani could have been a great attorney general. I think in fact, he might have done better than Jeff Sessions, the senator from Alabama in terms of getting through.

But what strikes me is he was held on a string. If you remember, when we started these conversations, everybody assumed he was going to get the job. We don't know if he's qualified. Doesn't have a lot of foreign policy experience. But it was assumed he's going to get the job.

Then it starts to go Romney, Petraeus, Senator Corker and maybe he got tired of this game. I mean, he makes a lot of money now going overseas doing the things Kimberly was talking about, giving speeches.

BOLLING: All right. They want us to leave it right there. A programming note, tune in to Fox News Sunday for an exclusive interview with president- elect Donald Trump. Check your local listings.

But up next here, disturbing new details about this illegal immigrant on the run after -- on the run, I'm sorry, after allegedly killing two women in Kentucky. How Mr. Trump's tough immigration stance might fix problems like this when we come right back.

GUILFOYLE: Is this the exact problem Mr. Trump is trying to fix? This man you see on your screen, an illegal immigrant from Mexico is wanted for allegedly killing two people in a hit and run case in Kentucky. Guess what? He has been deported eight times. At his thank you tour stop in Iowa last night, president-elect Donald Trump reiterated his campaign pledge to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration.

TRUMP: On immigration, we will build the wall and we will put an end to illegal immigration and stop the drugs from pouring into our country. The drugs are pouring into our country, poisoning our youth and plenty of other people.

A Trump administration will stop the violence that is spilling across our border. And believe me, you've seen now, it is unbelievable how much there is.

GUILFOYLE: OK, so a strong messaging but this is consistent, Melissa, with during the campaign, what he talked about, cracking down on illegal immigration, cracking down on sanctuary cities that would have these people come in, revolving doors to come in to re-offend as criminal recidivist, much like this man did, and then deported eight times. What an insufficient broken system.

FRANCIS: Yes. No, I mean, this has become the issue. Of course, there are so many cities saying they're going to be sanctuary cities here in New York. Mayor de Blasio having a commercial in the back of taxis talking about how proud he is that he's refusing to cooperate with the feds.

I heard Greg say it before and it was so right, that the wall is like the red shiny bike under the Christmas tree, and God help him if the kids come down in the morning for Christmas and that bike isn't there. I mean, this is something that if he fails on this campaign promise, it's really tough.

At the same time, when people are so literal with the wall -- I mean he also said -- remember every time he said the big beautiful wall, he said with a giant beautiful door in the middle, like, do you really think there's going to be a giant door in the middle? I don't think it's quite as literal. Like a giant -- it's going to swing open --

FRANCIS: A giant brass knob on the big door and you open it up and you follow through?

GUTFELD: There's going to be a doggie door too for Jasper.

FRANCIS: I don't think it's quite as literal, but I agree with Greg that if it doesn't happen, yikes.

BOLLING: I think it's literal. I think he means what he says.

FRANCIS: With a big door? Is there a knocker?

BOLLING: No, no, no. I think he will build a wall. I mean, this is a brilliant idea. Not only to fulfill a campaign promise, but it also -- it's a massive infrastructure. You want to talk about trade and --

BOLLING: It's a massive infrastructure program that you could put a lot of people to work. And like he said, they're putting ways to make Mexico pay for it. Can we be a little (inaudible) down (inaudible). Here's an interesting opportunity for Andy Puzder to do something that Republicans haven't been able to do or aren't willing to do -- is to go after the companies who employ illegals as well.

BOLLING: Not only deport illegals when you catch them or put the wall up, but if a company like a fast food restaurant is employing illegal aliens, you penalize them. You make them pay for that. Now, this has not been a very conservative talking point, but I think Andy Puzder is the guy. If he is going do it, boy, this would be an opportunity to do it.

GUILFOYLE: Pretty exciting. OK, Juan, are you recovering from Bolling's comments yet?

WILLIAMS: Well, I just think -- I really appreciate that you shouldn't take him literally on the wall. There might be a door. I think he said in some areas there might be a fence. We'll get to it. I mean, I just think, look, this is a waste of money, waste of time. If you're looking for jobs, Eric, there's so much that we need in terms of infrastructure in the country.

I would hope that we can do other more meaningful projects. But what concerns me, Kimberly, the demonization of all illegal aliens because of the crimes committed by this one man. He has been deported several times. I think the case that Bill O'Reilly talks about all the time in San Francisco is even a better example because that guy just freshly got out of jail.

But you can't, it seems to me, connect crime and illegal immigrants in any significant way because, in fact, crime has gone down. Violent crime has gone down even when immigration -- illegal immigration is going up.

BOLLING: The incidence of violent crimes is higher among the illegal --

WILLIAMS: That's not true. That's absolutely not true.

BOLLING: According to the FBI in --

WILLIAMS: No, no. What the FBI says is you have more illegal immigrant -- I think its 37 percent illegal immigrants in jail.

WILLIAMS: But you know why they're in jail, Eric? Not violent crime. They're in for immigration violations.

BOLLING: They commit crimes at a higher rate than the population.

GUILFOYLE: No, no, no. They are not in there for immigration violations.

GUTFELD: You know what amazes me? Can you show the picture of the guy?

GUTFELD: What drives me crazy, if you take a look at this fellow, illegal alien deported eight times is well fed. He's just well fed. I mean, if this is how our country operates. He has been deported eight times. That's once every six weeks. He gets deported more times than I get a haircut.

For him it's like running a 5k if he actually exercised. So the problem here isn't just that he's an illegal alien. It's that there are no consequences for the incompetence or the supervisory incompetence. It may not be the officers.

And maybe that they're told not to stop this, and if they're told not to stop that, that has to be addressed. There has to be a punishment for the incompetence so that this doesn't happen.

BOLLING: They are told not to stop this. They are sanctuary city.

GUILFOYLE: It is. It's a hundred percent to -- I'm telling you. I lived there. I worked there. I rented (ph) there and I'm telling you that you'd go in as a prosecutor into court and you would be the bad guy.

The prosecutor of the White House is a bad guy because he would ask the person on the other side of the table there to please identify yourself by your true name. And they would give you about 16 different aliases, lie about everything. You'd have to run them through the print system. Find out they have a hold.

And then the public defender would just try to get them out and then specifically not turn them over to ICE so they can come back into my courtroom again with another DUI or another criminal offense. They are not in the criminal system for an immigration violation, trust me.

WILLIAMS: There's any and every community which you can find criminality. But let me just say, speaking for big business -- can you imagine me speaking for big business? Big business, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mike Bloomberg -- so many of the big corporations from Disney to Marriott (ph) are all saying that if Donald Trump goes ahead with this deportation force, it will devastate the American economy.

GUTFEDLD: OK, but we're talking about the specific examples of criminality and whether the criminality is worse or better among illegal aliens. If you have that person deported, that crime is committed, you should start calling him the deportables.

GUILFYLE: And here we go.

GUILFOYLE: And just on a quick programming note here, we're unclear as to why that individual looks well fed. He also could have a thyroid issue.

GUTFELD: Oh, we'll treat that. We'll treat that coming up.

GUILFOYLE: Directly ahead, Hillary Clinton takes aim at fake news. It's her warning about spreading false information. Legitimate or just an excuse for losing the election? Details, next.

WILLIAMS: Welcome back. In her first speech since losing the election, Hillary Clinton is sounding the alarm about the dangers of so-called fake news. This comes after online conspiracy stories involving her campaign sparked some violence.

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Fake news can have real world consequences. This isn't about politics or partisanship. Lives are at risk. Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs. It's imperative that leaders in both the private sector and the public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives.

WILLIAMS: With recent incidents like the Pizzagate incident in Washington, D.C. and most recently in Brooklyn, New York, does Clinton have a point? Greg, I want to go to you on this because it's not only Hillary Clinton. I mean several people are increasingly talking about this danger, even the Pope is saying this is --

GUTFELD: All right, first of all, this is a real story. Forget Hillary. We don't need to hear from her on this because I don't trust anything she says. Fox News should be talking about this because this is about news and this is a serious, serious problem. The poison of Pizzagate is that it shifted the burden of proof on to the accused.

If somebody calls you a child molester, it's up to them to provide the proof. They can't call you -- then you're returning to the Salem witch trials where you take a witch and you throw in the water, and if she drowns, she's not a witch. That's the mentality we are dealing with on the internet.

We now have parents of Sandy Hook children getting phone calls and death threats from people because they believe that Sandy Hook is a false flag operation. There has -- we are returning to the McMartin preschool era where you just say somebody is a pedophile and you ruin their lives. There has to be consequences for any of these people. You get -- the FBI should investigating these people and they should be sued for slander and libel. Do whatever is possible.

These small businesses that are being abused by these weirdos, they need to be able to have some action, some action to get back at this. I don't think Hillary helps because she politicizes this.

WILLIAMS: She has a legitimate right to --

GUTFELD: Fox News should be talking about this, not Hillary.

WILLIAMS: I agree with you, but you know, you have people who tweet us stuff like, until this story is proven false, it's a story.

WILLIAMS: That's crazy. That's what you are saying. Melissa, let me come to you. I read a story the other day that indicated this is not just a problem because, you know, some guy takes a gun into a Ping Pong Pizza in D.C., but it's a problem because people who are just trying to know what's going on in the world get confused and they no longer know what's trustworthy. It distorts the entire world of news.

FRANCIS: I guess. But I mean, what's the remedy? How do you police something like this? I mean, I understand the extreme example. But it's like, with people putting out stories, you need some common sense.

I mean, I feel like, when somebody is sharing a story that's ludicrous, I don't just believe it based on that somebody forwarded it in their Twitter or they booked it in their Facebook. I think they're a moron. You know I mean? You watch it and you look at it, and you're like, this can't possibly be true. Why -- why would I believe it? I mean, I just...

GUTFELD: There's an entire group of people who are pushing a story, pushing a pernicious, toxic story that are hurting people. There should be some retribution.

WILLIAMS: So Eric, let me come to you on this point. In the story that I read, it said there are lots of people, particularly on the right -- and I've heard this from Greg -- who take delight in the idea that there's someone picking on the liberals, someone who's saying they're up to nasty stuff, and so what if it's a little not true? They're still punching back at the left.

BOLLING: This is a big, big problem. And I think the only solution is Greg is right, have the legitimate news services get out in front of it and talk about it. And I'll tell you what it does do. It drives people to FOX News, CNN, ABC, NBC and stop reading these things that randomly pop up.

The problem is, some of them look like us. Some of them...

BOLLING: ... are putting logos that look a lot like...

BOLLING: ... our logos. Of course. But again, free speech, I get it. But when you're infringing on copyright -- there's also another issue, too. When you're a public figure, I think you forego your rights of being -- of suing for libel and slander. So when you're hitting Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton has some sort of pedophilia thing going on with the pizza - - pizza place in D.C., she doesn't really -- she's not covered under the law. But the average citizen is.

BOLLING: The pizza guy is. He's not a public figure yet, and so he should be.

BOLLING: Who do you sue?

GUTFELD: You have to get the names of the -- they found -- they found one woman who was behind the Pizzagate story who published it on her website, finally.

BOLLING: Sue the Internet provider that hosts the story, not the person that posts it. Or both.

FRANCIS: I mean, I -- I agree with the sentiment of what you're saying.

GUTFELD: Like shouting ""fire"" in a theater. Right?

FRANCIS: It's -- but it's -- realistically, how do you deal with this? I mean, so then you go after the Internet provider. I mean, that's...

WILLIAMS: It's terrible. Let me -- let me...

FRANCIS: Then they've got to police everything that's going on all over the Internet?

WILLIAMS: I want to talk to...

WILLIAMS: I want to talk to Ms. Guilfoyle, the lawyer, if you'll allow me.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, the lawyer. Twenty seconds, the lawyer.

Please. Go to a real lawyer. Not a fake lawyer.

WILLIAMS: Will you give Ms. Guilfoyle the table?

WILLIAMS: We -- Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is now asking Facebook users to help him find fake stories. Google says they're going to stop placing ads. But ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported just today, they said, ""You know what? Fake news is making tens of thousands of dollars because the big companies don't know that their ads are on these sites. The computers are automatically placing these ads. And so they're supporting fake news sites.

GUILFOYLE: Right. Well, obviously, they have to be a little bit more, you know, vigilant about researching and vetting the sites that they're involved with and make sure this doesn't happen. So it has to have a multifaceted approach. Right? You've got to do this thing. It's like Jeff [SIC] Zuckerberg is doing over there at Facebook.

GUILFOYLE: Mark Zuckerberg is doing over there to make sure that they're, in fact, checking it all out. Right? But at the same time, people also use some of their common sense to not be fooled by it.

And on a third note, Hillary Clinton is just trying to continue to make and find excuses for why she lost the election, even though she was a horrible candidate and herself being no stranger to creating fake news stories, like when she lied about Benghazi and said over the caskets of four Americans.

GUTFELD: Or the bullets in -- with getting hit by fire.

WILLIAMS: I won't go into that.

All right. When we come back, new questions about conflicts of interest for President-elect Trump. This time, for his ties to ""Celebrity Apprentice."" Oh, my goodness. Details coming up next.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of times it falls on the project managers. But, you know, I did come up with the jingle, but I want to stay here. I want to win.

DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: OK. But you wrote the jingle?

FRANCIS: President-elect Donald Trump will not be firing anyone else from NBC's ""Celebrity Apprentice."" In fact, Mr. Trump is keeping his title as executive producer of the reality show after he takes office. The series is returning after a two-year hiatus, hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In the meantime, Kellyanne Conway is pushing back against the hypocrisy of critics who are slamming the move as a potential conflict of interest.

KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISOR: Were we so concerned about the hours and hours and hours spent on the golf course of the current president? I mean, presidents have a right to do things in their spare time or their leisure time. I mean, nobody objects to that.

Whether it's President Obama or Donald Trump, the idea that these men are going to be all work and nothing else all the time, it's just unrealistic, because it's never happened in our lifetime.

FRANCIS: Kimberly, what's the potential conflict of interest here? That he's going to suddenly start liking ""SNL,"" because they're on the same network?

GUILFOYLE: There you go. Conflict of interest. He's going to have to all of a sudden think Alec Baldwin is very, very funny.

I mean, yes, I think they're going to check this out legally to make sure that there isn't any impropriety. If there were, then he would have to not have the executive producer title. So so far, I think this is clean. Maybe perhaps it's somewhat unconventional. But it is not, my dear friend, illegal.

FRANCIS: See, I think this is a decoy. This is like the shiny ball that he, you know, holds up in front of the crowd to distract you. Because it doesn't make any sense to be talking about this necessarily. I mean, executive producer, it's like a candy that they give out now to actors when they're not really -- you know, I mean...

BOLLING: That's the point. I don't think many people understand what that means. That doesn't mean he's going to be on the phone going, ""Yes, I want to see this activity going on.""

BOLLING: No. You slap ""executive producer"" on almost everything. Watch a movie. At the end of a movie, when the credits start to roll...

BOLLING: Yes, there's 15. And, you know, most of them are the ones who donated to the film.

So I see nothing wrong with this. It's intellectual property. He developed the show.

GUILFOYLE: One or two.

BOLLING: It was created prior to ever announcing he wanted to run for president.

Barack Obama wrote a book before he was president. If that book was made into a movie, it would be the exact same thing. No one would ask him to take his name off...

WILLIAMS: What happened to the profits from the last book Obama did?

FRANCIS: We don't know he's getting paid for this, though. We don't know he's getting paid.

WILLIAMS: So here's the -- here's the...

WILLIAMS: Well, we do know that he's made millions already.

FRANCIS: Yes, but we don't know he's going to get paid this time.

WILLIAMS: Let me say the problem here -- I'm amazed that you guys don't see the problem of the potential for the chief executive of the United States taking a paycheck not from the American people.

FRANCIS: We don't know he's getting paid.

BOLLING: You don't know that.

WILLIAMS: Or taking credit, having an interest -- Kellyanne Conway says he's going to be spending time on this. I don't think that's legit.

And I think that when you look at the idea that, you know, he stands there and says, you know, ""I have spare time. I'll do this."" What if he says, you know, ""I don't know if I'm going to do an interview with NBC, because I want a better time slot for 'The Apprentice'""? That's a conflict of interest. Isn't it? By definition.

FRANCIS: Greg, aren't you the executive producer of this program?

GUTFELD: Little known fact, yes.

FRANCIS: I had no idea. What is your opinion on this?

GUTFELD: My opinion is, forget conflict of interest. Make it a conflict of interest. You know, if you win ""The Apprentice,"" you get -- your apprenticeship is in government. You get a job on the cabinet. If you lose, you go to Gitmo. And everybody who loses goes to Gitmo, because Gitmo is awesome.

BOLLING: Geraldo's right there. Just when you said that, Geraldo...

GUILFOYLE: Geraldo is going to Gitmo?

GUILFOYLE: Geraldo, thank you for the chocolates.

GUTFELD: ... Newt was on ""Cavuto"" earlier, and I like Newt, because he always says the honest thing. He just goes, ""It's weird."" Didn't he say, like, ""It's weird""? He was like, ""Why would he care? Why would he want it?"" He gets -- he asks everything.

GUILFOYLE: There's a reason behind it.

FRANCIS: I know. That's why I think it's a decoy.

BOLLING: He developed the show. It's near and dear to his heart.

GUILFOYLE: This is his other baby.

BOLLING: His kids were involved in developing the show.

BOLLING: It would be like...

GUILFOYLE: I think he thinks Arnold is going to do well.

BOLLING: ... would you want to take -- would you want to take your book away from you, your name and rights to the book, if you became president.

WILLIAMS: By the way, he's having a news conference next week, I think on next Thursday.

WILLIAMS: Trump is going to have a news conference, which he hasn't done - - hasn't had one since Hillary Clinton.

FRANCIS: He doesn't need to. He won.

WILLIAMS: He shouldn't talk to the American people and the press?

GUTFELD: It's an interesting problem to have. This is the first pop culture president.

GUTFELD: The first president that came directly from entertainment.

GUTFELD: This is a new problem.

GUILFOYLE: So truth in advertising and therefore...

FRANCIS: Greg will be the next one.

FRANCIS: All right. Don't go anywhere. ""Facebook Friday"" is up next.

GUTFELD: Yes. ""Facebook Friday,"" your questions answered. This is a great one. I'm going to start with you, Kimberly, go around.

GUTFELD: From Michelle K.: ""In memory of John Glenn, would any of you want to go to space and why?""

GUTFELD: Nope. Any -- any reason why?

GUILFOYLE: Because it would be really tough to catch all the salami upside down.

GUILFOYLE: Bad hair. I don't know. That kind of scares me a little bit, to be honest.

GUTFELD: Yes. What about you, Juan? I bet you'd go.

WILLIAMS: I'd love to go. You know, I'm curious about this tourism business...

WILLIAMS: ... because it seems a little extreme. But if you really are going to do something, that would be cool. Like, the other day Steven Hawkins said we're going to have to find a new planet in 1,000 years, because we're going to use this one up. Especially with Trump as president, doing away with the EPA.

GUTFELD: Way to work that in there.

WILLIAMS: So I would, yes. But the other reason is because I love movies. Right?

WILLIAMS: So I think Sigourney Weaver's probably up there with the aliens. Right? And Jodi Foster, didn't she do ""Contact""?

WILLIAMS: Yes, so I would like -- there's nice people in space.

GUTFELD: I don't think Jodi would be into you, though.

BOLLING: I don't think so either.

So apparently, Elon Musk says in 10 years, he'll have a space station...

BOLLING: ... up on the moon to go visit. I would like to. But you know what I would rather do?

BOLLING: I'd rather be Speed Racer. I would -- Spritle and Chim-Chim and racing Racer X in the Mach 5 when it would leap canyons.

GUTFELD: It would. It was pretty impressive.

BOLLING: I want to be Speed Racer.

WILLIAMS: I think we saw the child in you. That's wonderful.

FRANCIS: I am officially terrified. I would rather lay on the beach.

FRANCIS: Would you join me laying on the beach? We can do that together. Nice sand...

GUTFELD: But -- but that's the beauty. If you lay on the beach, technically you are in space. We are on a spaceship, Earth. We are throating in space.

GUTFELD: We are flying through space right now. Probably in a tiny spaceship, compared to a lot of other ones. The other issue is pooping.

GUTFELD: Not having that. I don't know how you do that in space. I mean, think about the problems.

GUTFELD: People have thought about it. How do you -- you know, things happen. It's floating over there. You know, all of a sudden it's up over there. You've got to chase it.

BOLLING: He's right. It's an issue.

GUILFOYLE: How did this happen?

GUTFELD: All right. Now we're going to go this way.

GUTFELD: From Robert G., when -- great question. ""When growing up,"" Melissa -- when you were growing up -- ""which celebrity posters or pictures did you have hanging on your wall?""

GUILFOYLE: Her own. Her own. ""Little House on the Prairie.""

GUTFELD: They didn't have posters of ""Little House on the Prairie."" Come on.

GUTFELD: Any of the Cassidys.

FRANCIS: OK, yes, any of the Cassidys.

GUTFELD: He still looks the same.

FRANCIS: I had all kinds of Billy Idol going on in my room. Every single poster. It was a little frightening for my parents. And these tiny little buttons that you put...

GUTFELD: Were you dancing with yourself?

FRANCIS: I'd put them on my teddy bear, which is, like, a kind of mixed up, scary thing.

BOLLING: ... which a lot of guys did. But my mom let me have it. But it had to be in the closet. It wasn't allowed to be on the walls. It was in the closet.

GUILFOYLE: And then you married Adrienne, much better looking.

BOLLING: Don't talk about coming in or out of the closet with that one. But I was a huge, huge Rolling Stones and Aerosmith fan. So anything Stones or Aerosmith went up on my walls.

BOLLING: Or The Who.

GUTFELD: What about you?

WILLIAMS: You know, I -- you know, my dad is involved with boxing. I love boxing, so it's odd characters like Alfredo Benitez, who was just a great boxer. But Ali. You know, I just like boxers.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, yes. One time I got this magazine. It was, like, ""Teen Beat"" or something.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, maybe that was it. And it had a free poster in there.

FRANCIS: Of course. And so I was like, OK. And I put it up. And then I put it up, and that was that. And it was nice. And then I eventually got to meet him. And then...

FRANCIS: Were you disappointed or happy?

GUILFOYLE: No, I was quite happy. And he sang to me. He has a beautiful voice.

GUTFELD: Wow. I used to have -- I used to have posters...

GUTFELD: ... of Lancelot Link, which was a money dressed as a detective. But I had posters underneath it. So that was the whole key. Is we always had posters that hid other posters so your parents never knew what you were really looking at.

GUILFOYLE: And what posters do you have, now?

FRANCIS: No, no. Don't ask that.

GUTFELD: I don't think you want to know.

All right. Start with you, Eric. From Cindy E., ""What did you want to be when you grew up?""

BOLLING: It's true. That's all I got for you.

GUTFELD: Quickly, Juan, what did you want to be when you grew up?

GUTFELD: A journalist? Wow, you were an exciting kid. Yes.

GUILFOYLE: Well, I wanted to be a prosecutor, and I did that. And then I decided, OK, I want to work in television. I did that. And now I decided I wanted do something else, and I'm going to do that.

FRANCIS: What was the other thing? Wait, can we come back to that?

GUTFELD: Well, we know. It's mayor of New York.

BOLLING: Is it? Or is it something else?

FRANCIS: What is it?

GUILFOYLE: Greg wants to write all of my mayoral speeches.

GUILFOYLE: No, but Bo Dietl's running for mayor.

GUTFELD: Oh, that -- is that -- really?

BOLLING: That's true. That is true.

GUTFELD: That's going to be -- that's going to be amazing.

WILLIAMS: And he told me he's running as a Democrat.

GUTFELD: That's the only thing you can do.

When you were a child, you already had a job.

FRANCIS: I was an actress, so I wanted to be everything. I was going to be a president and an actress and also a doctor. So I would, like, slip out to do an episode of ""Knots Landing"" and then, you know, go see some patients and then come back and protect the free world. I was going to just do it all at once.

GUTFELD: I would dress up as you often. You know, that still hasn't stopped.

FRANCIS: I do that now.

GUTFELD: One day I will be you. I will wear your skin, Kimberly. That's from ""Silence of the Lambs.""

BOLLING: You better be nice.

WILLIAMS: That's exactly what I thought.

GUILFOYLE: You're so Hannibal Lecter. You know that?

All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next.

BOLLING: All right. Time for ""One More Thing."" Juan is first -- Juan.

WILLIAMS: Today one of Hollywood's greats turned 100. The dimpled and macho, guess who? Kirk Douglas.

KIRK DOUGLAS, ACTOR: A free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life. A slave loses his pain. Death is the only freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it. That's why we all win.

WILLIAMS: People remember Douglas as the star of ""Spartacus."" But he was also in other classics, like ""Lust for Life"" and ""Paths for Glory.""

He's been with his wife, Anne, now for over 60 years. And he's still making appearances with his son and fellow actor, of course, Michael Douglas.

Happy birthday to you, sir. You are a joy.

WILLIAMS: Also, I want to send a quick shout-out to one of our fans here at ""The Five,"" Dr. Jerry Den Herder. Dr. Den Herder had a stroke this week, but he's such a big fan of ""The Five,"" check this out, Gregory. The first thing he did in the hospital, he demanded that the nurse switch the TV to FOX News so he could watch ""The Five,"" Eric. ""The Five."" Best wishes for a speedy recovery to Dr. Den Herder.

GUILFOYLE: I know. OK, so, time for...

GUILFOYLE: I love it. I love it. So -- Greg, please.

So Madame Tussauds in London has unveiled a special version of the royals wax figures this week, featuring each member in a Christmas sweater. Greg, look at how cute. Four real-life Corgis joined the photo shoot. The queen is a big fan and is wearing a little Corgi sweater. How adorable is that?

GUILFOYLE: This is not your turn, Greg. The royals actually granted permission for it as part of U.K. charity, Save the Children. Do you care now, Greg?

GUILFOYLE: Christmas Jumpers, a campaign. It starts on December 16 and encourages people to throw on their festive knits that day and donate to the cause. You can wear one of your unicorn sweaters.

GUTFELD: All right, then.

BOLLING: All righty. So tonight, make sure you tune in. Big ""O'Reilly Factor."" Donald Trump is going to go to Lansing, Michigan, and talk to them on the thank-you tour. You've got to stay tuned, because part of that will probably go into that hour.

But then Rudy Giuliani is going to join me to talk about exactly what we're talking about earlier. First time on camera, actually, talking about the secretary of state pick. And we'll figure out...

GUILFOYLE: And where he'll be this weekend at the -- right? -- Army-Navy game with the president-elect.

BOLLING: At the -- at the football game, Army-Navy football game.

GUTFELD: I said it. I've got Ambassador Bolton. We're going to hopefully talk to him about what's going on in that mustache of his. Erin McPike. We've got Kat Timpf. And Tyrus, a new employee of FOX News.

BOLLING: Oh, is he? Made a contributor?

GUILFOYLE: Yes, and by the way...

BOLLING: Do you think I could take him?

GUILFOYLE: Rudy Giuliani said that his pick would be John Bolton, by the way. So you can ask him Ambassador Bolton about that.

BOLLING: Let's get Melissa in here.

FRANCIS: All right. So since I'm in Dana's chair, I feel compelled to do something about a dog.

FRANCIS: And this is how they do Christmas in Clearwater, Florida. It is too warm for Santa and his reindeer. So that substitutes for a reindeer. That is Ollie, out in his red sleigh, delivering gifts.

Actually, so that's my mother-in-law's dog. I stole her son, so she got a giant dog.

This is -- he was out looking for Abby Huntsman here, ringing the bell at Salvation Army. She was down in a diner nearby, but he missed her, so he went home to watch a little football and get some weather. That is Ollie, a fantastic dog.

BOLLING: We've got to leave it right there. We've got eight seconds or so.

FRANCIS: They tell me that (ph).

BOLLING: Guess what's coming up right next?

3,538,"It was ten years ago today since the infamous Pizzagate incident marked the end of Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten run.

Cesc Fabregas allegedly threw a slice of pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson, landing on his face before sliding down his suit to the floor, in part of a full-time tunnel bust-up.

It all started when Ruud van Nistelrooy complained to Ferguson that Arsene Wenger had been giving him stick throughout the game - thus leading to a furious Fergie confronting the French boss.

But nobody could have predicted what happened next.

""All eyes turned and all mouths gawped to see this pizza slip off that famous puce face and roll down his nice black suit,"" is how Andy Cole described the debacle in his autobiography.

The ""Battle of the Buffet"" also reportedly had soup and sandwiches launched from team-to-team, as the Premier League's marquee fixture of the season descended into a school-like food fight.

But where are all the players from Pizzagate now? Here is where you can find them all...

The Northern Ireland stopper turned out 49 times for Manchester United in the Premier League, before departing Old Trafford in 2005 to become a textbook football journeyman, having spent time at - deep breath - West Ham, Rangers, Derby, Odense BK, OFI Crete and Olympiacos. He can currently be found between the sticks at Notts County.

G-Nev hung up his boots in 2011 having racked up 602 appearances for United and now whiles away his days either arguing with Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports or putting the cones out for Roy Hodgson.

The ex-England defender called time on his trophy-laden Old Trafford career this summer, with a number of offers apparently sent his way. After much deliberation, he joined Harry Redknapp at QPR but has struggled for form since arriving at Loftus Road.

After departing United in 2008, the Frenchman joined rivals Arsenal on a free transfer. A couple of years at the Emirates followed before spells in Germany and the MLS. Silvestre has recently agreed a deal with Chennaiyin FC in the new Indian Super League.

The defender left Manchester for Madrid in 2007 before joining Marseille and then Roma. Heinze's career ended where it began, in his native Argentina with Newell's Old Boys, when he hung up his boots this summer.

Last spotted terrorising Liverpool at Anfield. The Portuguese has taken his game to another level since leaving Old Trafford. At Real Madrid, Ronaldo has smashed almost every goal record in sight alongside his impressive trophy haul. His sumptuous goal against Liverpool took him within one of Raul's Champions League tally.

United's go-to guy on the big occasions swapped United for Everton in 2005, where he captained the Toffees before retiring in 2013. That summer he followed boss David Moyes to Old Trafford as the Scot's first-team coach but departed after the ill-fated reign. Neville is now regularly found challenging his brother's punditry skills on Match of the Day.

The Red Devils' most successful player ever remains a firm part of the club's furniture. Following Moyes' reign, Giggs took temporary charge for the remainder of the season. Louis van Gaal's arrival saw the Welshman appointed assistant boss and marked the end of his illustrious career. Just the 963 appearances.

Rooney celebrated his 19th birthday in style 10 years ago by scoring the second goal. Plenty more have followed, along with controversies, with the England man taking the United armband this summer. He needs 30 goals to become the club's all-time top goalscorer.

The other scorer on that wet Old Trafford afternoon, Van Nistelrooy hung up his boots in 2012. After leaving the club, the Dutchman enjoyed spells at Real Madrid, Hamburg and Malaga and is now the assistant boss to Gus Hiddink with the Holland national team.

After never really making the grade at United, Howard moved to Everton on loan in 2006. That deal was made permanent the following summer and the American has remained on Merseyside ever since. Still one of the top goalkeepers in the Premier League.

After over 200 apperances, Brown bid farewell to his boyhood club in 2011 to join Sunderland. His tenure at the Stadium of Light has been ruined by injuries but he played a key role in the club's survival push last season.

United were so desperate to land Miller, they sealed a pre-contract agreement in January 2004 before taking him to Old Trafford that summer. Just nine league appearances followed before spells at Sunderland, QPR and Hibs. The Irishman can now be found at Brisbane Roar in the Australian A-league.

The Frenchman never lived up to the £12.4million United coughed up for him in 2004 as injuries hindered his progress. It was a similar story at Everton for Saha, although he did break the record for the earliest goal in an FA Cup final. Short-term deals at Spurs and Lazio followed before retirement in 2013.

Like Saha, Smith's time with the Red Devils was also dogged by injury woes. The ex-England man never really recovered from a leg break in the FA Cup at Liverpool and joined Newcastle in 2007. Smith managed just over 80 appearances in five years in the north east before moving to MK Dons. He is now plying his trade with Notts County in League One.

Now 44, the former German international stayed with the Gunners until 2008, making 199 appearances during that time. The mad-cap keeper moved on to VFB Stuttgart until 2010, when he returned to the Emirates Stadium, coming out of retirement to help the club amid a goalkeeper's injury crisis. Now often seen on Sky Germany's Bundesliga and Champions League coverage.

Rated by Arsene Wenger as one of his best ever signings, the Cameroonian left Arsenal in 2006 to join Portsmouth in their boom-to-bust years. However, he spent much of his time at Fratton Park as second-choice and eventually left in 2009. His final playing days came in Spain at Cordoba in 2010, after which he retired.

The 73-cap England defender left the Gunners after the 2006 Champions League Final - in which he scored - before spending time with Portsmouth, Notts County, Arsenal again and Newcastle. Released by the club in May 2011, he announced his retirement a year later.

The Ivorian defender remained in north London until a £16million move to Manchester City in 2009, having made 326 appearances for the Gunners. 103 appearances for City followed - as well as a Premier League winners' medal - before he joined Liverpool on a free transfer in 2013. Aged 33, he's still at Anfield.

After almost swerving off the road after only being offered £55,000-a-week, Cole left Arsenal to join Chelsea in 2006. In eight years he won a third Premier League, a seventh FA Cup (a record) and got his hands on both the Champions League and Europa League before leaving on a free transfer in 2014 to join AS Roma in Italy.

Now 37, Ljungberg has taken his footballing talents on something of a global tour since leaving Arsenal in 2007. West Ham, Seattle Sounders, Chicago Fire, Celtic, Shimizu S-Pulse and now Mumbai City - who he joined in 2014, two years after retirement - have all been called home by the Swede.

The Invincibles' captain, Vieira left Arsenal for Juventus in 2005 and took in Inter Milan and Manchester City before retirement in 2011. Now 38, the Frenchman still works for City, working as the reserve-team manager, having previously been the club's Football Development Executive.

The languid midfielder had a wonderful left-foot and was a key member of the Gunners squad during their best years - although not always necessarily as a starter. Left Arsenal in 2005 to join Valencia, before returning to his homeland in 2009 with Corinthians, where he is now director of football.

Signed for £17million from Sevilla in January 2003, the Spanish international showed glimpses of his talent at Arsenal, but never produced his best often enough. Joined Real Madrid on loan in 2006, where he won the Spanish title, before joining Atletico permanently the following year. Now back with Sevilla, with whom he won the Europa League (for the third time in his career) last season.

After 423 games and 120 goals for the Gunners, the Dutchman retired in 2006. Gone but never forgotten, a statue of the iconic No.10 was unveiled outside the Emirates in 2014. Bergkamp is currently back at first love Ajax, working as assistant manager to Frank de Boer.

Arsenal's greatest-ever goalscorer, in two spells with the club Henry struck 228 goals in 376 matches, while he also became France's record-scorer with 51 in 123 games for Les Bleus. Joined Barcelona in 2007 and conquered Europe, he has spent the last four years in MLS with New York Red Bulls. Expected to retire in November.

After making 18 appearances for the Gunners, his career never really kicked on after that. He has only made 62 appearances since his career began in 1997 - and that spans across 11 clubs. After spending three years at Manchester City from 2009 to 2012 without taking to the pitch once, he is now at Leeds United... and has again not made an apperance.

He was a mainstay in the Arsenal Invincible line-up but was soon moved on from the club once the unbeaten run came to an end. After featuring for a short period for Villarreal, the Frenchman signed for newly-promoted Italian second division side Cartagena before calling it a day. Now 40, he has no involvement in the game.

Arguably one of Arsenal's best players during the Invincibles period, Pires scored of average one in every three games from the centre of midfield. He is currently playing the Indian Super League for FC Goa, where he was recently reportedly punched in the face by an opposing coach. It is his first club in three years, after departing Aston Villa in 2011.

Well, this career got off to a dramatic start, didn't it. Reportedly the one to throw the pizza at Ferguson, Fabregas enjoyed his name in more glittering lights later in his career. Transferred to Barcelona in 2011, he has recently returned to England for city rivals Chelsea, where he has notched up an incredible nine assists already this season.

The Dutchman made the controversial switch from Arsenal to Manchester United in 2012 and continued his fine goalscoring form. He now has 40 goals in 65 appearances for the Red Devils. Now at 31-years-old, he has been entrusted with leading the line for United and Louis van Gaal's new-look front-line.",mainstream,M1a13a,pizzagate
4,192,"The son of Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has lost his job in the president-elect’s transition team after he spread a false conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton that led to shots being fired in pizza restaurant.

While working for his father, Michael Flynn Jr tweeted an erroneous theory that Clinton’s allies had been running a paedophile ring in the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlour in Washington.

Even after a man on Sunday fired a rifle in the restaurant, in an incident apparently sparked by the conspiracy theory, Flynn said on Twitter that the fake news would “remain a story” until proven false.

The incident has heightened concerns about the incoming administration’s fondness for fake news and raised further questions about the suitability of Flynn Sr, who has also shared bogus stories on social media.

Mike Pence, the vice-president-elect, initially denied that Flynn’s son was working for the troubled Trump transition team. But on Tuesday he admitted on CNN that Flynn Jr had been helping his father, but that was “no longer the case”.

The New York Times reported that Flynn Jr had planned to work for his father as part of the national security council team, and started the process of getting national security clearance.

Since the election the Twitter postings of Flynn Sr have been uncontroversial. But days before the vote he tweeted a “must read” link to a story falsely claiming that Clinton’s emails contained proof of money-laundering and child abuse.

Flynn also promoted conspiracy theorists throughout the campaign. He encouraged his followers to read a book by Mike Cernovich, whose website has suggested Clinton’s campaign chairman was part of a “sex cult with connections to human trafficking”. Flynn also tagged white nationalist Jared Wyand on social media.

Speaking to the the New York Times, Michael Hayden, the former CIA and National Security Agency director, said: “The national security adviser should have a moderating effect on the instincts of the president, and it remains to be seen if Mike can do that.”

Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to the vice-president, Joe Biden, said she was deeply troubled by Flynn’s tendency to promote fake news. She told the Associated Press his job would be to “ensure that the White House is focused at all times on all of the threats that the United States faces abroad”.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Flynn’s willingness to promote fake news “raises profound questions about his suitability for this important position”.

Tom Nichols, a professor at the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, where Flynn obtained a master’s degree in national security and strategic studies in 2001, said: “If the national security adviser is going to be the direct conduit between the president and the national security world, of course it’s a concern that that adviser is being taken in by conspiracy theories and fake news.”",mainstream,M16b69,pizzagate

Bullshit, James Ball tells me, can get you into the Oval Office.

The former Guardian journalist and now special correspondent at BuzzFeed is well versed in separating fact from fiction.As a young reporter fresh out of university he started as an intern at WikiLeaks, working on the verification and publication of confidential US documents in 2010, and then on the Snowden leaks in 2013 during his time at The Guardian.

That’s all to say he’s developed a sixth sense for what is, and isn’t, bullshit.

With this in mind, today Ball is publishing his debut book as a solo author on the fake news phenomenon which has engulfed the world of politics over the last year.

We sat down with Ball to find out how half-truths, untruths and outright fakery took over:

Fake news, post-truths and bullshit, is this a new phenomenon?

This definitely isn't new: newspapers have run questionable stories for as long as they've existed, and fake news has circulated the web for just as long.

But things have changed a bit – fake news got political last year, because that was the way to get huge audiences.

So it's some old trends that have suddenly really come to the fore.



So who's to blame for fake news?

Russia! More seriously – all of us.

Fake news is just the most visible bit of what is a whole ecosystem of half-truths, untruths and outright fakery, or in other words, of bullshit.

When we share a story without thinking about it or checking, we're part of that system. When a hyper-partisan news site (think Breitbart or The Canary) over-hypes and spins a kernel of truth into something much bigger, that's part of it.

When mainstream outlets run too-good-to-check stories, they're part of it. And when Facebook and others profit off this whole system, they're part of it too.

Are there examples of fake news causing real harm?

The Pizzagate conspiracy – an alt-right theory that pizza parlours were harbouring secret child abuse sites used by leading democrats – led to an armed man storming a DC pizza parlour.

So the consequences of this stuff can be very real.

Polling shows Republicans believe Obama wiretapped Trump (there's no evidence he did), while many Democrats believe US election machines themselves were hacked (there's no evidence of this either).

When we all believe different facts, we can't have a public conversation – we can only have a shouting match.

So what's the solution? Will we ever be free of fake news?

The upside of all of us being part of the problem is that we can all be part of the solution.

We need to find ways to make corrections reach as many people as the initial bad reports and hoaxes do. We've got to find new ways to cover politicians and campaigns which deploy bullshit to win. There's no one big fix, but there's lots of little things all of us can do.

The fightback can start whenever we like.

6,427,"I am republishing this post from July 27, 2010 in view of Pizzagate, which gives this post a new significance.

 When you read this post, just remember that a pedophile is defined as an adult with “sexual fondness for and activity” with children, i.e., minors below the age of consent. In other words, the definition doesn’t require that there be sexual abuse of a child; sexual attraction to children is definitive. That in turn means that the Pentagon employees busted for child porn are pedophiles.

 

 Remember the news back in April 2010 that, while the economy crashed, senior staffers at the federal government’s Securities and Exchange Commission were spending hours surfing pornographic websites on government-issued computers while they were being paid to police the financial system?

 Now comes news that employees and contractors of the Pentagon are buying and watching child porn on the taxpayers’ dime. Not only is porn-watching on government computers illegal, it is against the law for all Americans to purchase and view child pornography. Worse still, some of the Pentagon child porn creeps have high-level security clearances, which makes them national security hazards because their sexual perversion makes them vulnerable to blackmail.

 On July 23, 2010, Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post reports that “Federal investigators have identified about 20 Pentagon employees and contractors accused of buying and downloading online child pornography and in some cases used their government-issued computers to view the illegal material.”

 According to a 94-page report released by the Defense Department’s inspector general’s office, some of those involved possessed top-secret security clearances and worked for such divisions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Reconnaissance Office. Those agencies deal with some of the government’s most sensitive intelligence and defense work.

 The number of Pentagon employees investigated was not disclosed in the report, but a Pentagon spokeswoman said the probe involved about 20 people who had an “affiliation with the Defense Department” as full-time employees, former military members or contractors. Some of those people have been prosecuted, and some of their cases were dropped for lack of evidence. Other cases remain open.

 The cases are part of a wider probe, Operation Flicker, which was started by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement four years ago and which has identified more than 5,000 people who subscribed to online child pornography websites.

 The cases detailed in the new report include one involving an employee of Oracle Corp. who had a top-secret clearance and worked on a contract for the National Security Agency. The man subscribed to various child pornography websites and made 21 purchases. After authorities started investigating him, the report said, he attempted to tamper with computers at his office. He was put on administrative leave with pay. He later fled to Libya but was arrested and extradited to the United States.

 Another case involved a government employee at the National Defense University in Norfolk who made two purchases from a child pornography website. He pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and was sentenced to five years in prison.

 It is illegal to access pornography with a government computer.

Five years later, the Boston Globe discovered the Pentagon still had not investigated as many as 1,700 of the cases involving employees suspected of child-porn.

7,591,"Picture adult engagement with information as a continuum. On one side sits intentional (or actively sought) information, and on the other lives seemingly incidental (or passively received) information (see Figure 1). In this section, we address the two ends of this continuum and then discuss the space in between.

Our continuum is based entirely on work in schools and with teachers; however, a reviewer of earlier drafts of this article pointed us to Ross's (1999) concept of finding without seeking, which led us to Williamson's (1998) article, which distinguished incidental information acquisition from purposeful information seeking. These older studies serve to remind us that the concepts employed here are not new, although the ubiquity, speed, and scale of information encountered in the age of the internet is.

Educators need to address these challenges, but where are they to begin? As part of the SHEG ( 2016 ) study, the researchers compared the way students approached judging credibility with the way professional fact‐checkers approached the same tasks (Wineburg & McGrew, 2016 ). This is an interesting and important line of research, partly because it compares various kinds of readers and reading purposes and partly because it grows from an authentic example of adult interaction with text. We also see value in exploring the relation between identity and information seeking (Kohnen, in press ) and wonder how schools might design learning environments where students not only learn fact‐checking skills but also learn to value facts.

The utility of the rules for internet searching that are currently and commonly taught is suspect given the range of topics likely addressed in the upper left quadrant of Figure 2 . When querying settled issues that are uncontroversial, the rules may make some sense. However, the issues that fall into the upper left quadrant are often those that are most controversial or otherwise unsettled. The more current the question is, the less likely one is to find peer‐reviewed research on it; library scientists have described this as the information cycle. Navigating the digital floodwaters is perhaps most treacherous when users are in unsettled territory, but if educators are to prepare students for authentic, intentional searching, isn't it their responsibility to help students gather information about unsettled topics?

The high‐stakes searches should be a high priority for schools, but the small amount of information‐seeking instruction currently occurring appears to be almost exclusively focused on preparing students for searches that fall into the upper right quadrant of Figure 2 . Clearly, students should be exposed to what it means to search like an expert and should learn to use specific websites that historians, scientists, literary critics, or mathematicians find highly credible. Yet, should this be the only kind of information‐seeking instruction that students receive? After all, the upper left quadrant of Figure 2 (“highly important/low preparation”) is a place where we will all find ourselves at one point or another in our lives. Questions related to citizenship, personal finance, health, and consumer decisions may all fall into this quadrant.

Again, based on surveys and conversations with adults of all ages, we conclude that most people engage in intentional information seeking of all kinds at one point or another. Examples from Angela's perspective are included in Figure 2 for illustrative purposes, and we have invited dozens of adults to think about their recent information‐seeking endeavors in these terms. We hope that this graphic will help start a conversation about what it means to prepare students to be successful in different kinds of searches. In all likelihood, educators will see the low‐stakes searches as a low priority for schools; perhaps teachers might model via a search‐aloud (Saul, Kohnen, Newman, & Pearce, 2012 ) how they engage in low‐stakes searches of different kinds, but otherwise these kinds of searches probably demand little curricular space.

However, the internet‐searching rules imposed by many teachers do little to prepare students for the daily information needs of adults, needs that are not primarily academic or even career in nature. In fact, the banned resources are the bedrock of many of the searches that adults engage in as parents, moviegoers, hobbyists, and so forth (for more on Wikipedia, see Alvermann, 2017 ). We propose thinking about these needs in terms of two variables: importance (Is the information need high or low stakes?) and preparation (How well has your education and/or experience prepared you to deal with the information you find?; see Figure 2 ).

Searches undertaken in schools appear to be designed to help students succeed in formal academic environments. If the goal of schools is to prepare students to succeed as academics in training, it might make sense to ban Wikipedia; after all, academics do not usually cite tertiary sources such as Wikipedia in their formal writing. Likewise, perhaps teachers privilege .gov and .edu domain names because they associate these domains with an editorial process, and some teachers may encourage students to go to the databases in an attempt to steer them toward peer‐reviewed resources.

It appears that most teachers recognize how difficult navigating the digital floodwaters is for students and believe that rules are needed as basic signposts or clues. Yet, these rules do not teach students to assess the credibility of online information as a nuanced or critical thinking activity. Instead, these inflexible rules mask differences between websites that may have a similar domain name or the same suffix; do not account for the various kinds of information that exist online (e.g., blogs, newspapers, magazines, commercial product sites, professional and amateur videos); and privilege academic searches over other kinds of information seeking, as we discuss next.

Since 2009, we have been collecting survey, focus group, and interview data on the ways that students are being taught to access information online. We have also talked informally with teachers as part of other projects that take us into schools. Our respondents came from urban, suburban, and rural upper elementary, middle, and high school classrooms (grades 4–12) in schools in the U.S. Midwest and Southeast. We also discussed internet searching with a group of college students at a highly selective university (see Kohnen & Saul, 2017 ). Based on several hundred responses, the following trends became apparent:

Compounding the problem, high‐stakes tests, including state tests such as those developed by Smarter Balanced and the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, as well as college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT, do not currently demand that students find their own information. Rather, tests are scored on students' ability to read provided texts and cite relevant details from those texts in a coherent essay that answers someone else's question. In this environment, we have even heard principals characterize student curiosity as a potential distraction that must be managed. In sum, the answer to the question about whether the curriculum allots space and time for students' own queries and curiosities is often no or at least not enough.

Since the Common Core State Standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010 ) were unveiled, schools across the United States have devoted more time to informational and other kinds of nonfiction texts (see also the National Assessment of Educational Progress frameworks, on which the Common Core's reading and writing distributions were based). However, as noted earlier, these texts are typically teacher selected or curriculum dictated, with little input or effort on the part of students. Surely, teaching students to read and engage with complex nonfiction is a challenging task, and working with class texts may be a necessary or effective way to introduce certain skills or engage in whole‐group discussions. Yet, without time and space to explore their own questions and curiosities, students have little chance to practice their intentional information‐seeking skills in personal and motivating contexts. Understandably, teachers express worry that the curriculum is already too crowded; the unpredictability of student‐driven information seeking may feel, in one teacher's words, “just too hard.”

As this list makes clear, the information sought may be serious or trivial, uncontested or complex. Because intentional information acquisition implies action (from finding directions to choosing a diet plan to deciding how to vote), it also involves skills: the skills to seek, find, assess, and comprehend a wide variety of texts (often in a variety of modalities). Curriculum developers have deemed some information important and purposefully ignored other informational needs. For instance, few teachers teach or grade a young person's ability to follow a baseball team's efforts, even though they may recognize this effort as useful, engaging, and perhaps even wholesome.

At the other end of the information–acquisition continuum sits incidental information, the information that we are all exposed to on a near‐constant basis. The term incidental seems to imply that information is simply sprayed about and hits some of us. This is, to a limited extent, the case: An airport blasts us with television news, and a YouTube video is available only if one first watches an advertisement. Other forms of incidental information are targeted based on who one is (e.g., the targeted ads and articles that pop up on our computer screens), where one lives, or what one does. Regardless of why this non‐sought‐out information comes to us, the amount of incidental information that we encounter is astounding, as recent studies have estimated (see Bohn & Short, 2012; Short, 2013).

Schools have historically sought to ignore incidental information, despite the fact that it composes a huge proportion of the information diet. Yet, to bring incidental information and ideas thoughtfully into the curriculum, educators need to recognize first that incidental information is, in fact, a fund of knowledge. Until incidental information is recognized as such, educators will not be able to analyze its sources, its effects, or its role in students' lives.

Many scholars have discussed the disconnect between home and school literacies, particularly for students whose home cultures do not align with the culture represented by their school (e.g., Heath, 1983; Moje, Ciechanowski, & Kramer, 2004). In this same sense, it is important to note that incidental information should be considered a literacy that may or may not align with school discourse. Imagine the information that students are exposed to as part of their everyday, out‐of‐school lives through no seemingly active effort on their part: television and radio programs; websites that happen to be up on a computer or tablet when a student sits down to play or work with it; physical copies of magazines, newspapers, and books in the home; and automatic texts or RSS feeds that appear on a phone or in an e‐mail inbox. These sources often also inspire adult conversations that students may join or simply overhear. More important perhaps is the information picked up in dinnertime conversations or on outings with family members or friends.

The sheer amount of incidental information that students are exposed to outside of school may be a critical component of school success. In studies that focused on physical resources, Neuman and Celano (2001) and Neuman and Moland (2016) found socioeconomic differences in access to print for very young children, with children in low‐income neighborhoods having fewer print resources available. Neuman and Moland coined the term book deserts to describe the lack of physical books in areas of concentrated poverty. We suspect that there may be similar differences in the amount of incidental information that students are exposed to outside of schools and, surely, differences in the types and sources of such information, such as the kinds of books, magazines, and newspapers in the home; access to high‐speed internet and the technologies to take advantage of it; and adult conversations around incidental information. In other words, experiences with incidental information often help students do better (or worse) in schools.

The issue here is one of alignment. Although the amount and content of incidental information that young people are exposed to may differ across socioeconomic classes, a proposition that we have not investigated, all residents living in the United States in the 21st century are exposed to a great deal of incidental information. Yet, when incidental information aligns nicely with the discourses of school, the bar for learning new information in school is relatively low. However, when the incidental information to which students are exposed (perhaps because of class, culture, neighborhood, or other reasons) is quite different from or at odds with school discourses, the bar for school success is much higher. Said differently, experiences with incidental information likely make school harder or easier for students.

In contrast to a deficit model of thinking, Moll and colleagues (e.g., Moll, 2015; Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez, 1992) focused on resource‐based pedagogy, a way of teaching that builds on what students, families, and communities know (i.e., their funds of knowledge). Inspired by Moll, we ask, How might incidental information be considered a fund of knowledge? How might teachers learn what incidental information makes up the backdrop of their students' lives and use this information as a resource for teaching?

From a student perspective and by our own definition of non‐sought‐out knowledge, the school curriculum often, if not always, focuses on incidental information. The curriculum is typically determined by someone else and is presented to students with very little, if any, input on their part. Even when students are in classrooms that promote active learning, the activity is almost always focused on learning predetermined concepts about predetermined topics; as noted earlier, in many schools, very little time is dedicated to students' own curiosities and queries. However, one of the gifts of an exceptional teacher is the ability to inspire students to move from passive information acquisition to active, intentional information seeking, often about topics that the students never considered before. Curricular units almost always start with students in a passive role in terms of topic, concept, or information to be learned; that is, although they may be engaged in active learning, they usually have not selected the curriculum itself. Yet, through the guidance of a teacher, students can take an active interest in finding out more. For example, Wendy (second author) recently witnessed an upper elementary science teacher teaching a unit on animals native to the state. Inspired by their teacher's enthusiasm, students eagerly researched a bird and wrote individual entries for a class book on “what makes native birds cool.” We doubt that many of the students in this class would have chosen to seek out bird information on their own prior to their teacher's invitation, but they found her enthusiasm and deep interest in their research irresistible. We suggest that our continuum of information acquisition may be useful for teachers as they think about the curriculum from the perspective of their students. Engaging students in active learning is not a new concept, of course, but the intentional end of the continuum is specifically about active seeking, not just activity in terms of classroom talk or movement. Our respect and even love for education was built on the efforts of influential teachers who inspired us to want to know more about a topic previously viewed as foreign and perhaps even boring. Although such engagement likely cannot happen for every student during every unit, including more opportunities for active, intentional information seeking on curricular topics is a reasonable goal.

Finally, we wonder how schools can equip students to recognize and respond appropriately when incidental information is a distraction. Today, adults and children alike struggle to manage the onslaught of incidental information. Incidental information, in the form of background radio or television programs or the constant influx of e‐mail and text messages, is ubiquitous. Images of couples staring at screens rather than making conversation and parents pushing children on swings while checking their phones have become cliché, but they also represent a frightening reality. Our students today live with a 24‐hour news cycle that must manufacture news to fill airtime; many also believe in the myth of multitasking and attempt to do homework while clicking back and forth among multiple information feeds. Learning to shut down or limit the flow of incidental information, or at least judge when it is worthy of attention, may be an overlooked 21st‐century literacy skill.",mainstream,M0abbd,pizzagate
8,948,"Move over, pizza rat. The internet has a new hero, and it's a pizza-eating man who hilariously photobombed a reporter on air. A video going viral with over a million views on Twitter shows a congressional staffer in the US unintentionally photobombing a CBSN reporter while eating pizza - and the Internet is loving it.

According to Mediaite, the video was shot while the reporter was covering former Donald Trump attorney Michael Cohen's testimony on Wednesday afternoon. In the video, as he speaks on camera, a congressional staffer behind him in the hallway proceeds to take a big bite out of his pizza. The short clip captures the moment 'Hallway pizza guy' realises he's in the shot - and it will make you laugh out loud.

Netizens haven't stopped laughing at the hilarious photobomb since it was shared online. See some of the best reactions below:

The video even earned the photobomber a loving nickname: Hallway pizza guy

This isn't the first time an unsuspecting news anchor has been photobombed on air. Last year, a scarlet bird landed on a reporter's head during a live broadcast, and the hilarious footage went viral.",mainstream,M0799b,pizzagate
9,941,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returned Tuesday to his vision of a non-interventionist foreign policy for the United States, saying, as he did during his campaign, that he does not want American forces fighting ""in areas that we shouldn't be fighting in.""

At a ""thank you"" rally for his supporters in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Trump said his focus instead will be on defeating terrorists, including the Islamic State group.

""We will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn't be involved with,"" Trump said, insisting the United States must end a ""destructive cycle of intervention and chaos.""

Fayetteville neighbors the U.S. Army's Fort Bragg, the world's largest military base, as well as the U.S. Air Force's Pope Field. Eight military installations dot the state.

Trump pledged to build up the military with the purpose of projecting strength, not aggression.

As a candidate, Trump frequently questioned whether NATO and other allies were pulling their weight. On Tuesday, he said he wanted to strengthen ""old friendships"" and seek new ones.

At the same rally, Trump formally announced his choice of retired Marine General James Mattis as his nominee for secretary of defense.

""Under his leadership, such an important position, we will rebuild our military and alliances, destroy terrorists, face our enemies head on and make America safe again,"" Trump said.

Michael O'Hanlon, a senior defense expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, called Mattis ""one of the best read, best informed and most experienced generals of his generation.""

Mattis has served as the head of U.S. Central Command, which carries out U.S. operations in the Middle East, and the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces.

The retired general will need a congressional waiver in order to be confirmed as secretary of defense. Mattis otherwise would be ineligible to serve because of a law that requires a seven-year wait for former members of the military to serve in the post. He has been retired for less than four years.

Pizzagate



 Trump's transition team also cut ties Tuesday with Michael G. Flynn, the son of the president-elect's choice to be national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.

The younger Flynn had an advisory role with his father and an official transition team email address, though the exact extent of his involvement with the incoming administration is unclear.

He came under intense criticism for sharing fake news stories, including spreading the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy that alleges a pizza place in Washington, D.C., is involved in a pedophilia ring with ties to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

A gunman was arrested Sunday after firing a shot inside the restaurant. He'd told police he'd traveled from his home in North Carolina to ""self-investigate"" the conspiracy.

After the arrest, Flynn again tweeted about Pizzagate.

""Until #Pizzagate is proven to be false, it'll remain a story,"" he wrote.

The elder Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, has his own history of promoting false claims, including some involving Clinton.

Earlier Tuesday, Trump appeared in the lobby of his New York office building with Masayoshi Son, the head of Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank, who announced plans to invest $50 billion in the United States with a goal of creating 50,000 jobs.

SoftBank had established a fund in October, along with Saudi Arabia and others, to invest up to $100 billion in technology companies. The $50 billion initiative announced Monday would come from that money. No timetable was given for the investments focused on startup companies.

Trump claimed credit for Son's commitment, saying on Twitter it would not have happened had he not won last month's election.

SoftBank owns U.S. mobile carrier Sprint, which two years ago had a proposed merger with T-Mobile rejected by regulators on anti-trust grounds. Analysts believe such a merger would be easier under Trump, who is a proponent of removing regulations he says are killing businesses.

Campaigned on jobs



 Trump, in his unlikely march to the White House, had campaigned on bringing more jobs to America, particularly in manufacturing regions hit hard by the recession and globalization.

The SoftBank deal is the second that Trump has used to boast about keeping his promises to voters. Last week, he announced that the Carrier Manufacturing Corp. would keep 800 jobs in Indiana instead of outsourcing them to Mexico. Carrier still plans to outsource hundreds of jobs from another Indiana plant.

Trump also wrote on Twitter that he wants to terminate an order for a new Air Force One, the plane that flies U.S. presidents around the world. The government has contracted Boeing to construct at least two new planes, which would go into service in 2024. The total cost was initially expected to be about $3 billion.

Trump wrote that ""the costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.""

Boeing responded to Trump's criticism with a statement saying at this point in the process only a much smaller amount of money has been committed.

""We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States,"" the aerospace giant's statement said.

""We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.""",mainstream,M12936,pizzagate

Shocking and compelling visual images are the most effective approach. The one minute video below contains extremely eye opening time-lapse film footage of a massive atmospheric aerosol spraying assault. Up close footage of a jet aircraft spray dispersion is also captured. Visual proof is the most powerful key to raising awareness.

Waking someone up to something they don't want to hear and don't want to know is an extremely difficult task, programmed denial is epidemic in our society. Simple straightforward visual tools are (in most cases) the best introduction method. In addition to the many compelling jet spraying videos that can be shared online, an effective informational flyer is almost always far more effective than a verbal dissertation for face to face introductions to the climate engineering/weather warfare issue.

11,885,"Use of color-coded bandannas in the gay and BDSM communities

The handkerchief code (also known as the hanky code, the bandana code, and flagging[1]) is a color-coded system, employed usually among the gay male casual-sex seekers or BDSM practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, to indicate preferred sexual fetishes, what kind of sex they are seeking, and whether they are a top/dominant or bottom/submissive.

Wearing a handkerchief on the left side of the body typically indicates one is a ""top"" (one considered active in the practice of the act/fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief), while wearing it on the right side of the body would indicate one is a ""bottom"" (one considered passive in the practice of the act/fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief). The hanky code was widely used in the 1970s by gay and bisexual men.

The wearing of various colored bandanas around the neck was common in the mid- and late-nineteenth century among cowboys, steam railroad engineers, and miners in the Western United States. It is thought that the wearing of bandanas by gay men originated in San Francisco after the Gold Rush, when, because of a shortage of women, men dancing with each other in square dances developed a code wherein the man wearing the blue bandana took the male part in the square dance, and the man wearing the red bandana took the female part (these bandanas were usually worn around the arm or hanging from the belt or in the back pocket of one's jeans).[2]

It is thought that the modern hanky code started in New York City in late 1970 or early 1971 when a journalist for the Village Voice joked that instead of simply wearing keys to indicate whether someone was a ""top"" or a ""bottom"", it would be more efficient to subtly announce their particular sexual focus by wearing different colored hankies.[3] Other sources attribute the expansion of the original red–blue system into today's code to marketing efforts around 1971 by the San Francisco department store for erotic merchandise, The Trading Post, promoting handkerchiefs by printing cards listing the meanings of various colors.[4]

Alan Selby, founder of Mr. S Leather in San Francisco, claimed that he created the first hanky code with his business partners at Leather 'n' Things in 1972, when their bandana supplier inadvertently doubled their order and the expanded code would help them sell the extra colors they had received.[5]

Bob Damron's Address Book is also notable when referencing the Handkerchief Code. Starting in 1964, a businessman by the name of Bob Damron published a book of all the gay bars he knew from his constant travels across the United States. “This book fit comfortably in the palm of your hand,” a description reads. “Despite its petite size, this book was an impressive accomplishment. Each one of the listings he had visited himself. Every last copy of the book he sold himself.”[2] Bob Damron's Address Book also published a yearly chart for the meaning of each colored hanky under the title ""COLOR CODES"".[2]

This table is drawn from Larry Townsend's The Leatherman's Handbook II (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) and is generally considered authoritative. Implicit in this list is the concept of left/right polarity, left as usual indicating the top, dominant, or active partner; right the bottom, submissive, or passive partner. Negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because, as Townsend noted, people may wear hankies of any color ""only because the idea of the hankie turns them on"" or ""may not even know what it means"".[6]

The longer lists found on the web are more elaborate and the many color codes in them are less often used in practice, although some of these colors are offered for sale at LGBT stores along with free cards listing their meanings.

While the hankie code was a semiotic system of sexual advertising popular among the gay leather community of the United States[7], it is no longer as popular in the modern day era. It may be seen as something kinkier to use in gay pornography, or at sex and fetish events like the Folsom Street Fair. Social networks may have replaced the use of hankies in cruising areas by digitizing the process. By using online platforms, men who have sex with men (MSM) can eliminate harassment and violence that they may face in public.[8] Social networks for MSM also allow for sub-groups, and for people to list fetishes, and what they are looking for, which is where the replacement of the need for hankies may have come from.[8] Grindr is the most popular app for MSM who use social networks for cruising, with an average of 1.3 hours per day spent on the app per user.[9]

12,1248,"SO WHAT’D YOU THINK OF MEGYN KELLY’S ALEX JONES FEATURE LAST NIGHT? Putting aside the fiery debate about whether Kelly and NBC News were right to give such primo airtime to a man who has spread dangerous conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and the Sandy Hook hoax nonsense, the question for many journalists ahead of last night’s highly-anticipated “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly” segment was all about how tough Kelly would prove to be in grilling her controversial subject -- just three weeks into her new program, at that. Given how high the stakes were as a result of last week’s public outcry, one assumes the editors at NBC News were working overtime to make sure the piece was as tough as possible. And given the favorable reviews, one assumes the network is happy with the .

-- The Infowars boss downplayed his relationship with President Trump: “I think my influence on Trump is way way lower than what MSM has said.” Kelly: “Well what kind of access do you have?” Jones: “He's just called sometimes and, you know, talked about politics or thanked me, stuff like that. That's it.”

-- Ridiculous statement: “The media never covers all the evil wars it’s promoted.” Kelly responded, “That doesn’t excuse what you said about Newtown, and you know it.” But really, she coulda/shoulda nailed him on the “media doesn’t cover wars” part.

-- This is more like it: “You misstated facts about Chobani and its owner which, you could’ve found out if you just had a reporter do a little shoe-leather reporting -- pick up the phone, check out the facts. You never would have had to retract that or apologize.”

-- “Do you think of yourself as a journalist?” Jones: “I have some journalists that work for me and I do journalistic work and I’ve broken a lot of big stories and I understand the basics of it.”

If you missed it last night, you can watch the full clip .

Veteran CNN TV critic Brian Lowry: “[T]he piece that aired Sunday credibly justified covering the Infowars phenomenon, which was the bar that ""Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly"" ultimately had to clear. … Moving into a prosecutorial mode that was frequently her strength on Fox, Kelly did press him, enlisting a Newtown parent and MSNBC contributor Charlie Sykes to help contextualize the ‘toxic paranoia’ that he spreads among his listeners. … Kelly's handling of the interview should calm some nerves [at NBC News], even if it won't quiet all the dissenting voices.”

Our own Jack Shafer: “[S]he took the mendacious Jones apart in such a textbook manner you had to wonder what all the shouting had been about. … Short of waterboarding him, I don’t know what more Kelly could have done to expose Jones’ dark methods.”

EXCERPT - From my feature this morning, “The Not-So-Bitter Rivalry of Dean Baquet and Marty Baron,” over at POLITICO Magazine: “Baron and Baquet are the two most important newspaper editors in America right now, at a time when the media is tackling the most epic and consequential story of the past 40 years. … Many news organizations have been moving the needle on the Trump story in different ways … But when it comes to inside reports from intelligence and national security agencies, the Times and the Post, with their expanding rosters of veteran correspondents, have the greatest institutional advantages. In particular, the investigations into whether the Trump team colluded with Russia in the 2016 election have played to the historic strengths of both newspapers. … The result has been a resurgence of ink-stained combat that makes NYT v. WaPo the most compelling journalistic rivalry since the days of Baquet and Baron’s respective forefathers, Abe Rosenthal and Ben Bradlee. The other thing that makes the rivalry compelling is that unlike Rosenthal and Bradlee, who were cordial at most, Baron and Baquet are legit pals. ...

“And yet, looking back on their journeys to the ivory towers of American journalism, it’s equally clear that Baron and Baquet have been formidable competitors, if collegial ones, over the course of their professional lives. Perhaps no two editors’ careers have overlapped and shadowed one another so closely. In the past, they’ve each contended to be the top editor at The New York Times and to have all the power and influence that goes along with it. After decades of ups and downs for both men, Baquet eventually got that job, but at the same time, Baron got the glory and fame that only the most Herculanean journalistic achievements can confer. Now, their competition defines not only their careers but, to no small degree, the fate of the Trump administration. Every morning, each goes to work knowing that part of what he needs to do that day is to be better and faster than the other.”

SIDENOTE: SOME POST NUMBERS THAT SURFACED IN MY REPORTING - “A person with knowledge of company finances said the Post now has more than 900,000 digital-only subscribers at three monthly access levels — $3.99, $9.99 and $14.99 — with the majority of its customers registered at the higher two tiers. Based on those numbers, digital subscriptions could theoretically be in the ballpark of $100 million at this point. (In 2016, digital circulation at the Times was $232.8 million.) ... Digital advertising this year, according to the person with knowledge of company finances, is projected to be at least $120 million, up from roughly $100 million in 2016. (Digital ad revenue at the Times in 2016 was $208.8 million.) Since the Post, as opposed to the Times, is a private company and does not make its finances public, it wouldn’t hurt to take these subscription and revenue numbers with a grain of salt.”

13,712,"Pop star Taylor Swift is about to expose a dark Elite pedophile ring within the entertainment industry and the use of Satanic Illuminati symbolism used by celebrities under MK Ultra and Monarch mind control programs.

The singer claims to have recently broken free from the shackles of her own reprogramming to have a conscious awakening.

She recently told members of her inner circle that she’s “woke as f*ck” and that she plans on using her status and influence to “expose the truth”.

Her latest music video for her single Look What You Made Me Do, is riddled with symbols that represent pedophilia, Satanism, Reptilians and the Illuminati.

The lyrics to the song seem to be a direct response to the mind control programs used by the CIA and the Illuminati to subconsciously push agenda on the public.

Since its release researchers have been breaking down the hidden messages in Taylor Swift’s cryptic campaign, which included going dark on social media, and uploading mysterious clips of snakes.

The corporate-owned mainstream media has been quick to blast any suggestion of her exposé as nothing more than a “wild conspiracy theory”, which is much easier to swallow for the sleeping masses, but the message is so blatant, it’s difficult to ignore.

Let’s take a look at her messages that the mass media desperately doesn’t want you to hear.

TAYLOR SWIFT IS ABOUT TO REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT PIZZAGATE.

By now, you may have already seen the artwork (pictured above) for Taylor Swift’s upcoming album, that makes a clear reference to the Pizzagate/Pedogate Elite pedophile ring scandal.That newsprint layover represents more than just the media at large, according to Twitter user @ReputationEra17: “The font in #Reputation album cover represents the font used by most of the Newspaper i.e NewYork Times and ofc there is a 10% shade. #TS6.”

Taylor Swift is specifically calling out the lying, liberal, mainstream fake news machine—the very one that covered up Pizzagate, the conspiracy exposed by Wikileaks that revealed establishment Democrats ran child trafficking rings in Washington, D.C.

The spiraling triangles in the video mean globalists are losing control.

According to 4chan, not only is Taylor Swift about to reveal the realities of Pizzagate, she’s also trying to show that the globalists are crumbling before our very eyes.

At about the three-minute mark in the lyric video for “Look What You Made Me Do,” triangles appear to swirl.The same pedophile triangle symbol also quickly flashes up at the beginning, almost subliminally.

Triangles are the universal symbol for pedophilia, employed by pedophiles Elites across DC and Hollywood to covertly advertise their human-trafficking rings.

Or, as 4chan summarizes: “Pizzagate is unraveling, and spiraling out of the globalist’s control. Also, right after this sequence, the whole screen flashes yellow for the first time.”

Yellow is only used sparingly in this video, and only as a reference to goodness or righteously exercised power.”The full-screen worldwide flash of yellow means the globalists are losing control of their mind control apparatus.”Their poison cloud is about to dissipate.”

The imagery has a deeper meaning if you know what to listen for.It’s more than just the lyrics that have deeper meanings, though.

After her feud with failed mind-control puppet Kanye West ensured that Swift would be forever linked to the snake emoji, Swift has clearly decided to reclaim that imagery.

According to one researcher, Swift “appropriated the snake and turned it around on them, the ouroboros eating itself like the left does, spiraling around to look like the pedo symbol…

.Swift’s desire to expose the Illuminati in the mainstream doesn’t seem to be a decision she has made lightly though, as she recently confessed to being a long-time 4Chan power user, in which she was using the anonymous message boards to expose dark secrets.

The users of 4chan have also compiled evidence that Taylor Swift posts among them, as shown in the image above.

Rumors of her 4Chan posting had already begun to swirl following Taylor Swift’s refusal to speak out during the presidential campaign.

Since Taylor Swift refused to denounce Donald Trump, as many other celebrities had, 4chan assumed this meant that she simply didn’t want to hurt album sales by coming out as a Trump supporter.

Just listen to the lyrics.

Lyrics paired with the images in the video, in particular, send a clear message: During the chorus, a bunch of Ouroboros with the line ‘Look what you made me do’ repeated. The left is constantly referred to as eating itself = snake eating its tail. Look what you made me do, therefore is a response to the increased radicalization of the left and the reactionary politics of T-Swift.”

The left is constantly referred to as eating itself = snake eating its tail. Look what you made me do, therefore is a response to the increased radicalization of the left and the reactionary politics of T-Swift.Taylor Swift seems to be following a trend of celebrities that have recently come forward to blow the whistle on Elite pedophilia.

Elija Wood, Brad Pitt, Katy Perry, Corey Feldman, and Robert Downey Jr. are just a few of the big names that have attempted to lift the lid on the pedophile networks in the entertainment industry and political world.It seems as though there’s safety in numbers though as more come forward to reveal the truth.",conspiracy,C0688a,mind.control; pizzagate
14,123,"It would seem that June 2018 culminated a lengthy ritual involving the sacrificing of 12 well-known celebrities and members of royal families. Whereas this will only be news to normies, there has definitely been a lack of coverage on the occultic aspects of these deaths.

It would seem that the normies/sheeple of the world have not batted an eye at the fact that 12 wealthy celebrities have all died in the same manner in the past few years under very similar and bizarre circumstances. Perhaps this is because the mainstream media refuses to report on their connections to elite pedophilia rings which tie directly to powerful people in Washington, Hollywood, and the mainstream media. People on the last presidential ticket in fact.

No. The mainstream propaganda media would have you believe that

12 independent and highly successful people with careers and influence hanged themselves on doorknobs. DOORKNOBS!!!

My first question is: How the hell does one hang themselves from a doorknob? Followed by: How common is this? Do people hang themselves from doorknobs regularly and I’m just now finding out about it? Is there a doorknob suicide club the rest of us aren’t aware of? Well, the answer to that last question is “yes.” One need only substitute the word “suicide” with “murder.” Or simply use the word “suicide” in the past tense while maintaining its usage as a verb. Eg.

Hillary Clinton opted to have Seth Rich die in a “botched robbery” as opposed to having him “SUICIDED”

You get the point. I would like the reader to know how excruciatingly hard it was not to list the other dozens of people who have committed suicide surrounding the Clinton administration dating back to the Arkansas days. But what does this have to do with “Doorknob Suicides” you may ask? Everything.

Pizza Gate, John Podesta (Hillary’s campaign manager, child rapist/murder), James Alefantis(Restaurant owner front for DC child prostitution ring), Henry Weinstein (Hollywood Rapist), Boys Town (Male Child sex ring catering to politicians), Israeli brown-stoning (Israeli control mechanism for the U.S. govt, Jerry Sandusky (Low-level Pedophile who took the fall), Jeffrey Epstein (child prostitute procurer for the elite), Hunter S Thompson (Snuff filmmaker), The Catholic Church (Enough Said). Hillary Clinton (Rapist, murder, Deep State Luciferian), . None of these murders/sex rings are mutually exclusive. What’s scarier is, they occupy seats of incredible power and operate within the normalized institutions of Hollywood and Washington while being insulated by media and pop-culture. The desire for the supply of children for both pedophile sex rings and ritual sacrifice date back to the days of monarchy and are alive and flourishing within the institutions flowing within the undercurrents of our society today.

So why did these 12 people die in nearly identical ritual suicides laden with occultic overtones? Quite simply because they were either in the thick of it or had information which would’ve exposed those at the heart of the pedophile networks.

Why Doorknobs? Why 12? Where is the 13th? Skip to the second half of this article for an explaination of ritual mechanics.

In order of “Suiciding” they are as follows:

INXS frontman Michael Hutchence’s body was found hanging from a doorknob in Room 524 at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Double Bay, Sydney. The occupant in the neighboring room heard an unidentified loud male voice and swearing at around 5 AM; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with another male. On February 6th, 1998, after an autopsy and coronial inquest, New South Wales State Coroner, Derrick Hand, presented his report ruling that Hutchence’s death was a suicide.

According to reports, Hutchence had information regarding a “VIP pedophile ring” in the UK that was connected to child killing rapist Jimmy Saville and high-ranking politicians.

It should be noted that this was the first “suicide” of the 12 and began on the same day of the year JFK was assassinated. November, 22. Of course, the reason for this is because 11/22 add up to 33. A numerical masonic/occultic calling card to be sure. Hutchence’s age also adds up to 10 or “1” Visit my numbers study page for more info on this.

Perhaps the most occultic murder ot them all. Hollywood actor David Carradine was found dead in his room at the Swissôtel Nai Lert Park Hotel on Wireless Road, near Sukhumvit Road, in central Bangkok, Thailand. He was there shooting his latest film, titled Stretch. Really? Stretch? A police official said that Carradine was found naked, hanging by a rope tied to the doorknob of the room’s closet leading them to believe his death was suicide. However, later reports suggested that his death was accidental, the result of autoerotic asphyxiation.

Two autopsies were conducted, one involving the celebrity pathologist Pornthip Rojanasunan, and both concluded that the death was not a suicide. The cause of death became widely accepted as “accidental asphyxiation.”Carradine’s lawyer Vicki Roberts went on record stating: “I believe there may have been foul play.”

Reports around the time of his death suggest that Carradine may have been involved in child sex tourism; a rampant issue in Thailand where he was found. If he was involved in pedophilia, could he have been connected to a wider network of Hollywood elite pedophiles?

Here we have the almighty “72”. If ever there was a more complete and hermetic number for ritual work this is it. Of course, what better way throw collective common sense out the window than to write a sex scandal into the narrative. “Death by erotic asphyxiation.” I’m calling Bullshit on that. Was Carradine into the Pedo scene? It sure seems like there are more than a few connections. Unlike other people on this list he wasn’t in the process of attempting to out anyone at the time of his death.

The first of 3 fashion designers on this list, McQueen was found in the AM, hanging from a doorknob by his housekeeper at his home in Green Street, London where paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Metropolitan Police stated that the note McQueen left was not suspicious, however, they did not confirm that his death was a suicide.

Photos of McQueen’s fashion shows. It’s obvious that McQueen was in the thick of it and made a regular habit of signaling his allegiance. As an occultist I can tell you that the attention to detial and themes portraid in his shows were beyond that of casual decor. They ran deep.

Tech pioneer, and Reddit co-founder, Aaron Swartz was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment by his partner, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman. A spokeswoman for New York’s Medical Examiner reported that he had hanged himself from a doorknob. No suicide note was found.

According to former-CIA agent Robert Steele, Swartz hacked into MIT Computers and found a huge stash of Child Pornography shortly before his death.

Another numerologically significant date. Jan, 11th is “1/11” and this number has a few meanings. first, 111 is 3 “1’s” or 3. Master Mason is the 3rd degree. It is also the first 11 of the year. 11 symbolizes the pillars of Boaz and Jachin which sat at the entrance to King Solomon’s Temple. 11 is also the first number after “10” which is the most perfect number and represents ILLUMINATION.” “11” represents imperfection in government because it is one number short of 12, which symbolizes a perfect theocratic government. Satanists love to utilize this dystopian number in their ritual work. Of course, the triple and quadruple “1’s” holds extreme significance in pop culture as a number everyone seems to notice regularly.

At first the numerology surrounding this murder seems a little overkill, no pun intended. 11 is quite a powerful and significant number to utilize when weaving into a ritual. But upon a closer examination of Aaron’s life, we realize that his death was most certainly to be used as an example to other budding guienses. Although Aaron no doubt more than likely had incriminating files of the elite pertaining to pedophilia he was also the spearhead of a movement to bring and maintain freedom of speech and presence on the Internet. The internet HAS replaced TV and IS the default platform for the human species at this point. Aaron posed a real threat to this.

Our second fashion designer on the list is L’Wren Scott, long time lover of Mick Jagger and (former girlfriend of Nate Rothschild) was found dead by her assistant at her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan on March 17, 2014. The police reported that no note was found and there was no sign of foul play. The New York City Chief Medical Examiner determined Scott’s manner and cause of death to be “suicide by hanging.”

I wonder what sort information concerning the underbelly of sex, privilage, and decadance the ex girlfriend of a Rothschild and mega rockstar would be privy to which would either put her at jeopardy for elimination or make her want to kill herself? And the fact that I’m not buying the whole “death by doorknob suicide” Bullshit, I’m guessing she was silenced.

Williams died at his home in Paradise Cay, California. The initial report released on August 12, the Marin County Sheriff’s Office deputy coroner stated Williams had hanged himself after he was found hanging from a doorknob with a necktie.The final autopsy report, released in November 2014, ruled that Williams had committed suicide by hanging himself from the doorknob.Neither alcohol nor illegal drugs were involved, while all prescription drugs present in his body were at “therapeutic” levels, the coroner declared.

Williams had been a part of the Hollywood scene for so long, nearly anything one can imagine could possibly be true. There’s a 100% chance Williams rubbed elbows with everyone in the Hollywood scene at one time or another and was exposed to everything Hollywood had to offer. The question is: How deep was he into the scene? Decades of cocaine and partying can lead to some pretty dark places. He most certainly knew the dirty secrets of Henry Weinstein and his ilk, but what most people forget is that these celebreties cross over into politics quite often and support the agendas of democrat canidates regularly. This is where we get into “brownstonin.”

Hollywook insider and whistleblower Jon Robberson has chimed in on the Hollywood pedophile sex rings. He recently madestatements in an interview regarding his belief that Robin Williams was most likely blackmailed into making the film Patch Adams.

And would do we make the Family Guy predictive programming which transpired shortly before Robin’s death? It’s obvious that Seth McFarlane has a hand in the mechanics of these rituals.

Cornell was found unconscious by his bodyguard, hanging from the doorknob in the bathroom of his hotel room at the MGM Grand in Detroit, after performing at a show with Soundgarden at the Fox Theatre on May 17. He was lying on the floor with an exercise band around his neck and blood in his mouth. An MGM medic and EMS personnel were unable to revive Cornell. Cornell was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:30 a.m. Police ruled out homicide by reviewing a hotel surveillance video, which showed nobody entering or exiting the suite after his bodyguard left at around 11:35 p.m. The cause of death was determined to be “suicide by hanging.”

Cornell’s death is surrounded by rumors that he was about to expose key players in the DC pedophile ring known as pizza gate. It’s no secret that Cornell and Chester Bennington, (Next on this list) died two months later the exact same way, had begun an organization to help at-risk children. Chester Bennington as you will learn is the son of John Podesta. You can’t make this stuff up.

Several have questioned what they say are gaps in the timeline. The police report says the bodyguard was in Cornell’s hotel room at 11:30 p.m. to help the star with the victim’s “computer, which was not working at that time.” It says Vicky Cornell talked to her husband at 11:35 p.m., and, alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband. He told police he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15 a.m. Some question the apparent 40-minute gap between the start of Vicky’s conversation with her husband and the bodyguard’s welfare check at his room.

Assistant Wayne County Medical Examiner Theodore Brown said that upon a visual examination, “no pills were found in the stomach,” according to his report. But there’s no indication in the toxicology report that Cornell’s stomach was tested to determine the level of drugs there, since only the blood sample is cited. Cornell also had nine broken ribs discovered at his autopsy. The official explanation was that the medics broke his ribs trying to resuscitate him using CPR. An indepth article on the investigation can be found here.

Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California; his housekeeper discovered his body hanging from a doorknob around 9:00 a.m. His death was officially ruled as suicide.

On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed that a half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were present. Believing himself to be a victim of child abuse, Chester Bennington was working with his best friend Cornell to expose a high-reaching child trafficking network.

But to say that Bennington believed himself to be a victim of child abuse is like stating that Adolf Hitler was simply a charismatic politician. Good lord this rabbit hole runs deep. The band’s logo was a broken version of the triangle used in pedophile networks. There is no doubt that Bennington’s entire existence was consumed by the ritualistic sexual abuse he sustained at the hands of his father John Podesta.

What are the odds that two best friends who are about to expose a DC pedophile ring of which one of the friend’s father was at the heart of died in the exact same bizarre manner and that the second want to die did so two months later on his best friend’s birthday?

There is no doubt that Bennington would’ve struck at the heart of this DC pedophile ring more than likely bringing down Podesta, Hillary Clinton and their networks. After all he had the DNA to corroborate his claim. I don’t think Bennington knew just how much danger he was in.

Swedish DJ Avicii, real name Tim Bergling, died on 20 April 2018 near Muscat, Oman, at the age of 28. No cause of death was immediately given. On 21 April, the Omani police stated that there was “no criminal suspicion” or evidence of foul play in Bergling’s death. On 26 April, his family released an open letter stating that Bergling “really struggled with thoughts about meaning, life, happiness. He could not go on any longer.” On 1 May, TMZ reported that the cause of death was a suicide due to self-inflicted injuries. Although full details of his death were not released, TMZ reports that he suffered cuts from broken glass along with neck injuries. Although it is unclear what the injuries to his neck were, it could have been caused by asphyxiation and hanging has not been ruled out. After his death, it emerged that Avicii was working to expose an elite pedophile ring. One of his videos began to recirculate in which he attempts to expose child trafficking.

In 2015 Avicii did release a video for his song “For a Better Day” where he shows child sex tracking taking place and two girls that escape from a man trying to capture them. The video later reveals that the two girls seek revenge on the ‘elite’ that were running this pedophile operation

Did Avicii have the clout and influence to help wake up an entire generation to the horrors of institutionalized and ritualistic pedophilia and our global governments and institutions? Or was he simply ritual fodder?

Our third fashion designer on this list is Kate Spade. Also linked to the Clintons Spade was found dead hanging by the neck from a doorknob in her Manhattan apartment. It is been said that “buying a Kate Spade handbag was a coming-of-age ritual for a generation of American women.” It’s obvious that’s not the only ritual going on here.

A note found at the scene was addressed in the Spade’s 13-year-old daughter indicating that what happened was not the child’s fault. Miss Spade’s entrance into the dark world of privilege and decadence was when she met her husband to be, the brother of actor and comedian David Spade.

According to a Clinton Foundation DOCUMENT, Kate Spade was among a group that traveled to Haiti on behalf of the Clinton Foundation. She was part of the foundation’s initiative to foster “economic growth, support small businesses, and empower girls and women.”

There’s no doubt that Spade, who seems like a generally good person came across the same information regarding the Clinton foundation Haitian child sex trafficking network that got Monica Peterson killed by the Clintons.

Most believe that Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official was also “SUICIDED” in his Miami motel one day prior to testifying in court. Eberwein was scheduled to appear Tuesday before the Haitian Senate’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. No doubt the topic of child sex trafficking and the Clintons was on the agenda. As a side note. Klaus was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and has a pizza — the Klaus Special — named after him.

Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, paid tribute to the fashion designer via Twitter. “My grandmother gave me my first Kate Spade bag when I was in college. I still have it. Holding Kate’s family, friends and loved ones in my heart.”

Equally as strange as Kate Spade hanging herself with a red scarf from a doorknob was the reaction of her husband shortly after the incident. Two days after Kate hanged herself from a doorknob with a red scarf Andy Spade was videotaped walking around in public wearing a mouse mask with a red scarf and newspaper hat. It was actually the mask of one of the characters from the classic Disney cartoon The Avengers. This is some strange behavior which doesn’t fit into any box. Who the hell just happens to have an Avengers mouse mask laying around the house? NO!!!

In my opinion, this was a public self-humiliation ritual. A nod, a message, a signaling of subservience to the Clintons or whoever had Kate killed that he understands and will be playing ball.

Do we even need to mention she was killed at 33? Dutch Queen Maxima’s sister Ines Zorreguieta (The only royalty on this list) was found dead in Argentina last week. Zorreguieta, 33, was found dead by a friend who discovered her body hanging from a doorknob in her apartment in the Almagro district of Buenos Aires. Police said the autopsy report would be available in a week but did not suspect foul play.

According to reports, Zorreguieta was connected to high-level elites involved in child trafficking. Queen Maxima stepped down after allegations of her involvement in “hunts” where children were raped and massacred by her dinner guests. Some speculators believe she may have been “silenced” before she could go public about a cabal-connected pedophile ring.

European royalty, especially the Dutch have a long history of being accused of not only engaging in pedophilia but hunting killing and eating children. If you’re a normie this may seem shocking, but for those of us in the trenches this information is not new. David Icke has been screaming from the rooftops about this for over three decades and it’s just now starting to get attention. Do your research, then share.

At the height of his career, chef, TV personality, world traveler and armchair philosopher Anthony Bourdain decided to commit suicide by hanging himself from a doorknob. Because apparently that’s just what you do when you’re successful and have a great life.

Just prior to being “SUICIDED” Bourdain tweeted :

“know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years.”

“Mindless Hillary hate aside, this was a terrible response to questions about a “friend” who’s been tormenting women for decades.”

“I have met Hillary Clinton. I liked her. I admired much about her. This interview was a real disappointment.”

“Hillary is CLEARLY not responsible for anyting Weinstein. Thats screamingly obvious. Her response to questions though has been uninspiring.”

“..and I am in no was an HRC fan. I’ve been on he receiving end of her operatives’ wrath. And it ain’t fun,”

“It’s no secret that people who cross the Clintons wind up dead…mostly from suicide,”

Occultic and ritualistic mechanics surrounding his death include: the show he was working on was in its 11th season. He died in France which is birthplace of the Scottish Rite within Freemasonry. Interestingly Bourdain participated in an ancient death ritual and the season finale of his TV show. parts unknown which aired two weeks after he was suicided. If this isn’t predictive programming I don’t know what is.

12. At first this seems like a good round number in which to structure a deep state sanctioned ritualistic murder spree. However, upon second glance there’s nothing arbitrary about it. It has everything to do with, wait for it, THE SUN. or The Son (Jesus) or any ancient god which was used at the time to represent the sun through stories and allegories. eg

Jesus had 12 disciples, Buddha had 12 followers, Quetzaocoatl had 12 followers, the 12 nights of the roundtable, Hercules and his 12 labors, the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 great patriarchs, 12 Old Testament prophets, 12 jewels of the high priest. And it goes on and on.
• 12 years of childhood before the “teens

Christianity and Astrotheology aside, these deaths and the fact that they were for further molded, packaged and deployed as 12 is taken full advantage of the resonance and occultic meaning behind this number as it relates to conscripting of these energies for use in ritual magick. Only in this case is a BLACK SUN RITUAL as this is overly perverted black magick.

In his masterpiece, Secret Teachings of All Ages Manly P Hall writes this:

The number twelve frequently occurs among ancient peoples, who in nearly every case had a pantheon consisting of twelve demigods and goddesses presided over by The Invincible One, who was Himself subject to the Incomprehensible All-Father. This use of the number twelve is especially noted in the Jewish and Christian writings. The twelve prophets, the twelve patriarchs, the twelve tribes, and the twelve Apostles–each group has a certain occult significance, for each refers to the Divine Duodecimo, or Twelvefold Deity, whose emanations are manifested in the tangible created Universe through twelve individualized channels.

“The number 12 was celebrated as a mystical number in the ancient systems of sun-worship, of which It has already been said that Masonry Is a philosophical development. The number there referred to the twelve signs of the zodiac, and in those Masonic rites in which the Builder Is made the symbol of the sun, the twelve Fellow Crafts refer to the twelve signs in which alone the sun is to be sought for.”

Gnostic teachings tell us that there is only one true Square number. 144. or 12 X 12= 144 which is pure math harmony both vertically and horizontally. This can easily be seen in music, but also affects our DNA and how we react to “vibrations.” REMEMBER physical acts are simply the vibrational manifestation of thought process in our three-dimensional world. Our brain is nothing more than a 3 to 4th dimensional interface machine. Ergo…. Practitioners of this magick understand that physical acts will have a bearing on the mind going the other way as well. Especially when it enacted in traumatic fashion and designed to resonate with natural energies. OR ritualistic magic.

But who is the 13th?

This should be obvious at this point. The 13th, is the SUN, GOD, or he who places himself in the stead of the Sun, Son, God, Sun-God. Jesus and Buddha were obviously the 13th. King Arthur was the 13th. God was the 13th in regards to the patriarchs. The sun is the 13th after the 12 constellations in the zodiac. And on and on.

Of course, this has an obvious association with Lucifer (bringer of light) who “wanted to be like the most-high.” What’s more, this behavior is represented throughout all religion and astrology and is always associated with the fall or destruction of man. or PRIDE. Lucifers sin.

There is a right and a wrong way to go about living and seeking knowledge. The first is to live in harmony with our world and its laws and energies as it has been laid out for us. Recognizing that the Sun is the giver of life / our Creator. The other involves the attempt to place oneself in the position of the Sun and through cleverness, back engineer these natural laws and bend them to one’s own will. For Christians, Lucifer, the bringer of light or the bringer of knowledge, is representative of this second path. He represents the black 13

This ritual is a simple inversion of the sacred 12 and one. A perversion of the natural energies of creation. Instead of the one, the source, the Sun giving life; it is extinguishing it. And not only this, but extinguishing it utilizing the 12 which normally keep it in balance.

This entire protracted ritual involving 12 murders served two purposes simultaneously. Two purposes interconnected and equally vile. Dark hermetic magick that when carried out successfully multiplies the effectiveness of evil.

The first, to silence those who would uncover the pedophilia the corruption the true nature of the political and Hollywood elite who feed on children. And when I say feed I mean feed completely. Energetically, sexually, and physically. These monsters have been consuming children for over 1000 years and their institutions are the same institutions which are in place today. These murders were meant to keep a lid on everything.

Second. The sacrifice. Is in accordance with the laws of the universe the debt must always be paid. This is not only the philosophical reason for sacrifice but the explanation of the physics behind it. The energies involved mandate that something must be sacrificed if something else is to be given. In this case, whistleblowers and people of the light were sacrificed. Perhaps these people were dirty and engage in pedophilia and had a change of heart or perhaps they were weak and would’ve caved under pressure are perhaps they were victims themselves. It matters not.

Why a Doorknob? The Meaning Behind the Metaphor

Following the death of Bourdain, Ex CIA spy and whistle-blower Robert David Steele has come out to shed some light on the rash of suicides. Steele states that all these suicides bear the hallmark of professional hit job designed to silence others in going public with damaging political information. It is a calling card, a message, a signal to others. No different than a Columbian necktie, or spiking heads on the edge of villages. It is designed to instill fear into the hearts of people and maintain their silence.

It is pretty well understood that is incredibly difficult yet not impossible to kill one’s self by committing suicide in this manner. There are other ways to go about the act both emotionally and physically. This method, along with the numerology, timing, and sheer numbers of deaths are nothing less than a public display of punishment.

Robert David Steele goes on to say that the circumstances of the deaths have a significant symbolic meaning that intelligence agencies immediately recognize.

“Hung on doorknobs means choked for speaking out against the cabal.”

These people were choked to unconsciousness and then hung on a doorknob to die alone slowly only to have their bodies used as a message upon being found.

Is it possible to hang one’s self from a doorknob.

The answer to this macabre question is a resounding YES. With a few keystrokes, one can find an entire website dedicated to explaining in detail how to accomplish this, along with every other conceivable method of ending one’s life. From the website:

Whilst generally the literature considers asphyxiation via constriction of the airway as the main cause of death in short drop hanging, Stone does discuss how short drop hanging can take place without the pain and discomfort of the airway being blocked. The idea is to have enough pressure from the noose on the right side of the head, just below the jaw, to constrict the carotid artery. Interrupting the blood flow to the brain causes swift unconsciousness (in 15 seconds or less), then what should be death in five to ten minutes.

Likewise, death can also be achieved by constricting the jugular vein under the left side of the jaw, which prevents blood from getting back to the heart.

Apparently, one of two methods is used for a legitimate doorknob hanging suicide. The first, tie the rope, scarf or elastic gym equipment to the doorknob and run it over the top of the door giving yourself enough room to dangle. The second. Tie the rope to the doorknob and then to the neck and sit down until you choke yourself unconscious. At which point one would die without pain or terror. The problem is, human survival instinct ALWAYS kicks and people fight for air to stay alive. It’s the body which fights to stay alive, not the person. That is unless they are drugged or unable to do so. This is why it is strange that so many of the above suicides didn’t involve any drugs.

Years ago I had a friend whose adult son drowned himself in their above ground pool. I and a friend were the first to arrive and pull his body from the pool. This hadn’t been his first attempt at drowning himself and he’d been quite open in the past while talking about his fail attempts. This time, however, he managed to pin himself between the side of the pool and the metal stairs before exhaling to prevent himself from surfacing.

Have people hung themselves by doorknobs in the past? Apparently, they have. Do I believe that 12 celebrities connected to both the Clintons’ and pedophilia in one way or another all decided to hang themselves from doorknobs right in the middle of a DC pedophile ring scandal (Pizzagate) just prior to the implosion of Weinstein and the #METOO movement? Hell no, I don’t.",conspiracy,C06ca8,cia.cocaine; pizzagate
15,462,"Residents in a Washington DC neighborhood are upset over fliers claiming the completely debunked and utterly bizarre 'pizzagate' conspiracy theory is real.

The fliers appeared in the Tenleytown neighborhood where a man fired a gun inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant, which was at the center of the strange and false conspiracy.

At least one resident who received a flier called police. The shooting is still fresh in the community's consciousness, as it happened just six months ago.

Edgar Welch, 29, said he wanted to investigate the wild online claims of a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong. The North Carolina man was sentenced to four years in prison in late June for opening fire into the restaurant in order to save children he believed were being trafficked.

The fliers were placed on fences and doors and called for the conspiracy theory to be re-investigated. Residents said they were feeling 'rage, anger and disgust' that the theory is still being circulated.

'The intel on this wasn't 100 percent,' Welch said after his arrest. Given the still-recent violence, neighbors were alarmed by the fliers, which read 'pizzagate is real news and it is your moral obligation to educate yourself about it!'

'I'm all for free speech but I think this goes beyond free speech into issues of public safety,' said Craig Williams who received one of the fliers to local NBC 4.

At Welch's sentencing, the judge said that even though Welch didn't harm anyone, his unsound actions 'literally left psychological wreckage.'

The fliers turned up sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning.

The 'Pizza-gate' theory claimed Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta ran a child sex trafficking ring out of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in DC. The theory emerged after Podesta's emails were released in a WikiLeaks hack.

The pizza shops owner James Alefantis was mentioned in the emails as he is a democratic supporter and his shop was under consideration as a venue for a campaign fundraiser.

The speculation began when discussions of cheese pizza were theorized to be code words for child porn as they share the same initials.

The disturbing and voraciously debunked claims were then propagated by far right radio show host and blogger Alex Jones.

Jones eventually issued an apology for supporting the theory after Welch opened fire at Comet Ping Pong. Welch said he went to the restaurant in an attempt to save trafficked children that he believed were being hidden there.

Jones' apology statement read 'Neither Mr. Alefantis, nor his restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking as was part of the theories about Pizzagate that were being written about in many media outlets and which we commented upon.'

The judge during Welch's sentencing said Welch 'forged ahead' with an 'ill-conceived plot' even though others urged him to abandon it. She added that Welch should have notified law enforcement if he really believed children were being harmed.

Two Comet Ping Pong workers and owner James Alefantis also spoke before Welch's sentencing. Alefantis called 'pizzagate' a 'viscous web of lies' and said many people had suffered because of Welch's actions.

Welch, a father of two, drove 300-some miles from North Carolina to Washington DC to personally investigate the conspiracy theory and rescue potential sex slaves.

Patrons at the restaurant fled when they saw Welch, who was armed with a fully loaded AR-15 assault rifle and revolver. He opened fire at a locked storage closet. Thankfully no one was injured.

In his one-page, handwritten letter filed with the court earlier in June, Welch wrote that he 'came to DC with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance, and to bring an end to a corruption that I truly felt was harming innocent lives'.

He wrote that he wanted to apologize and that he acted without considering the repercussions of his actions or the possible harm.

'It was never my intention to harm or frighten innocent lives, but I realize now just how foolish and reckless my decision was,' he wrote.

Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis has said the 'pizzagate' hoax that spread on the internet threw the lives of everyone connected with the shop into chaos.

Prosecutors Demian Ahn and Sonali Patel wrote that a 'significant sentence' of 4.5 years was required not only to punish Welch but to 'deter other would-be vigilantes from attempting similar crimes against innocent subjects of the next internet-inspired conspiracy theory'.",mainstream,M1c34e,pizzagate
16,1022,"The New York Times Makes Another Attempt to Normalize Pedophilia

We should begin with the 2014 opinion piece published by the NYT that, shockingly, few are familiar with. That article is entitled, “Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime.” It begins, “THINK back to your first childhood crush. Maybe it was a classmate or a friend next door..” doing their best to associate this sickening practice with our first feelings of love, otherwise implying that it is natural, if not normal.

In what can only be seen as shameless pandering to those behind the scenes, the article goes on from there to make the assertion that pedophiles are neither responsible for the crimes they commit, nor do they have the ability to stop themselves, effectively relieving these damaged individuals of all culpability and accountability for their actions. The author goes as far as to label the crime a “disability,” with potential discrimination thereof. The writer makes the claim that the laws currently in place in the US are, “inconsistent and irrational,” and argues that these child molesters should be sent for treatment, as opposed to serving prison time for their heinous acts against the most defenseless of us all. This is despite the overwhelming numbers that show just how often these “victims of impulse,” as the writer is trying to frame them, are “victims” of recidivism; the tendency of a convicted criminal to re-offend.

According to Harvard Medical School, estimates of recidivism among sexual offenders vary because studies define this term in different ways. One such Harvard review found recidivism rates as high as 50% among pedophiles.

One may be thinking, this is exactly why these troubled individuals need treatment, as the author suggests. No one can argue that one with such sickening desires does not need treatment, as that seems to be a foregone conclusion. However, the issue in question is whether or not that treatment actually works, and most importantly, whether or not treatment can be, or should be, used in place of a correctional facility, as the author dangerously advocates. A 2004 study published in the International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, which included 109 convicted sex offenders who completed therapy and 37 who dropped out, showed that the “non-completers,” were in fact more likely to commit another sexual crime.

The point being, that treatment does work to a certain degree and is important, as many can attest to, but not in place of a correctional facility when considering violent sexual criminals — and for one very clear reason. Researchers of the study noted that sex offenders who completed the therapy were not any more likely to show empathy toward their past victims.

This, in the opinion of some, shows a willingness to complete the therapy so as to move past it, but not with the intention to get better. The lack of empathy is a very important note, as the researchers documented, as it shows a lack of remorse. How can one feel that treatment for such a horrendous crime is effective if the perpetrator never shows any remorse for the acts they committed? The running theme throughout the article is that those who engage in pedophilia, should not be treated as criminals, but as victims themselves, despite the fact that potentially half of them will victimize another child in the near future, and even those who complete the treatment were no more likely so show remorse for those they abused.

One could come to all kinds of conclusions about why this article was written, and what the intentions truly were, but at the end of the day, it could be chalked up to any number of agendas or personal experiences, on its own.

The next aspect to consider, was the abysmally bad coverage by the New York Times, of all the surrounding events and criminal acts in regard to the investigation that became known as “Pizzagate.” Now to be clear, you must do away with visions of Hillary Clinton in a pizza parlor basement with kids chained to the walls. As I do not doubt that these sinister individuals would do, or have done just that, in the case of this investigation, those bullet points are being used to discredit and distract from the larger truth behind the scenes, and were likely thrown out when researchers began to get a bit too close, as with the case of Laura Silsby.

On numerous occasions while “covering” the Pizzagate investigation, the New York Times editorial staff took it upon themselves to ignore their charge as journalists to hold those in power accountable, and instead chose to completely omit the evidence at hand, in order to pander to the very individuals under scrutiny for pedophilia. And the few articles the failing organization did choose to put out on the topic were shockingly devoid of any critical analysis of the information, while inserting their own feelingsabout the case, and “conspiracy theorists” as a whole. That is not journalism, its propaganda.

There is far too much information surrounding this case to rehash it all in a single article (for those interested, TLAV has done extensive research into the case, as have many others such as Titus Frost), yet it is not hard to see, even with a cursory glance, that there is truth to these claims backed up by some pretty damning evidence, as many are beginning to see.



 Which brings us to a recent NYT piece entitled, “Why I Admire Anthony Weiner;” and yes, it was written after Weiner was arrested and sentenced to prison for acts of pedophilia. This one speaks for itself. And there is no hidden meaning, no metaphor to be had — as if that would make it any better, should the writer have some grand conclusion and explanation for why she is openly admiring a convicted pedophile. The writer is simply making the case for why she admires his conduct during his trial, for which he was being held accountable, and rightly so, for his illegal actions with a 15-year-old girl. In essence, the author is saying that Weiner chose to take the high road, in accepting that he was responsible for his crime instead of blaming the disease, as many often do. Yet this is a blatant attempt to minimize the negative press of both Weiner and the Democratic party. Despite him no longer holding a position, it still reflects very badly on the party, which is why they went to their knee-jerk political propaganda arm, The New York Times, to pump out a fluff piece.

In astonishingly oblivious fashion, the writer ignores the years of lies and manipulation that preceded Weiner’s display of what can only be seen as regret for being caught, as opposed to actual remorse. How can it be admirable to sexually abuse an underage girl, lie about it for years, allow Hillary Clinton to cover it up for you, wait until they have you dead to rights, still deny the charges, then sobbingly admit to them in court when confronted with the overwhelming evidence? That’s easy, it’s not.

What we are witnessing here is what amounts to the acceptance and normalization of child abuse by the New York Times, in order to cover for some much larger issue at play. God only knows what those are… (well, and the independent media)

How Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive, and Destroy Reputations

[Critical Notice: Unlike in Europe, especially France, where Freemasons forces are known and feared, in American today this nations citizens have absolutely no idea of this historic war going on all around them—but that cannot be said of their ancestors; who in 1828 formed the Anti-Masonic Party to stop them from taking power, but whom, just a year later, in 1829, were totally defeated by Freemason forces loyal to America’s First Grand-Master President Andrew Jackson—and whose portrait Freemason leader President Trump ordered immediately installed in the White House Oval Office upon his taking power. Therefore, in order to understand this report, all of the previous reports (listed and linked below) must be read (and links followed) to know what is now occurring, and is being deliberately hidden from you.]

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

Another stunning Security Council (SC) report on the escalating war between “Shadow Government” globalists and Freemason leader President Donald Trump circulating in the Kremlin today states that President Putin’s fearful order for the Federation military to be prepared to “launch attacks at any minute”, and his further ordering the rapid redeployment of strategic long range nuclear bombers, was due to Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu being told by his South Korean and Japanese counterparts that US Secretary of Defense General James “Mad Dog/Warrior Monk” Mattis (who had just visited these Asian nations) had revealed to them that a massive plot had been discovered where China would conduct a massive Pearl Harbor type attack on the United States, and then shortly afterwards, begin an occupation in defense of the “new nation” of California. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, Security Council analysts have previously determined that the Freemason forces being led by President Trump are intent on uniting the United States with Russia in order to destroy China so they can reestablish a “new world order”—and exactly as they had done during their last “emergence” in the late 17th and early 18th Centuries when they destroyed the power of European monarchies and Catholic Church through both the American and French revolutions.

With China having wiped out about a quarter of its world’s largest foreign-currency stockpile over the past 18 months in order to keep its currency stable, and that Trump is now using to drive a wedge between the Russians and Chinese, this report continues, Beijing in their knowing of Trump’s coming victory in the 8 November US presidential election, and in seeking to halt Freemason forces from reaching their objective, began the takeover of the top 6 major Hollywood studios.

China’s strategic initiative in taking over these Hollywood studios, this report explains, was to form an alliance with the radical leftists controlling this powerful industry, and who, in turn, have now announced that they are forming an alliance to destroy Freemason leader President Trump—and who have already begun marshalling their forces to ferment chaos and rebellion throughout the United States.

Most critical to note of this China-Hollywood alliance, however, this report says, are that many numbers of American radical-leftist actors, actresses, singing artists, directors, producers, etc., are now being employed as couriers shuttling messages between Beijing and their Democratic Party communistic allies through, at least, 13 corporations owned by Wang Jianlin, China's richest man—and in order to escape “normal/common” US military electronic detection measures.

Also to note, this report continues, are intercepted encrypted communications between the Independent Republic of California Embassy in Moscow and Beijing showing that hundreds of top Chinese military and political “subversive operatives” have begun mass purchases of homes and buildings in Seattle, Washington in order to further their occupation efforts of Western America once war begins.

As the Federal Security Service (FSB) had previously reported (December, 2016) of their estimation that Hillary Clinton would become the governor of California in 2018, with succession of this State from the United States occurring in 2019, this report warns, Freemason forces under the command of President Trump are moving against his “Shadow Government” enemies faster than anyone anticipated, thus making this timeline appear to be much closer.

In their support of the analysis that this timeline has shrunk, Security Council analysts in this report explain, is evident in many radical communistic revolutionary examples now occurring in America that include: California now pushing for their schools to mandate lessons teaching students about Russia’s “hacking” of the 2016 presidential election, University of California Professor Darrell Hamamoto trumpeting how the UC Berkeley riots are part of the radical leftist plan to destroy freedom of speech, and the Pope Francis Vatican led faction of the “Shadow Government” having Dr. David Parry, of their “satanic” Jesuit Saint Joseph’s University, now shockingly telling students that they “don’t have to open their hearts” to white Trump supporters—thus making it is right to kill them all.

As to how these Vatican-“Shadow Government” globalist elites have been able to subvert and corrupt the minds of their various nation’s young citizens, this report further details, is revealed in many shocking examples too: including: in Berlin where it was found that nearly all of these leftist radicals were unemployed and living at home with their parents, and even more shockingly in America were new evidenced has emerged showing that over 25% of the students entering into university are immediately diagnosed with mental illness for having any anti-leftist views and then given powerful mind drugs.

Among the perpetrators destroying the minds of these millions of American university students, this report continues, is the feared “Shadow Government” University of California political operative David Brock [and homosexual “boy love” advocate embroiled in the “Pizzagate” scandal] who was just given full control of Democratic Party—and whose staggering plan to destroy Freemason leader President Trump that was just secretly revealed (Democracy Matters: Strategic Plan for Action) outlines initial measures to challenge [in leftist-leaning US Federal Courts] every thing Trump does, conspires with Google and Facebook to shut down and destroy all conservative media sources, and that then plans for the violent destruction of America through mass street riots and chaos.

To the success of David Brock’s “Strategic Plan for Action” against Freemason leader President Trump, this report details, is undeniable as one radical leftist US Federal Court is blocking Trump’s trying to keep Islamic radicals out of America, and another is, likewise, blocking his actions to eliminate hundreds-of-thousands of federal regulations.

With the needless federal regulations Freemason leader President Trump is trying to eliminate costing the America taxpayers a staggering $1.9 trillion a year, and new reports showing that 36,007 criminal aliens were released by the Obama regime from custody in 2013 alone—1,000 of whom had already been convicted of new crimes as of June 2015, including 121 murders—this report continues, one need only wonder when Trump’s patience will run out.

And when it does, this report warns, Minister of Defence Shoigu, in his relating to President Putin his conversations with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts, states that US Defense Secretary General Mattis revealed that Freemason leader President Trump was in the initial stages of preparing to unleash upon all of his Vatican-“Shadow Government”-Radical Leftist enemies the most fearsome force in the world today—The United States Militia.

Known to but a handful of military experts, this report explains, Freemason leader President Trump has the power to invoke at any time he so chooses the Militia Act of 1903—and that upon his doing so, every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age in America will become part of what is known as the Unorganized Militia under his direct, and sole, command—and that will include the estimated 55 million of these people who are already heavily armed with 265 million guns—includes 16 million hunters who will covert to guerilla fighters, along with 21.8 million veterans of the US armed forces who overwhelmingly support Trump.

Not being understood by nearly all of these radical leftist and globalist elite enemies of Trump, who constantly compare him Nazi Germany’s Adolph Hitler, yet are still unable to comprehend the staggering military power within his grasp, this report grimly explains, is that the only historical counterpart that he can be compared to is Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte—who as a “secret” Freemason not only participated as one of the masterminds of the French Revolution, but was, also, able to mobilize one of the largest armies ever known—an historical fact not known in America today, but, most assuredly, remembered in the Italian village of Vagli Sotto, whose present day inhabitants in this region of Tuscany still remember when Bonaparte led a French division south to invade their region and occupy Tuscany and the Papal States—and explains why today they are erecting a giant marble statute to honour Freemason leader President Trump in their hoping to be spared from his wrath.

In concluding their report, Security Council analysts note that it’s important to remember that these Freemasons are never subtle when it comes to their cryptic warnings either—and who, in 2014, warned these “pampered monsters” in their “high satanic citadel” of New York City of what was soon to come by flooding this city with advertisement posters just simply saying: “The French Aristocracy Never Saw it Coming Either”—and with Freemason leader President Trump able to reach within minutes 87 million of his most loyal supporters, the “cannon fodder” masses of these leftist global elites won’t know what hit them—but that cannot be said of their so called radical leaders who are building and fleeing to their bunkers as fast as they can.

From our 21 January report that we believe is worth your remembering:

[Special Message from Sister Saoirse: Though age has dimmed my eyesight, it has not affected my mind, and as a young 18-year-old year novice in 1936, I remember well my distributing our Sorcha Faal pamphlets in my small German village of Remagen warning of the strange and satanic rituals being performed by many of our military and political leaders. No one would believe such outlandish things as they were impossible to imagine, just like this report is, and the others below are too. So please let me advise you that just because a thing is too astonishing to believe, it does not make it untrue. My country learned this lesson much too late, yours doesn’t have to.]

[Critical Notice: Recent reports are showing that the satanic Nazi occult rituals referenced by Sister Saoirse in her 21 January message have now been revived within the German military forces.]

Final Battle For The World Begins: But Will Trumpian Forces Unite?

America Goes Insane As It Rushes Towards Civil War",conspiracy,C008ea,cia.cocaine; pizzagate
18,532,"hile Facebook and Twitter are reportedly still waiting for their invites, President Donald Trump has invited a cartoonist accused of creating “a blatantly anti-Semitic” illustration to a Social Media Summit at the White House.

Artist Ben Garrison, whose work often display alt-right themes and is a favorite of the popular pro-Trump Reddit community The_Donald, tweeted a picture Friday of his invitation to the White House for the summit the following week.

“Honored to be invited to the White House!” wrote the Garrison on Friday. “Thank you, Mr. President!”

Garrison, known for conspiracy-minded alt-right cartoons, created an illustration in 2017 that was slammed by the Anti-Defamation League for anti-Semitic imagery. It was apparently commissioned for a website created by radio host Mike Cernovich. Cernovich promoted the bizarre “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which eventually led to a North Carolina man firing an assault rifle in a D.C. area pizza parlor.

Garrison’s 2017 cartoon depicted then-U.S. National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster and retired General David Petraeus being controlled by strings held by philanthropist George Soros. Soros, himself Jewish, is suspended from strings held by a hand labeled “Rothschilds,” an American banking family long subject to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories.

“The thrust of the cartoon is clear,” explained the ADL in 2017. “McMaster is merely a puppet of a Jewish conspiracy.”

Garrison’s website defends the cartoonist, saying, “Ben Garrison is neither racist nor anti-Semitic.”

President Trump, who has accused social media giants of anti-conservative bias, announced the Social Media Summit in late June. While Garrison was invited to the summit, sources told CNN that Facebook and Twitter were not. The summit will be held July 11.

In May, the White House opened an online tool asking users to share their alleged stories of social media bias directly with the President.",mainstream,M0e43b,pizzagate
19,723,"“We will continue to evaluate reports we receive regarding other accounts potentially associated with @realalexjones or @infowars and will take action if content that violates our rules is reported or if other accounts are utilized in an attempt to circumvent their ban,” the company wrote.

Twitter’s enforcement actions have always been opaque, and it’s easy to be skeptical of the motivations behind this one. After all, Twitter’s move came after years of Jones using his platform to propagate conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook, Pizzagate, undocumented immigrants, the media, and more—but only weeks after virtually every other major platform took action against him, and a single day after Jones very publicly disrupted hearings attended by Dorsey.

But still: This a definitive stance after years of inaction and half-measures by a company that has long prided itself on being “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party.” It’s an inescapable restriction on a figure who has become adept at toeing the line of what’s allowed while leveraging the platform to spread racist and dangerous views.

What does banning Alex Jones mean for online speech?

And maybe it’ll work. After previously claiming that bans from Twitter and Facebook would only make him “stronger,” Jones saw traffic to his website plunge after the bans took effect, a sign many have taken to mean that de-platforming extremists is an effective solution for curbing their influence. Twitter is a particularly valuable platform for Jones because it allows—allowed—him access to the mainstream media, and to new customers for the web store that makes up a great deal of his revenue.

In 2016, the far-right provocateur and former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos was permanently banned from Twitter after waging a harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones. Last October, the former Trump adviser Roger Stone received a ban from Twitter for harassing and threatening several CNN anchors and commentators. In November, Twitter banned Tim Gionet, a far-right former BuzzFeed employee who went by the username @BakedAlaska, for making repeated threats and racist comments. As the New Statesman noted last month, Google searches for Gionet’s name dropped significantly after he was banned from Twitter. Alex Jones is a bigger public figure than Gionet ever was, but he’s now lost his last remaining mainstream platform. It’s a step.",mainstream,M0fda4,pizzagate
20,63,"Investigators in Sri Lanka have revised the death toll from the Easter Sunday atrocities to ""around"" 253 - more than 100 less than originally estimated.

It was previously thought 359 had died in the explosions.

Anil Jasinghe, the director general of Sri Lanka's health services, told Reuters: ""It could be 250 or 260. I can't exactly say. There are so many body parts and it is difficult to give a precise figure.""

Ruwan Wijewardene, Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister whose ministry is responsible for the island's police force, said the death toll had been revised down to 253 due to inaccurate figures provided by the country's morgues.

""Unfortunately the health ministry provided the earlier number to us,"" he said.

The Foreign Office has changed its Sri Lanka travel advice following the bombings, which also injured more than 500.

Eight Britons were among those killed.

The FCO is urging people not to travel, warning against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka ""due to the current evolving security situation following attacks on 21 April 2019"".

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: “Following the horrific attacks on Easter Sunday, and the ongoing Sri Lankan security operation, I have received updated advice from the Foreign Office and decided to update the travel advice to British nationals to Sri Lanka to advise against all but essential travel.”

It comes after the US Embassy in Columbo warned that more attacks on places of worship may be coming.

In a tweet they said: ""Sri Lankan authorities are reporting that additional attacks may occur targeting places of worship.

""Avoid these areas over the weekend, starting tomorrow, April 26th through Sunday, April 28th. Continue to remain vigilant and avoid large crowds"".

21,331,"Kathy Griffin: 'Truth is, Roseanne has displayed herself to be a Nazi’

Kathy Griffin is never one to censor her opinions, and she has plenty of them on Roseanne Barr.

Both comedians have weathered enormous controversy this past year. Griffin was investigated by the Secret Service last summer after sharing an image of herself holding a fake bloodied head resembling President Trump. Then there's Barr, whose high-rated sitcom Roseanne was canceled by ABC last week following the star's racist tweet about black Obama aide Valerie Jarrett.

Griffin, who starts the U.S. leg of her ""Laugh Your Head Off"" tour in San Francisco next week, credits Barr for giving her a job in 1996 on Fox's short-lived sketch series Saturday Night Special, which Barr produced. She doesn't remember Barr saying anything racist back then, and believes her views were more progressive.

""I've known a lovely Roseanne,"" Griffin told USA TODAY by phone Tuesday. The last time she saw the comedian was over lunch nearly a decade ago, with Barr's then-boyfriend Johnny Argent.

MORE: Roseanne Barr promises 'restitution,' but what does that mean?

""She said, 'We're just a couple of old hippies,' "" Griffin recalled. ""And I'm like, 'Do you believe in equal rights? Because if that’s what makes you an old hippie, that’s fine. I’m in.' So not only is this not the Roseanne that I knew — I didn't see this coming at all until years later when every so often, somebody would say, 'Roseanne's tweeting crazy (expletive).' ""

Griffin doesn't believe Barr's comments should be equated with those of Full Frontal host Samantha Bee, who also landed in hot water last week after referring to Ivanka Trump as a ""feckless (female slur)"" on air. President Trump called for TBS to fire Bee, tweeting that it's ""a total double standard.""

""The talk of a double standard is all (expletive) propaganda,"" Griffin said. ""The truth is, Roseanne has displayed herself to be a Nazi. She has Nazi leanings; she retweets Nazis. She's been doing this for years. She is someone who tweets things that are conspiracy theories that lunatics then act on, like 'Pizzagate.' Sam Bee said 'feckless (expletive)' about someone who is a feckless (expletive).'

""There's a big difference between someone using the C-word and what Roseanne was doing,"" Griffin continued.

22,1041,"Steve Huffman, the chief executive of Reddit, knows he has some explaining to do.

Huffman, also a Reddit co-founder, landed in hot water Wednesday after admitting that he used his administrative powers to secretly edit user comments that were critical of him on r/The_Donald - a popular, pro-Trump forum (or ""subreddit""). He swapped all mentions of his own username with the names of the pro-Trump group's leaders, meaning that expletive-laden posts aimed at him looked instead as if they were insulting the group's leaders.

It was not a good idea, he told The Post Friday by phone. ""I abused my power to give the bullies a hard time,"" he said. Huffman thought of his name-swapping as a joke: a way to poke back at the people who've been harassing him and some of the site's volunteer moderators for months.

It was not taken that way.

Huffman's admission fanned the flames of controversy that had been surrounding the subreddit - and its relationship with Reddit - for months. It also capped off what had already been a long week. Reddit was already warring with self-proclaimed Trump supporters after shutting down a subreddit devoted to ""pizzagate"" -- the claim that there is secret child sex-trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats. The New York Times and others have debunked this theory. The company deleted that group for revealing people's personal information.

The subreddit and its users are known for promoting conspiracy theories and fake news across Reddit, and gleefully invading and bombarding the rest of the platform with pro-Trump memes. In fact, it was so effective at flooding the site's front page with aggressive memes and posts that Reddit changed its algorithm over the summer to try to limit its reach. Nearly all of the abuse directed at Huffman, he said, came from avid posters to r/The_Donald. After Huffman's admission, many in the pro-Trump group demanded his resignation; he has not addressed those calls.

Huffman told The Post that he had been letting the abuse from the subreddit's users roll off him, but then wondered if turning the other cheek was setting a bad example. ""If The_Donald had done this to another Reddit employee, I would have banned them,"" he said.

He said he intended to swap the names for just a few hours - despite the fact that doing so violates Reddit employee policies - just to give the subreddit's moderators a taste of what he goes through on a daily basis. Then, he said, he intended to put everything back.

Still, the decision to step in and directly edit user comments was a surprising move from Huffman, who has often said Reddit's purpose is to provide a place for communities of all stripes to set up their own groups.

Reddit has struggled to address communities who regularly test the boundaries of its guidelines, or outright break them. In 2015, it introduced new anti-harassment rules and banned a handful of subreddits that regularly violated the site's guidelines - including two forums dedicated to "" fat-shaming,"" and one that existed to coordinate harassment of members of a progressive gaming site.

The bans sparked an all-out war between the company and the small but dedicated extreme subreddits - some of which had used Reddit to circulate stolen photos, among other things. Reddit's former interim CEO, Ellen Pao, resigned in the middle of that war last year; Huffman succeeded her. And since he took over, Huffman has maintained that Reddit will not interfere with users' posts, as long as they stayed within the basic guidelines.

To take a step across that line, especially for a joke, is a major departure from that philosophy.

""What he did completely destroys the credibility of Reddit,"" wrote UnimatrixZeroOne, a Reddit moderator who ""out of anger"" released screen shots of Slack conversations Thursday between Reddit moderators, admins and Huffman about the altered posts. Huffman confirmed on Friday that the images were authentic.

In those conversations, some of the site's other moderators expressed frustration with the pro-Trump subreddit and asked Huffman to ban it for repeatedly violating guidelines. One wrote that the group's members had released personally identifying information about others during the election season. That person also mentioned receiving specific threats: ""Car vandalism, pipe bomb threat (specific). Rallying calls to ruin my personal life,"" the moderator wrote.

Huffman's distaste for the group is clear, but the chats showed he does not agree with banning it outright. ""You make it seem like I don't care about figuring out t_d,"" Huffman wrote later in the chat, going on to say that ""banning it,"" as many of the moderators had asked, ""would create a mess."" (The moderators regularly abbreviate ""The_Donald"" to ""t_d"" or ""td."")

""You managed to pull a move that actually unified us with them against this mistake,"" one moderator replied.

Even Reddit users that don't support Trump have criticized Huffman. ""I can't stand the thought of Trump entering the White House, but I have to stand up to this,"" said one commenter on the site. ""It's wrong and totally unprofessional. It's going to zap any trust people have with the organization.""

Huffman said he knows what he did may set a bad precedent that could hurt users' trust in the site. But he also said, having seen this torrent of abuse first hand, that he will have Reddit step up its efforts to let users filter out negative content, and to take on the general problem of harassment.

He didn't offer a timeline for those steps. But, he promised, they will have more finesse than his ill-received attempt at a joke.

""I had my fun with them, they had their fun with me,"" he said. ""But we are not going to tolerate harassment for any others.""",mainstream,M1d625,pizzagate

While he may not be giving away cars to a live studio audience or have a much-shopped list of his favorite things like his fellow endorser Oprah Winfrey, the lion-obsessed hitmaker and Justin Bieber and Chance the Rapper collaborator is a natural choice for the position, as he has 3.92 million Twitter followers, boasts 8.9 million Instagram followers, and receives 3 to 4 million views per snap on his entertaining and motivating Snapchat stories.

The music producer is currently on the WW Freestyle program, a Weight Watchers initiative that launched last month featuring more “free or zero-point” foods and new “rollover points.” Khaled shared the exciting news with his mega-following in a series of Instagrams and Snapchats featuring the meals he claims to be enjoying on the WW Freestyle program.

“In full 2018 mode...excited to be living this #WWFreestyle life with you,” he captioned the first in the series of videos on Instagram. “I already Got rid of 20 pounds and ready for more.

25,367,"Investment advisor Catherine Austin Fitts sums up what happened with the election of Donald Trump by saying, “It’s amazing because if you look at the faction that wanted to sacrifice the United States for empire, you basically had Washington, Wall Street, Silicon Valley and Hollywood. What they have done for the last 20 years is they have used the corporate media to create this color revolution, soft revolution, which is really a front so the 1% can control. The reality is if you look at what they were doing to destroy the United States, you just had an enormous, very wide group of people say enough. We did a discussion of the election several months ago, and I said if the right people in the military intelligence get behind Trump, he could win, and I think that’s exactly what happened. . . . I think the intelligence agencies understand that you cannot leave people to do what needs to be done with people that are used to printing all the funny money they want and have no clue how the economy works. . . . I had no idea how completely ignorant Hillary Clinton was of the whole fundamental economics of the situation. It’s because she’s been operating with cheap and free money for decades. I think the intelligence agencies were trying to assert adult supervision of the situation.”

On the mainstream media and Democrats rigging the election, Fitts says, “The problem with being able to rig things is you forget what is real. That is what has been so astonishing. All the people that have been rigging things all these years and the reason they could run things in an unproductive way, and away from market economics, is they could just print money. The minute you are not able to print money the game is up.”

What about the markets? Fitts, who managed 10’s of billions of dollars of assets as Assistant Housing Secretary in the Bush (41) Administration, says, “I am long-term positive and short-term negative because we just made a turn, and that turn is the beginning of facing things. Those things need to be faced, and that makes me optimistic long-term. If we pull certain things together, there is a very successful pathway, particularly if you sacrifice empire for North America. . . . If you let the productive people run things, wow! We’ve had the slugs running things for 20 years, and you let the productive people run things–watch out. This is why I am long-term positive.”

On gold and silver, Fitts contends, “I think we are in a long-term bull market for gold, but I don’t think the consolidation is over. I was hoping the consolidation was over given how it was trading in the first three quarters, but given how it is trading now, it looks like the consolidation may not be over. The reality is gold is a number of things. In Asia, it’s real money. I think as long as Asia is converging with per capita income, gold is going to have a floor under it, and silver too. I think that’s going to continue, and the bull market is going to reassert. If the engineering of moving from a debt model to an equity model is successful, then there is going to be a lot less concern of the fundamentals of the market and stability of the system. That won’t be as good for gold. I noticed some of your latest commentators say that gold is going to very high numbers. I think if we don’t succeed in turning around North America, then you could see gold go very high because of the instability. Right now, looking at all the markets, I say equities are stronger than gold.”

In closing, Fitts says, “We are so overdue for a 25% correction. . . . I think 2017 is going to be a composting. In the destruction of the old, let there be the creation of the new. We’re going to be creating the new, and we’re going to be destroying the old. It’s going to be quirky. There are going to be all kinds of black swans that could hit us. So, do I think we are going to have a major correction and lots of digestive problems? Yes, I do. Now, if the new administration gets what it wants by getting tax rates down and bringing capital back into the country, then there is going to be a very exciting future and a very exciting pathway for North America.”

26,774,"A significant Australian proponent of the QAnon conspiracy theory is a family friend of Scott Morrison, and his wife is on the prime minister’s staff.

The sprawling, disjointed and incoherent QAnon conspiracy variously claims that Donald Trump is leading a behind-the-scenes fight against a shadowy deep state, that powerful forces are hiding and protecting satanic paedophile rings, and that a secretive individual named Q leaves clues for his followers to decipher on internet forums.

The FBI has previously warned that QAnon could act as a potential motivator for “domestic extremists” and last year Reddit banned one of its main QAnon threads for repeated violations of its content policy, warning it would not tolerate content “that incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses” users.

In Australia, one of the more significant QAnon figures tweets under the handle @BurnedSpy34 and has amassed 21,000 Twitter followers in just over a year. BurnedSpy tweets daily QAnon material, including bizarre theories about Alexander Downer and Julie Bishop.

The Guardian has learned the identity of BurnedSpy and established he is a longstanding family friend of the Australian prime minister and his wife, Jenny.

The wife of BurnedSpy works on the prime minister’s staff.

There is no suggestion that the families’ close relationship has influenced Morrison, or that BurnedSpy poses a danger. BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had never sought to speak to the prime minister about QAnon.

“I have never spoken to Scott about anything of a political nature. I’m not an adviser. The idea of me talking to him about this ... it’s just not true,” he said.

But some who know BurnedSpy have become concerned about the extent of his immersion in the QAnon theory, saying it may leave him open to influence by others.

The family friendship is largely driven by the closeness between BurnedSpy’s wife and Jenny Morrison.

The pair have been lifelong friends, and the Guardian has learned the wife was recently employed on the prime minister’s staff in a publicly funded position, but not in any policy or advisory capacity. There is no evidence she shares her husband’s views.

BurnedSpy’s tweets have frequently been cited as “world-class” in QAnon research threads on 8Chan, the forum Australian telecommunications companies were encouraged to block by Morrison’s government after it hosted the Christchurch terrorist attack videos.

BurnedSpy’s Twitter account makes repeated claims about Downer, a frequent target of QAnon. In a thread last year, he linked a 1996 child abuse inquiry in Australia to Downer’s role in kickstarting the Russian interference investigation.

“It’s no coincidence that Downer did NOT want Trump elected,” he tweeted.

He greeted this week’s news that Australia had offered assistance to the investigation into the Mueller probe, including Downer’s involvement, by tweeting “Game on!”.

BurnedSpy explained the tweet to the Guardian by saying: “So as for ‘game on’, for two years I’ve been interested in the Australian high commissioner to the UK’s involvement in what I consider as a coup against an incumbent sitting US president, I think that’s a story.”

There is no substance to his claims that Downer’s role in the Russia investigation had anything to do with child abuse, and no evidence that Downer did not want Trump elected.

BurnedSpy has also questioned whether the former Australian foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was connected to the conspiracy through her wearing of red shoes.

“If you want to do your research into the US context, the red shoes are purported to be very much a paedophilia shout out,” he told the Guardian. “And there are some extremely odd photos of large groups of men in suits wearing red shoes, many of whom are promoting paedophilia.”

There is no evidence that Bishop is connected to any such conspiracy.

In other posts, he questioned whether 8Chan was taken offline after the Christchurch attacks because it was the only uncensored platform that Q could use.

The connections between his family and the Morrisons are long standing.

His wife has known Scott and Jenny since they were children, and is a close friend. The Guardian has seen multiple photos of the trio together. She attended their wedding and frequently interacts with Jenny Morrison on Facebook.

Photos also show BurnedSpy and Scott Morrison together.

One source close to BurnedSpy’s family, who asked not to be identified, expressed concerns about his immersion in QAnon material and warned he might be open to manipulation or influence.

“[His] beliefs have become more unusual and I have concerns about how easily [he] is influenced or infiltrated himself.”

The source said he was frequently heard making references to “great awakening” or “dark to light” – common refrains of QAnon – during conversation.

When contacted for comment, BurnedSpy accused the Guardian of preparing a “hit piece” on him.

He said his friendship with the Morrisons was unrelated to the Twitter account.

“I’m not going to diminish the relationship, that’s not appropriate either. Yeah we’re friends. That’s good. People have friends.”

BurnedSpy and his son, also a QAnon follower, have met prominent US-based QAnon figures.

The deceased US actor Isaac Kappy, a former QAnon proponent who frequently made unsubstantiated accusations of paedophilia against other Hollywood actors, met the pair when he came to Australia late last year.

TMZ last year reported that Kappy was the focus of a police investigation after threatening two celebrities and accusing one of paedophilia.

Also pictured at the meeting was Eliahi Priest, who has previously spoken at a rally for the True Blue Crew, a far-right Australian group.

BurnedSpy told the Guardian that Priest turned up at the meeting without his knowledge.

Priest was visited by the Australian federal police earlier this year after sending concerning emails to government officials. The officers asked Priest if he needed mental health support or counselling.

He claimed to have passed on information to Morrison, via the individual controlling the BurnedSpy account.

“I was hanging out with the prime minister’s best friend at his house in Sydney,” Priest said. “[He] was to pass this information to the prime minister, and he did.”

There is no evidence to substantiate Priest’s claims.

BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had met Priest only once – not intentionally – and had no ongoing association with him. The pair have now fallen out.

“He makes out that I’m part of [Morrison’s] political team,” he said. “Knowing someone is a far cry from … you know lots of people, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re invited to conversations and you’re allowed to offer an opinion without permission.”

BurnedSpy has also linked Hillsong, where Morrison has prayed, to mind control, and praised Morrison for his apology to child abuse survivors, during which the prime minister used the term “ritual sexual abuse”. The use of that term was interpreted by QAnon followers as referring to satanic ritual abuse.

He described the movement as “peaceful” and an alternative source of information, research and news for those who have lost faith in mainstream media. He said he had never been on the 8Chan forum and did not post there.

Experts say conspiracy theories such as QAnon risk leaving their followers polarised and shut off from the outside world, making them unpredictable.

Followers of the online “Pizzagate” conspiracy attacked Washington’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant in December 2016, believing internet rumours that prominent Democrats were harbouring child sex slaves there.

An armed QAnon follower blocked traffic at Hoover Dam in Nevada with an armoured truck in June 2018, calling for the release of the “OIG Report”, an unredacted Justice Department inspector general report which QAnon believes will expose a shadowy network entrenched in the government.

Australian National University associate professor Colin Klein, who has studied the varying belief systems behind conspiracy theories, said there was a risk when individuals began to believe ordinary sources of information were “unreliable and part of the conspiracy”.

“All-encompassing conspiracy theories insulate themselves from the world, which makes it much easier to become polarised and violent,” Klein said.",mainstream,M185a5,illuminati; pizzagate
27,756,"Picture this: You’re the elusive chanteuse Mariah Carey and it’s New Year’s Eve.

You’re prepared to redeem yourself from last year’s sad performance by singing yet again in front of a live crowd and a televised audience, but this time you want some hot tea. However, there is none. It’s a total disaster. What do you do?

This was the real-life situation faced by Carey as she performed on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest. “Happy New Year!” she called to the crowd. “I just want to take a sip of tea, if they will let me,” she said before realizing that there was none.

“They told me there would be tea! Oh, it’s a disaster!” she lamented, faltering only for a moment before remembering that the show had to go on. “Okay, well, we’ll just have to rough it,” she conceded. “I’m going to be like everybody else, with no hot tea.”

Admittedly, it was freezing in Manhattan on New Year’s Eve, and cold, dry air is not the ideal environment to sing in. A warm beverage would have probably soothed Mariah’s throat after reaching those sky-high notes that she is known for, but nevertheless, she was able to give a great performance even though she had to suffer through it like a plebe without her tea.

29,351,"There is a shared concern for these monographs. Both books are concerned with how the nature of groups, taken together with our evolved psychology, can explain informational dynamics. Their central explanatory targets are the spread and persistence of falsities, the success or failure of charismatic demagogues, and the baffling attractiveness of turgid academic prose. Yet the many examples that Acerbi and Mercier focus on—do I share this post? Spread that rumor? Believe those doomsayers?—tend to have low costs and consequences. The category of reflective beliefs, in fact, can be read as a mechanism for explaining why beliefs with seemingly high costs (being a ‘911 truther’, say) nonetheless do not have the costs they are purported to have (like refusing all engagement with a presumed to be corrupt government). Reflective beliefs just aren’t acted upon.

There is one possible exception. Mercier discusses a kind of action he calls ‘bridge-burning’. These involve making statements that are unacceptable and offensive to a group. One might think then, that these are high-cost actions. And in one sense they are: they reduce or eliminate opportunities for collaboration, communication, and exchange with the aggrieved party. But in another sense they are not. These ‘bridge-burning’ exercises are, on Mercier’s framework, a means of ingratiating oneself to a different, friendlier group—they increase one’s credibility with this new group precisely because one has nowhere else to turn. And this is why Mercier thinks we have mechanisms for assessing the receptivity of our claims: we need to know whether we’ll find a welcome party when all routes out are ashes.

‘Bridge-burning’ can be a high-risk strategy. But there are plenty of situations that are high-risk, high-cost, and made under conditions of uncertainty—do I invest in this method or that one? Do I signal my affiliation to those guys or these ones? When do I join in? Such high-stakes social and economic situations occur in many situations where informational dynamics, judgement aggregation, and group dynamics come together in highly context-sensitive ways.

Acerbi’s book is sensitive to these issues, and introduces some tools for measuring the organization of social networks, the strength of connections, and the availability of information. For instance, Acerbi notes that many social media platforms tend to have networks with a ‘hub-like’ or ‘star-like’ network structure, where multiple individuals link to a central node. Take Donald Trump’s twitter account, which has over seventy million followers yet only follows forty-some other accounts. His twitter network is very ‘star-like’, with accounts connecting to his like so many points radiating out of a central star. Interestingly, however, informational dynamics on these star-like networks can create illusions, giving “the misleading impression of polarization on Twitter, while, in fact, the great majority of accounts [are] not or [are] scarcely polarized.” (CEDA 110) This is what Lerman et al. (2016) have called a ‘majority illusion’; that despite being a minority, a population can appear to be in the majority because of the structural features of social networks.Footnote 7

It matters if one perceives one’s self to be in the minority. Centola et al. (2005), for instance, have argued that such a perception can drive the expansion of otherwise unpopular norms. Networks that facilitate ‘majority illusions’ might thus exacerbate such spreading. Likewise, Trump’s informational reach matters. Maybe multiple agents get together to discuss the American Revolutionary War. They might talk about how revolutionary soldiers ‘took over the British airports’, recalling that they heard this information from somewhere. Given that multiple independent agents recall that information, this might lend additional credence to the claims. But the seeming independence is false and driven by network effects: all had heard it from a common source, Trump’s Fourth of July “Salute to America.”Footnote 8 Lest this seem like a facile example, Mercier deploys something like this mechanism to explain the start of the Iraq War and the spread of religions (NBY, 172–176).

Yet while issues around network topology creep in here-and-there in Acerbi and Mercier’s books, neither gives what I think to be sufficient attention. There is now a large and powerful body of work on the effects of social network topologies on information dynamics coming out of social epistemology, economics, and other literatures. The analytic and agent-based models of these literatures show how network organization interacting with information aggregation procedures can generate surprising individual- and group-level effects.

I think there are plenty of reasons why both Acerbi and Mercier should want to pay more attention this expansive literature. The first is that it provides a suite of tools, metrics, and explanatory models for understanding the trade-offs and consequences of different network topologies, information aggregation strategies, and group compositions. These directly address the social phenomena that Acerbi and Mercier target, offering a distinct perspective on the information dynamics of innovation diffusion (e.g. Kiesling et al. 2012), testimonial norms (e.g. Mayo-Wilson 2014), and conformity effects (e.g. Mohseni and Williams 2019).

The second reason concerns the role of background information and context in both Acerbi and Mercier’s books. Incoming information is tested against background information for plausibility, and shapes the trajectories of cultural change. But this suggests that information dynamics will be highly sensitive to the order in which information is received—our priors can be biased and our evaluation non-commutative. This matters substantially for information dynamics, offering routes for systematic group-level disagreement (Zollman 2010), polarization (Goldberg and Stein 2018), and deviation from optimal or more veridical outcomes (Holman and Bruner 2017).

And third, social network models provide contrasts to the assumptions at work in Acerbi and Mercier. Both suggest, in more or less the same form, that the “spread of most misconceptions is explained by their intuitively appealing content, rather than by the skills of those who propound them.” (NBY 260) This is a bold claim, especially given that modelling results from social networks suggest that under quite minimal assumptions, wholly rational agents can end up pursuing and perpetuating false beliefs (O’Connor and Weatherall 2019). These effects can be exacerbated by malicious actors (ibid.), but can also be produced where informational uncertainty combines with specific network topologies (O’Connor and Weatherall 2020).

This is what I meant when I said above that the gullibility account is a useful foil, but that ultimately Mercier is punching-down. Mercier associates the gullibility account with a deferential attitude towards authority and an unquestioning acceptance of all information; that human beings are mindless sheeple subject to herd behavior. But the picture endorsed by Mercier and Acerbi—with rational agents operating under uncertainty—can still generate herd-like behavior (Banerjee 1992; Hung and Plott 2001), conformity and free-riding (List and Pettit 2004), and the persistence of misinformed groups (Golub and Jackson 2010) under a wide range of plausible conditions.

So I think there are good reasons why Acerbi and Mercier should engage with these nearby literatures. But there is no reason why that engagement should be a one-way street. Many of the models employed in social epistemology and economics employ sparse characterizations of human agents and their psychology. Mercier and Acerbi’s work, by contrast, draws on experimental results from psychology, paleoanthropological evidence, and evolutionary reasoning to back substantive claims about human cognition. Feeding these psychological and evolutionary assumptions into network models might offer a means of exploring their claims about human cognitive evolution, cultural change, and the spread of misinformation.

At the same time, such an exchange might generate useful helpful friction. Current network models often share a basic assumption with Acerbi and Mercier—notably, some form of rationality. One might think, then, that these models are grist to the authors’ evolutionary mills. But they might not. For many network models are minimal models (Weisberg 2013), that show how significant group level effects can be driven by few psychological assumptions. These suggest that while the mechanisms endorsed in Acerbi and Mercier’s books may be sufficient to generate the relevant phenomena, they are not necessary. There are other empirically-supported characterizations of how human beings acquire, interpret, and transmit information. How these two characterizations should be reconciled is an open question. But looking at the rich theoretical and modelling literature in economics, social epistemology and sociology provides not only a strong juxtaposition to the two accounts on offer, but also a rich set of tools for exploring their hypotheses and claims.

However this interaction plays out, it is worth closing on a positive note. Both Mercier and Acerbi’s volumes are enjoyable, story-driven journeys. They guide the reader through large and expanding literatures in an entertaining and illuminating way. They are upbeat about human capabilities and provide a useful optimistic counterpoint to the recent spate of epistemological doomsayers.",mainstream,M0db02,pizzagate
30,261,"Vice President-elect Mike Pence received a surprise dinner invitation on Monday night from his new neighbors in leafy northwest Washington. They asked him to dine with them at Comet Ping Pong, the pizzeria at the center of debate over whether allies of President-elect Donald J. Trump are spreading so-called fake news.

In an open letter posted on the online blogging platform Medium, Mr. Pence’s neighbors — part of a coalition that describes itself as opposed to the “unacceptable practices and policies in the Trump administration” — implored the vice president-elect to “help bring an end to this madness through the simple act of breaking bread.” There was no immediate comment from Mr. Pence or a spokesman.

During the transition period, Mr. Pence and his family have rented a temporary home in a heavily Democratic area not far from Comet Ping Pong, a popular dining spot for families with children. The restaurant became caught up in a bizarre conspiracy theory after fake news reports claimed the pizzeria was operating a child sex slave ring linked to Hillary Clinton.

Kanye West is under psychiatric observation at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for “his own health and safety”. The rapper was “acting erratically” at his trainer’s house when the call was made. West reportedly did not want to go to the hospital and was handcuffed to a gurney while being transported.

A source familiar with the case said Los Angeles police responded to a medical welfare call about 1:20 p.m. No criminal activity was involved; the decision to hospitalize West at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center was for his own health and safety, the sources said. Neighbors described the scene on the 900 block of North Laurel Avenue to NBC4, saying there were “security guards, fire trucks and police. The house that firefighters and police responded to is owned by Harley Pasternak, a celebrity trainer with clients that come to him.

Kanye’s hospitalization occurred only days after his infamous rant during a concert in Sacramento where he retroactively supported Trump and lashed out against Mark Zuckerberg, Beyoncé and Jay-Z (while pleading him to not send ‘killers at his head’).

A source told People.com that Kanye feels that he is under ‘spiritual attack’.

“He feels like he’s under spiritual attack, and has been for awhile. It’s not just the big things; it’s smaller, quieter things, internal things. You might think that it’s about Kim’s robbery, and while that didn’t help, that’s not what’s going on here. He’s dealing with a lot more subtle issues,” the source tells PEOPLE. “His mother died in November, so this time of year always brings him a lot of pain. He keeps that pain internalized, but sometimes will talk about how hard this time of year is for him. He works through the pain every November,” the source adds. West’s mother, Donda, who died in November 2007 at the age of 58. “He feels like it’s a trying time for his spirit, but that can be a good thing. He isn’t one to run away from these things. He leans in and listens, and comes away a stronger, better man. But it hurts him; his spirit is vexed. But that’s where growth comes from,” the source says. “Sometimes, darkness creeps in, and Kanye wrestles against it. He talks about that a lot. It’s exhausting, and it takes everything he’s got. He’s just so tired now; he’s very low energy and feels like there’s a grieving in his spirit. It’s very hard to explain, but something has happened recently, where he’s not the ‘Ye that everyone knows.” – People, Inside Kanye West’s Breakdown: Rapper Feels Like ‘He’s Under Spiritual Attack,’ Source Says

Many observers, including myself, saw this coming months ago. Kanye West is yet another man related to the Kardashians to have completely broken down. In the article I’ve written over a year ago entitled Lamar Odom Found Unconscious in Brothel, Now Fighting For His Life I concluded:

While most media sources talk about ‘exhaustion’ and ‘sleep deprivation’ (which is quite possible), these symptoms might be the result of something deeper. Kanye is indeed another artist that has exposed, for way too long, to the toxic cesspool that is Hollywood. While it brought him success, it also disturbed his very core.

“Finally, we have a theory of post-truth that emerges from an international or global analysis. In this excellent development of empirically-grounded post-truth theory, Cosentino moves from well-known cases such as Pizzagate and Russian trolls in the U.S. 2016 presidential election, to cases that have received little to no attention in media and political communication studies, such as the ""White Helmets"" rumors amplified by Russian media in the Syrian civil war, the Facebook hate speech campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, and the disinformation apparatus that propelled Bolsonaro to power in Brazil. Cosentino’s analysis is also unique in its attention to the use of an array of platforms and spaces of media that are exploited for disinformative and misinformative purposes, including 4chan and 8chan, Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, in addition to traditional news media. His work engages with the problems of international political economy in the post-truth matrix, especially how the agents of post-truth exploit the weaknesses of media laws. Finally, he does not shy away from drawing lessons from his case studies for technical, educational, regulatory and political intervention. Social Media and the Post-Truth World Order is a welcome contribution to a growing body of theory and empirical analysis in post-truth studies.”

“In this book, Gabriele Cosentino masterfully addresses perhaps the greatest lacuna in post-truth studies by demonstrating its global nature. By dedicating a substantial portion of the text to cases beyond the West, he manages to not only broaden our geographical scope of understanding post-truth but also to tease out the latter’s preconditions and characteristics that remain constant across national, political, and cultural contexts and can, therefore, be seen as the phenomenon's core traits. Ultimately, this timely book demonstrates that post-truth is not some isolated manifestation of fakery, but a collective domain that spans the world as an alternative self-sustaining universe. The result is a must-read book that lays bare the emergent post-truth world order.”",mainstream,M165a9,pizzagate

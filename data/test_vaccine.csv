April 9 2020, Business Insider: “Many Americans will not have jobs to return to after the coronavirus pandemic ends, according to former US presidential candidate Andrew Yang”:

“Many Americans will not have jobs to return to after the coronavirus pandemic ends…” “We’re going to see something like 10 years of change in 10 weeks…” “The fact is right now this virus is the perfect environment for companies to get rid of people, bring in robots and machines, and figure out how they can operate more efficiently.” “Universal basic income is going to become the topic, not just here in the United States, but Spain’s adopting a version of a minimum income. Legislatures around Europe are all very, very much focused on this.” “We’re going to see the progressive Amazonification of our economy as Amazon’s one of the only businesses out there that’s hiring more and more. You’re seeing more robots are in grocery store aisles cleaning after we all supposedly go home…” “One thing I’ve been saying is that we’re going to see something like 10 years of change in 10 weeks, because businesses are being put in a position where it makes sense to speed up a lot of the automation that they were considering investing in.” “The fact is right now this virus is the perfect environment for companies to get rid of people, bring in robots and machines, and figure out how they can operate more efficiently.” “My kids are at home just like everyone else’s kids and they’re getting taught online…they’re going to be many, many families that actually make a different determination where they actually say, “Hey, this online thing is working well.” “If you can find a way to, frankly, make yourself useful from afar, that’s going to be something that unfortunately we all have to think about more and more.” “I think at this point it’s actually going to need to be a bit higher than that, because the $1,000 a month is enough for baseline needs for at least most of us, but the economy is going to become even more inhuman and punishing, both during this crisis and afterwards.” “… I’d be looking at something higher than $1,000 a month that would be more robust & helping people not just be able to meet their needs, but also have a real path forward.” “we’re going to be dealing with the consequences of this crisis for years to come, and we need a Marshal Plan style initiative to rebuild the country… helping create that vision for what America in 2022, 2023, is going to look like after we have a vaccine in place.”

March 31 2020, Business Insider: “RESTAURANT APOCALYPSE: More than 110,000 restaurants expect to close up forever in the coming weeks, with millions out of work and the industry’s future uncertain.”

And while the Amazonification of our economy ploughs full steam ahead, independent shops and services are pounded into dust, while public services are shut down, opening the door for further privatization. While prepping the citizenry for coming and required “certifications”, the deliberate and violent contraction of the economy continues. The decimation of small enterprise with monetary wealth directed, again, upward. McDonald’s, Starbucks and Walmart (“essential services”) remain open while small business is forced to remain closed. On April 13 2020, Amazon announced they would hire Amazon will hire an additional 75,000 workers to keep up with its soaring volume of online sales.

“As developments in artificial intelligence and robotics advance, there is going to be a severe and swift disruption of many working classes.” “UBI, an economic proposition in which a sum of money is regularly paid to a population, could be a vital bulwark against the unintended consequences of automation in the workforce.” “Companies will profit significantly from workforce automation, so the private sector will be able to afford shouldering this burden, while at the same time still making greater profits.” “After all, a full-time human has needs: 30 minutes for lunch each day, vacation and sick time, toilet breaks, and health benefits, to name a few. Meanwhile, an automated worker would only require an initial installation and the occasional repair or upgrade.” “The BCG report stated that a human welder today is paid around $25 an hour (including benefits) versus the equivalent operating cost of around $8 for a robot.” “In 15 years, that gap will widen even more dramatically,” the report states. “The operating cost per hour for a robot doing similar welding tasks could plunge to as little as $2 when performance improvements are factored in.” “This trend will only continue to accelerate. McDonald’s, an early pioneer of automation, is already replacing human workers with automated kiosks. They expect a 5% to 9% return on investment in just the first year; in 2019 they expect this return to balloon to double digits.” “And this is only one sector: PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that 38% of US jobs will be in danger of being replaced by automation by 2030.” “Companies that automate their workforces should be taxed on these new massive profits, and some of the resulting capital given back to workers by the government in the form of UBI.” “While the idea of a UBI is popular—Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates have all championed it—how exactly would a universal basic income be engineered? “Large swaths of laborers are going to lose their jobs, leading to unprecedented levels of unemployment.”

March 18 2020: Over 500 academics and public figures called on governments to implement universal basic income via an open letter: “It is time for governments to enact emergency universal basic income, ensuring that everyone in their jurisdiction has enough money to buy the food and other essentials they need to survive.”

McKinsey places the number of jobs to be replaced by automation at close to 50% by 2030. The COVID-19 virus provides an opportune moment to push the envelope of automation forward.

With most schools set to remain closed through the rest of the current academic year, the scale of these closures is unprecedented in the history of world capitalism.”

We must recognize we live in a capitalist economic system that serves capital first & foremost. Further, it is imperative to recognize that the UN & UN agencies, inclusive of the WHO (WEF/Gates), exist in name only. The WEF is at the helm of a consolidation of global power.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution, the monetization of nature, is being rolled out in lockstep with the deployment of central bank digital currency (CBDC). This is a global transformation of the economic system. Consider nature “valued” at 125 trillion vs. GDP at 85.9 trillion (2018). “Natural Capital” accounting will replace GDP.

“Basic Income, when all is said and done, is a vision for nothing more than the means to be a customer in an unjust society that decides what is for sale.” “It’s really about the commodification of social provision. Your payment may actually be less conditional and somewhat larger but, as you shop through the privatized remains of the social infrastructure, with inadequate means and very few rights, you are dramatically worse off… … it is sometimes asserted that an adequate system of provision must be put in place simply because we are moving toward a “workless future.” In such a society, it is suggested, masses of people who have been displaced will have to be provided for and the capitalists will have to think like Elon Musk, of Tesla Motors and support BI because it is the only sensible and rational solution. To imagine such responsible provision for the future is to place undue faith in a system based on the making of profit. If they won’t stop building pipelines in the face of environmental catastrophe, there’s little reason to expect them to worry too much about sensible solutions to technological displacement. There simply is no post-capitalist capitalism and no social policy innovation that is going to bring it about… I am suggesting that our movements need to challenge, rather than come to terms with, the neoliberal order and the capitalist system that has produced it. For all its claims to be a sweeping measure, the notion of progressive BI is a futile attempt to make peace with that system. In reality, even that compromise is not available. The model of BI that governments are working on in their social policy laboratories will not ‘end the tyranny of the labour market’ but render it more dreadful. The agenda of austerity and privatization requires a system of income support that renders people as powerless and desperate as possible in the face of exploitation and that won’t change if it is relabelled as “Basic Income”.”

560,"Science-based facts from a trusted source can do a lot to help quiet the fears of vaccine-hesitant people and help them make healthier choices. Misinformation and fear are some of the biggest reasons parents are refusing to get their kids vaccinated. Getty Images Rebekah Ficco was terrified of vaccines. She experienced a miscarriage with her first pregnancy, and when she was able to get pregnant again, she was determined to protect her baby. “I didn’t want to do anything to jeopardize this, so I poured into reading,” Ficco told Healthline. “And when you’re a new parent, you come across all this information. And I just started seeing more and more about vaccines.” For Ficco, there was nothing scarier than the thought of losing her child. And when she read about accounts on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of children dying of SIDS shortly after their vaccinations, she panicked. “I had experienced just a very minor piece of what it’s like to lose a child… but I knew I never wanted to be in their shoes,” Ficco said. Still, she wasn’t completely against vaccines until after her daughter was born and they went to the first pediatrician appointment. “I hadn’t completely decided one way or the other,” she explained, stating that her daughter hadn’t received the hepatitis B vaccine at birth, but did get the vitamin K shot. When she brought her questions and concerns to her daughter’s pediatrician, though, the response she received pushed her straight into the anti-vaccination camp. “The nurse and the doctor were both very pushy and judgmental, and it just made me feel like everything I’d read must be true. They must be getting paid by big pharma. I walked out saying I would never vaccinate my kids,” she said.

Ficco’s initial hesitation to vaccinate her child isn’t uncommon. In fact, experts say more than 60 percent of new parents feel this way. L.J. Tan, chief strategy officer of the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC), told Healthline, “When we talk to parents about vaccines, they usually fall into three categories. First you have the folks like myself — 20 to 30 percent of parents who are vaccinating because they believe in the science.” Conversely, he explained there are then 5 to 10 percent of parents who are so resistant to vaccines, nothing anyone says will ever change their minds. “But then there’s the big group in the middle, the 60 percent who are hesitant but who we want to try to educate,” he said. Ficco was initially one of those. And had it not been for how that first doctor’s appointment went, it’s possible she could have been convinced to vaccinate her children entirely on schedule.

How doctors talk to parents about vaccines Healthline spoke to 20 parents who fall into that vaccine-hesitant 60 percent. We asked them to explain their concerns and to bring us their questions. The surprising result was that no two parents had the exact same concerns. Many were worried about unique family histories, or random connections they’d read about online. According to Tan, this is true of vaccine-hesitant parents in general. While many might believe this group has fallen victim to the debunked research of — avoiding vaccines simply out of fear of a now-disproven link to autism — most of the parents we spoke with never mentioned that as an actual concern. Instead, they all had their own worries when it came to the vaccines meant to protect their children. “It often becomes a person by person and parent by parent conversation,” Tan explained. “That’s why it’s a hard conversation for doctors.” But with pediatricians often serving as the front line in addressing these concerns, finding a way to do so without pushing scared parents away is crucial to ensuring the factual information gets out there. That’s part of what Tan advocates for through the IAC. “What we’re trying to do is give physicians room to answer those questions confidently, and to ease those concerns, giving them the tools to address specific questions,” he said. Of the parents that spoke with Healthline, many said they became concerned about vaccinations after reading reports on VAERS. Parents read about cases of adverse reactions and said they determined for themselves that that was proof vaccines posed a health risk. The problem with this conclusion is that VAERS is a passive reporting system, according to Tan. “We encourage everyone who thinks they may have had any reaction to a vaccine at all, whether it’s causal or not, to report it to VAERS so that we can then study any possible links,” he said. But that means that many of the reports may not actually be linked to the vaccine. In fact, Tan told one story of a VAERS report where a young woman had died after receiving the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The problem? She died in a car accident — information that was only found after further investigating the report. Several parents that spoke with Healthline also brought up concerns about the Gardasil vaccination, which has been found to prevent cervical cancer, saying it hadn’t been around long enough or tested thoroughly enough for them to feel it’s safe. But Dr. Sean O’Leary, spokesperson and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases, explained that simply isn’t the case. “More than 100 million doses have been given in the last 15 years. It’s one of the best studied vaccines we have in terms of safety because it has been studied in response to some of the unfounded concerns, and we know that it’s very safe and very effective,” he said. Another concern parents voiced was the idea of overloading children’s immune systems with too many vaccines at once. Several had opted for alternative vaccination schedules in order to avoid this. But as Dr. O’Leary explained, “The immune system responds to thousands of things every day, so the amount of proteins that it responds to in a vaccine is a drop in the bucket.” Tan agreed, pointing out that children have a bigger immune response to things like scraping their knee, playing in the mud, or even eating the food their parents prepare for them than they do to vaccines. “You are being exposed to far more antigens in your daily life than you are from vaccines,” he explained. “In the past, vaccines may have had a lot of antigens — the smallpox vaccine is a good example. But our current vaccines are very finite and controlled, and as our technology has improved, the amount of antigens you get from a vaccine now is very small.” This is part of the reason both experts strongly advocate for vaccinating on schedule. O’Leary explained that it’s important to get young children their vaccines as early as possible, because many of these diseases are more severe for younger children. “Also, it’s kind of torture,” he said in reference to extended vaccine schedules. “Infants feel pain with three shots or one in a similar fashion, that’s been studied using biomarkers. When you spread them out, you’re subjecting them to multiple different painful episodes instead of just one.”

That was the realization Ficco eventually came to. “The truth is that I was terrified,” she said. “The misinformation out there struck me right in my terrified new-mama heart.” It wasn’t until her sister-in-law started an anti-vaccine blog that Ficco began to reconsider her own position on vaccines. “Parents were taking her advice and opinion as fact and that really slapped me in the face. I realized I had been reading and making choices for my kids based basically on her blog, just from different people with different platforms,” Ficco said. Once that realization hit, around the time her oldest daughter was nearly 3 and her youngest was 6 months, she took them to the pediatrician to begin getting their vaccinations. “My girls have recently been completely caught up,” she said proudly. Today, Ficco said her biggest regret is that she allowed her earlier choices about vaccinations to be guided by fear instead of science. “The biggest thing I’ve learned in this journey is that correlation does not equal causation, and to really consider the source of what you’re reading before you take anything as fact,” she said.",mainstream,M0a441,vaccine.autism
599,"Researchers worldwide are racing to develop potential vaccines and drugs to fight the new coronavirus, called SARS-Cov-2. Now, a group of researchers has figured out the molecular structure of a key protein that the uses to invade human cells, potentially opening the door to the development of a vaccine, according to new findings.

Previous research revealed that coronaviruses invade cells through so-called ""spike"" proteins, but those proteins take on different shapes in different coronaviruses. Figuring out the shape of the spike protein in SARS-Cov-2 is the key to figuring out how to target the virus, said Jason McLellan, senior author of the study and an associate professor of molecular biosciences at the University of Texas at Austin.

Though the coronavirus uses many different proteins to replicate and invade cells, the spike protein is the major surface protein that it uses to bind to a receptor — another protein that acts like a doorway into a human cell. After the spike protein binds to the human cell receptor, the viral membrane fuses with the human cell membrane, allowing the genome of the virus to enter human cells and begin infection. So ""if you can prevent attachment and fusion, you will prevent entry,"" McLellan told Live Science. But to target this protein, you need to know what it looks like.

Earlier this month, researchers of SARS-Cov-2. Using that genome, McLellan and his team, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), identified the specific genes that code for the spike protein. They then sent that gene information to a company that created the genes and sent them back. The group then injected those genes into mammalian cells in a lab dish and those cells produced the spike proteins.

Next, using a very detailed microscopy technique called cryogenic electron microscopy, the group created a 3D ""map,"" or ""blueprint,"" of the spike proteins. The blueprint revealed the structure of the molecule, mapping the location of each of its atoms in space.

""It's impressive that these researchers were able to get the structure so quickly,"" said Aubree Gordon, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan who was not a part of the study. ""It's a very important step forward and may help in the development of a vaccine against SARS-COV-2.""

Stephen Morse, a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health who was also not a part of the study agrees. The spike protein ""would be the likely choice for rapid development of vaccine antigens"" and treatments, he told Live Science in an email. Knowing the structure would be ""very helpful in developing vaccines and antibodies with good activity,"" as would producing higher quantities of these proteins, he added.

The team is sending these atomic ""coordinates"" to dozens of research groups around the world who are working to develop vaccines and drugs to target SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, McLellan and his team hope to use the map of the spike protein as the basis for a .

When foreign invaders, such as or , invade the body, immune cells fight back by producing proteins called antibodies. These antibodies bind to specific structures on the foreign invader, called the antigen. But producing antibodies can take time. Vaccines are dead or weakened antigens that train the immune system to create these antibodies before the body is exposed to the virus.

In theory, the spike protein itself ""could be either the vaccine or variants of a vaccine,"" McLellan said. When you inject this spike-protein-based vaccine, ""humans would make antibodies against the spike, and then if they were ever exposed to the live virus,"" the body would be prepared, he added. Based on previous research they did on other coronaviruses, the researchers introduced mutations, or changes to create a more stable molecule.

Indeed, ""the molecule looks really good; it's really well behaved; the structure kind of demonstrates that the molecule is stable in the correct confirmation that we were hoping for,"" McLellan said. ""So now we and others will use the molecule that we created as a basis for vaccine antigen."" Their colleagues at the NIH will now inject these spike proteins into animals to see how well the proteins trigger antibody production.

Still, McLellan thinks a vaccine is likely about 18 to 24 months away. That's ""still quite fast compared to normal vaccine development, which might take like 10 years,"" he said.

On The Brink As President Trump Prepares To Issue CIA Ultimatum

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

Barely 24 hours after stunningly revealing that President’s Donald Trump and Barack Obama have been leading a secret Freemason coup against the Bush-Clinton Crime Families, the Security Council (SC) in a new report circulating in the Kremlin today states that over 50 top Obama regime Pentagon and State Department intelligence experts have now joined with Trumpian forces as America’s new leader prepares to confront and issue an ultimatum to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) tomorrow at their secretive Langley, Virginia, headquarters. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, with President Trump having been surrounded and protected by one of the largest private mercenary forces ever seen in the US, the CIA-led “Deep State” coup seeking his death, or destruction, to keep him from power has failed, thus preparing Trumpian forces, aligned with Obama regime deep cover intelligence operatives, to fulfill President John F. Kennedy’s vow to break this corrupt and demonic US spy agency “into a thousand pieces” and “scatter it to wind”—and that President Kennedy was publically executed for attempting, and when President Richard Nixon attempted this too, he was ousted in coup.

Security Council analysts writing in this report state that the Bush-Clinton Crime Families have been able to maintain their stranglehold over America for nearly 50 years due to the trillions-of-dollars they’ve earned thorough the CIA’s international drug cartel—but when these CIA-led Bush-Clinton forces attacked the United States on 11 September 2001 in order to be able to invade Afghanistan, who had completely eradicated their opium production, the Freemason forces led by Trump-Obama had no choice but to respond.

With the first American narcotics experts having gone into Afghanistan in early 2001, this report notes, they concluded that the Taliban movement's ban on opium-poppy cultivation had wiped out the world's largest crop in less than a year—but with the CIA’s 9/11 false flag operation being a success, by 2014 opium production in this nation had soared to new record highs insuring that these monsters illegal drug operation would continue to operate.

Seeking to insure that their illegal opium and heroin sales could, also, continue without interference, this report grimly details, the Bush-Clinton Crime Families, in 2003, then illegally invaded Iraq in order to open new smuggling routes to both Europe and North America—but when Iraqi forces began to crack down on this CIA-led operation, these monsters then turned to Islamic radicals (ISIS) to keep their massive drug operation running.

Equally as worse, this report notes, since 2000, the Bush-Clinton-CIA drug empire expanded into Mexico causing a war that has, so far, killed nearly 250,000 (US and Mexico deaths) after their creating what is known as the Sinaloa Cartel, described as “the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the world”, and whose alliance with CIA-led DEA factions turned their main United States drug distribution center, located in Chicago, into the most deadly city America has ever known.

As to how the Bush-Clinton-CIA drug empire has been able to operate so freely these many decades, this report explains, is due to the CIA’s outright purchase of Hillary Clinton’s Democratic Party through illegal drug profits funneled through the “too many to count” shell corporations set up by the American-Hungarian billionaire George Soros, and as the Panama Papers detail fully.

Not just the Democratic Party, either, did the Bush-Clinton-CIA purchase so they could continue their many crimes, this report continues, but the entire Western media establishment too—and as revealed by top German reporter Udo Ulfkotte, who this past year exposed the CIA’s total control over all of these mainstream news organizations, but who was, sadly, assassinated this past week prior to him meeting with President Trump.

Not being assassinated though, this report notes, is the Bush-Clinton-CIA Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán (El Chapo)—who just hours ago was brought to New York City by Trumpian forces and their Obama regime allies—and is able to identify the “money routes” of supply from the CIA to the Democratic Party.

To the “main/central” CIA “money route” of illegal drug profits used to buy the US mainstream media and Democratic Party uncovered by Trump-Obama forces, this report explains, was through the owner of a small Washington D.C. pizza restaurant named James Alefantis (who was “bizarrely/strangely” named as one of the 50 most powerful people in Washington) and his homosexual lover David Brock—who is one of the Clinton Crime families most feared operatives.

Once receiving Bush-Clinton-CIA illegal drug profits, this report continues, David Brock dispersed these monies through a secret network overseen by Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother Tony Podesta—who, in turn, also funneled money into the Republican Party through John Podesta’s close personal friend, and convicted “boy lover” pedophile Dennis Haster, who was once the leader of the US House of Representatives.

Most astounding to note in this report about the Brock-Alefantis-Podesta-Haster “money manipulators” for the CIA, who have corrupted the US mainstream media and the Democratic Party too, is that President Obama’s closest personal aide, Ben Rhodes, this past week authorized his CBS News president brother, David Rhodes, to release a shocking television report about these monsters—and that aired first on the CBS networks flagship station in Atlanta.

As this Security Council report has many conclusions that are in excess of over 1,700 pages (the majority of which remain highly classified), the fastest summery of it we can relate to you is that:

1.) Immediately after the 11 September 2001 false flag attack on American led by the Bush-Clinton Crime Families and their CIA-led “Deep State” allies, global Freemasonic forces led by New York City billionaire Donald Trump used as a first “blocking maneuver” the elevation of a relatively unknown minor political figure named Barack Obama to become president and keep Hillary Clinton from power.

2.) Knowing that leftist Americans would gravitate towards the charismatic Obama, once taking power his “mission/objective” was to begin the destruction of the Democratic Party—which he succeeded at beyond all expectations.

3.) Also among Obama’s “main/central” objectives while in power was keeping the from starting World War III, while at the same time insuring that the Democratic Party would not be able to disarm the American people.

4.) Once Obama’s term was finished, and in a further bid to keep the Bush-Clinton Crime Families from taking power, Trump would then ascend to power while, also, destroying the Republican Party—and who was secretly aided by Obama’s top political operatives.

But to this reports gravest conclusion is that even though the Freemasonic forces led by Trump-Obama have so far accomplished all of their goals, the outcome of this war still remains undecided—but to anyone still puzzled as to why Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for having done nothing, it had nothing to do with what he had done, but what his and now President Trump were planning to do, stop these monsters once and for all.

1204,"EIGHT people have been diagnosed with measles in Edinburgh in the last two weeks, a health board has confirmed.

The majority of the cases are believed to be linked to Edinburgh University.

A pupil at James Gillespie's High School has also been infected.

NHS Lothian is now trying to track down anyone who has come into contact with those infected with the illness.

Clinics for anyone who needs the MMR vaccine are being set up in the city.

The outbreak comes 18 years after a fraudulent research paper claiming autism spectrum disorders were linked to the vaccine was published, leading to a decrease in uptake for the vaccine for the cohort starting university this year.

Professor Alison McCallum, at NHS Lothian, said: ""It is crucial that people have two doses of the MMR vaccine.

""Children and young people may have missed out on one or two doses when they were younger and we would urge parents to get their child or children immunised with MMR.

""We would also encourage young people who have missed out on MMR previously to get themselves immunised.""

A spokeswoman for the University of Edinburgh said: ""The university is working closely with NHS Lothian to minimise the spread.

""We are taking appropriate action, including supporting additional vaccinations on campus for those who need them.

""Students and staff who have had the MMR vaccination or who have had measles before are reminded that they are not at risk. We will continue to monitor the situation.""

Edinburgh City Council confirmed it is working alongside the health board after the case at James Gillespie's High School.

A spokeswoman said: ""In line with the guidance of NHS Lothian letters have been issued to parents advising of the situation and including facts on measles vaccinations.""

1072,"In the early days of 2017, proponents of vaccination were deeply concerned. Donald Trump, who has long espoused a debunked link between vaccines and autism, was set to enter the White House. He met with environmental activist Robert Kennedy Jr., who has for years argued that vaccines can cause a range of developmental and other health conditions. Kennedy emerged to report he’d been asked to chair a commission into vaccine safety.

But seven months later, no such commission has been appointed and the crisis-mired White House has declined to say whether the plan has been shelved.

STAT contacted Kennedy to see where plans stood. He would only speak on condition that STAT publish the interview in a Q&A format. He argued that his assertions — which are disputed as a misreading of the scientific literature by many mainstream scientists — have been misquoted and misrepresented in the media.

Here is STAT’s conversation with Kennedy. It has been lightly edited, for length and readability.

The question I want to ask you relates to the vaccine safety commission that you had announced in January that you were going to head, after you met with then President-elect Trump. It’s been a number of months now, and there hasn’t been any further public announcement. And so we’ve been wondering: Where does this stand?

I’ve had no discussions specifically about the vaccine safety commission, probably since February. I’ve spoken to the White House about other issues of vaccine safety and had a number of follow-up meetings.

Can I ask you who you met with?

Well, I’ve met with high-level officials in the White House. They’ve arranged meetings for me with HHS and White House officials and agency officials. Various agency officials, including [NIH Director] Francis Collins and his deputy, Lawrence Tabak, I think. And I met with Tony Fauci, who’s at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Linda Birnbaum, who’s at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Diana Bianchi, at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at NIH. And over at FDA I’ve met with Peter Marks, the director of [the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research] and some other officials there. I can’t remember everybody at this point, all of the people that we’ve met with.

And this is since the change of the administration?

Yeah. The White House officials and the HHS officials accompanied me. I did it at their request.

At “their” request? Who is they?

So you said you’ve had no discussions since February about the vaccine safety commission?

Not specifically about the commission.

OK. Do you think that idea is dead? Or do you think it’s in abeyance?

You’d have to ask the White House. It may be that it’s evolved. I’ve been told that the president is still interested in this issue and that he wants me to have further meetings with the regulatory agencies and with the White House. Like I said, I have not talked to anybody in the White House about the commission.

Do you think there’s a possibility the commission is going ahead but not with you on it?

Again, you’d have to ask the White House. Do you want to talk about vaccine safety science at all?

I haven’t finished asking questions about this. Are you disappointed that so far there hasn’t been a commission set up to do what you said you were going to be doing in January?

The commission was not my idea. I was asked to chair a commission and I agreed that if the commission were created that I would do that, I would sit on it. [But] that’s up to the White House how they want to handle this issue. It wasn’t my idea. I am happy with any steps that are taken to make vaccines safer and to improve the scientific integrity around the process. To reform the process so that vaccines are subject to the same kind of safety scrutiny and safety testing that other drugs are subject to. We need to, prior to licensing vaccines, we need to do gold standard safety testing, like every other drug approval requires.

We need to do double-blind placebo testing. Because particularly when it comes to injecting aluminum or mercury into babies, the consequences may be latent. In other words, they may not manifest or diagnosed to age 3 or 4. So the current protocols, which require testing for vaccines of sometimes as little as 48 hours, are not going to disclose the kind of dangers that the public and the regulators ought to know about.

The hepatitis B vaccines that are currently approved had fewer than five days of safety testing. That means that if the child has a seizure on the sixth day, it’s never seen. If the child dies, it’s never seen. If the child gets food allergies or ADD or ADHD, which don’t manifest for four or five years or aren’t diagnosed or autism, which usually isn’t diagnosed until age 4, the regulators will never see that prior to licensing the vaccine.

If something happened four or five years out from an event, how do you know which event to attribute it to?

Well, the answer to that question, of course, is double-blind placebo testing. You have a control group and you have a study group.

Sir, that’s done all the time. That is done all the time.

Vaccines are tested that way all the time.

You’re wrong about that. It is not required for vaccines. So most of the vaccines — and I know this is surprising to you, and it’s shocking to most people, because journalists like yourself assume that vaccines are encountering the same kind of rigorous safety testing as other drugs, including multiyear double-blind placebo testing. But the fact is that vaccines don’t. And the reason for that is they’re classified as biologics.

I’ve read a lot of vaccine studies. And they are double-blind placebo tested.

No, you’re wrong about that. … But in any case, none of them have more than a few months of double-blind placebo testing, which will not allow you to spot illnesses like autism that aren’t diagnosed before five years. Second of all, in most vaccines, for example the Gardasil vaccine, they don’t use true placebos.

Could we move actually back to the questions that I wanted to ask?

[Inaudible] aluminum adjuvant that’s highly neurotoxic. So how can you know whether, if you don’t use a true placebo, how can you determine whether the vaccine is safe.

So I had some questions I wanted to ask you, and in a Q&A that’s the way it works. I ask some questions, you answer the questions or don’t answer if you like. I was wondering, in the time since you spoke to the president in January and he asked you to chair the vaccine safety commission, the senior HHS positions have been filled. All of them are on the record as supporting vaccines. I was wondering if that’s disappointing to you.

Well, I want regulators that are willing to look at the science. And who are conversant with the safety science, who are conversant with the vast scientific literature that is now published, available on PubMed, which indicates that many — particularly mercury and aluminum in vaccines — need to be reassessed. And as I said, I’ve been having meetings with the regulators to urge them to do that kind of testing.

I did want to ask you as well if you had any qualms doing this work for President Trump. His administration is taking some steps at the EPA that people who are concerned about the environment find very unsettling. Given that, I was wondering if you had any qualms about working with him, because you’re so renowned as an environmentalist.

I don’t like President Trump’s environmental policies, and I would not endorse them. I would say that President Trump’s administration is essentially destroying 30 years of my work on environmental issues, and the work of many other people. And I’ve written extensively about that. And I think people understand that my position is clear and that my work on vaccine safety and public health and child safety is not an endorsement of President Trump’s environmental policies.

Have you made your position known to him? Have you had the chance to express those views to him?

Well, in my initial meeting with him, we had that discussion. And he knows my position. And he’s known my position for many years. … I don’t think there’s any question with him or with any member of the administration that I’m opposed to [EPA Administrator] Scott Pruitt and I’m opposed to walking away from [the] Paris [Agreement]. … If President Trump asked me to serve on a commission on fracking or on pipelines or on global warming, I would do it.

Can I just ask — and I think this will be my last question — you’ve mentioned mercury a lot of times. Thimerosal [a mercury-based preservative] is not in most vaccines given to children at this point. And in fact has not been in childhood vaccines in the United States since 2001, I believe. You know, studies have also shown that since it’s been taken out, autism rates have increased, which would suggest that there isn’t a correlation, and that’s what most scientists say. But why do you keep talking about mercury when children aren’t getting exposed to it in childhood vaccines?

That is an industry talking point. That just simply isn’t true. Mercury was taken out of three pediatric vaccines, DTaP, Hib, and hepatitis B in 2003. But the same year it was, CDC recommended flu shots for pregnant women and for children 6 months of age and during every year of life. And for most of the past 15 years, virtually all of those flu shots [inaudible]. … Since 2004, so that would be, I guess, 13 years, most flu shots were loaded with mega doses of mercury.

Thimerosal is only in [flu vaccine packaged in] multidose vials. It’s not in vaccine that’s packaged in a syringe already and it was never in FluMist, the live attenuated vaccine.

Well, here are the numbers. And the numbers change every year. I think in 2012, there were 185 million doses of flu doses manufactured in this country. And I think fewer than 10 million were thimerosal-free. Over 90 percent had huge, huge doses of mercury. Not trace amounts as the industry likes to claim. Trace amounts means less than 1 microgram. They contain 25 micrograms, which is 25 times trace amount and over 100 times what EPA’s safe exposure levels are. … So today, in the last three or four years, that number has been reduced to 48 million.

Which number has been reduced to 48 million?

I believe this year there were 150, around 150 million flu doses manufactured and 48 million of those, or a third, were loaded with mercury.

And when you say this year are you talking about 2016-17? Or are you talking about the coming …

2016. That’s a national health crisis right there. Mercury is 100 times more toxic, neurotoxic, than lead. Why would you inject that into a little baby or pregnant women? It’s insane.

There’s been an Institute of Medicine report …

No, no. No, IOM’s 2004 report did not exonerate mercury. The only thing that IOM did is it looked at a series of epidemiological studies that had been recently created by CDC and based upon, and they only dealt with one issue, which was autism. So all of the other injuries that are known to be caused by thimerosal, including ADD, ADHD, SIDS, speech delays, language delay … none of these have ever been studied.",mainstream,M0a6d1,vaccine.autism
1232,"Autism encompasses a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, communication and repetitive behaviors. Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning the symptoms can be classified in terms of their position on a scale.

Autism Speaks points out there is not just one type of autism but many subtypes influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Each individual has a distinct set of strengths and challenges affecting how they learn, think and problem-solve.

In some cases, people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require significant support, while others can live independently and hold high-functioning positions. Several factors are thought to influence the development of the condition.

It’s widely known that autistic children often suffer from gastrointestinal (GI) problems, with those experiencing the worst GI problems often having the most severe cases of autism. Recent research again highlights the intriguing link between the gut and the brain, and how dysfunction in the gut-brain axis influences ASD traits.

In most children, symptoms of ASD appear by age 2 or 3, although symptoms of associated developmental delays may appear even earlier. In the late 1970s, researchers discovered pairs of identical twins often shared ASD, demonstrating the condition has a genetic component.

However, genetics are by far not the only, or even primary, risk factor. Research from Stanford University School of Medicine, published in 2011, which again looked at twins, discovered fraternal (dizygotic) twins were more likely to share an autism diagnosis than identical (monozygotic) twins.

Fraternal twins share only half their DNA, while identical twins share 99.99%, which means something other than genetics is responsible for the higher rate of double diagnoses among fraternal twins. According to the researchers, environmental factors are the most likely culprit. In conclusion, they stated that “Susceptibility to ASD has moderate genetic heritability and a substantial shared twin environmental component.”

This is not an entirely surprising finding. There is no such thing as a genetic epidemic; hence genetics simply cannot be used as an explanation for the exponential growth in autism cases. Indeed, research published in 2008 found de novo mutations (new mutations that spontaneously arise) associated with autism were present in just 1% of children diagnosed with autism.

Instead, the majority of autism cases appear to result from the activation or expression of a number of different genes, and there are several epigenetic and environmental factors that can trigger them. Among them:
• Toxic exposures, such as the heavy metals aluminum and mercury from contaminated sea food and vaccines, toxic microbes such as viruses and mold, glyphosate and electromagnetic fields from cellphones and Wi-Fi, just to name a few.
• Brain inflammation triggered by encephalitis following vaccination, defective placenta, immature blood-brain barrier, immune response to the mother to infection while pregnant, premature birth and toxins in the environment.
• Gut inflammation triggered by an imbalanced microbiome. Contributing factors include C-section, abnormal microbiome in the mother, bottle-feeding with infant formula and a processed food diet. Russian neurologist Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride believes brain toxicity stemming from gut toxicity, otherwise known as Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS), is a key factor that sets the stage for autism, especially when vaccines are added into the mix. According to Campbell-McBride, toxicity flowing from the child’s gut clogs the brain with toxicity, preventing it from performing its normal function and process sensory information.

As mentioned, recent research confirms and further strengthens the theory that the gut plays an important role in the development of ASD. According to this study, published in the journal Autism Research:

In other words, genetic mutations found in both the gut and the brain may be a primary culprit. Mutation in the neuroligin‐3 R451C has previously been shown to alter synaptic function in the hippocampus and cortex, resulting in impaired social behavior.

Other research has shown neuroligin-3 mutations can also trigger “specialized cognitive abilities” seen in some autistic children. Previous research has also linked the mutation to gut dysfunction. Lead investigator Elisa Hill-Yardin, associate professor at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, told Neuroscience News:

The featured study builds on earlier research, including unpublished clinical work by Swedish, Danish and French researchers. Neuroscience News reports:

Even without a genetic component, the gut microbiome appears to play an important role in ASD. In a 2013 PLOS ONE study, researchers analyzed the microbial content of fecal samples from 20 healthy and 20 autistic children, finding distinct differences between the two groups. As reported by Medical News Today:

The researchers noted the autistic children’s gut microflora had reduced richness and diversity, which are essential factors in creating a bacterial community capable of dealing with environmental assaults. In other words, having an imbalanced gut microbiome may render these children more susceptible to the adverse effects of environmental toxins.

One of the lead authors told Medical News, “We believe that a diverse gut is a healthy gut,” and suggested that antibiotics, which may eliminate beneficial bacteria and have been found to be administered more often in the first three years of life among autistic children compared to nonautistic children, may play a key role.

The GAPS protocol may be the answer for many

Campbell-McBride’s research shows there’s a profound dynamic interaction between your gut, brain and immune system. She has developed what might be one of the most profoundly important treatment strategies for preventing autism.

In her research, Campbell-McBride discovered that nearly all of the mothers of autistic children have abnormal gut flora, which is significant because newborns inherit their gut flora from their mothers at the time of birth. Establishing normal gut flora in the first 20 days or so of life plays a crucial role in the maturation of your baby’s immune system.

Babies who develop abnormal gut flora are left with compromised immune systems, putting them at higher risk for suffering vaccine reactions. If your baby has suboptimal gut flora, vaccines can become the proverbial “last straw” — the trigger that “primes” his/her immune system to develop chronic health problems.

The good news is you can rather inexpensively identify GAPS within the first weeks of your baby’s life, which can help you make better-informed decisions about vaccinations, and about how to proceed to set your child on the path to health.

The entire process for identifying children who would be at risk for developing autism from a vaccine is described in her book “Gut and Psychology Syndrome,” but to sum it up, in her practice she starts out by collecting a complete health history of the parents, and their gut health is assessed.

Then, within the first few days of life, the stool of the child is analyzed to determine the state of the baby’s gut flora, followed by a urine test to check for metabolites. Together, this can give you a picture of the state of your child’s immune system. These tests are available in most laboratories around the world.

If the test results are normal, the risk of autism after vaccination is significantly reduced. If you find that your baby has abnormal microflora, or begins to develop symptoms of autism, the GAPS program should be started immediately, as the younger the child is when you start the treatment, the better the results. The child also should not be given any vaccines until their gut microbiome tests normal.

Identifying abnormal gut flora early on is crucial to protecting your child’s health

Campbell-McBride reversed her own son’s autism using dietary changes and detoxification, and her hypothesis is in my view one of the most relevant. I believe her GAPS nutritional protocol is important for most people these days, as a majority have poor gut health due to poor diet and toxic exposures, but it’s particularly crucial for pregnant women and young children.

The best way to prevent GAPS in the first place is for the mother to avoid all processed foods, sugar, antibiotics and birth control pills before conception as these cause yeast and fungi to grow and also cause leaky gut. This can then be followed by breastfeeding and avoiding the use of antibiotics during (intrapartum) and after delivery.

Another important factor is vitamin D deficiency — especially in conjunction with damaged gut microbiome. Optimizing your vitamin D levels and your gut flora before and during pregnancy may be two of the most important prevention strategies discovered to date.

289,"At 15 months old, Michelle Cedillo was a bright-eyed, cheery toddler who cooed her favorite words like “mommy” and “kitty.” That month Michelle had a routine vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella. She came down with a fever that lasted four days and, according to her parents, resulted in a drastic change. “She did not respond to her name any longer,” says her mother, Theresa Cedillo. “She didn’t look at us. She didn’t talk.”

Michelle was later diagnosed with a severe case of autism—the neurological disorder that affects one in 150 American children—and, 11 years later, her parents are still trying to figure out what went wrong. On June 11 a claim filed by the Cedillo family against the Department of Health & Human Services, which maintains a fund to compensate people injured by vaccines, went to trial in Washington, D.C. The family claims that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative once common in childhood vaccinations (it was phased out starting in 1999 as a precautionary measure but is still used in some flu vaccines), in addition to their daughter’s MMR shot, somehow triggered her autism. Their case before the nation’s so-called vaccine court is the first of 4,800 claims linking autism and childhood shots to be heard by the three judges. The results are being closely watched by thousands of families desperate to understand what scientists have so far been unable to explain: What causes their children’s autism?

The debate has already turned bitter, including at the leading advocacy group, Autism Speaks, where cofounders Bob and Suzanne Wright have clashed with their daughter Katie, who insists vaccinations caused her own son’s autism. “There’s a lot of kids in this country who have literally been poisoned by the recommended vaccine program in the United States,” says Wendy Fournier of the National Autism Association. Nearly all academic and government scientists, though, say there is no link. A 2004 study by the Institute of Medicine’s Immunization Safety Review Committee reached the same conclusion. “We could find no evidence of a biological mechanism by which either thimerosal or MMR could cause autism,” says Dr. Marie McCormick of Harvard’s School of Public Health, who led the study.

While the search for a cause continues (see box), the arguments rage on. The Cedillos’ attorney Kevin Conway, whose firm is handling about 1,200 autism cases, says the mercury in thimerosal from numerous shots, for such diseases as hepatitis B and diphtheria, suppressed Michelle’s immune system at a vulnerable stage of development. Then, according to the family’s claim, Michelle received a measles vaccine in late 1995, which because of the child’s weakened immune system was able to travel through her bloodstream to the brain, where it caused inflammation and brought on autism. The family also blames the measles vaccine for Michelle’s severe gastrointestinal problems. Because of the thimerosal, says Conway, “she was unable to clear the measles virus in that vaccine [from her system].”

Attorneys representing the government are likely to attack the Cedillos’ theory on several fronts. Chemicals, including the small amounts of thimerosal once found in vaccines, are typically flushed from the body within a week, says Peter Hotez, chair of microbiology, immunology and tropical medicine at George Washington University. Dr. Samuel Katz, who helped develop the measles shot, says, “We have no evidence the measles virus persists in the intestines of anyone, even immune-deficient individuals.” (Neither Hotez nor Katz is involved in the Cedillo case.)

A verdict in the trial isn’t expected for up to a year. The Cedillos are optimistic. If they win, they stand to get compensation from the federal fund set up for people hurt by vaccinations. Claimants in non-autism cases have won up to $10 million—an amount that would certainly help. Theresa, 45, a homemaker in Yuma, Ariz., and her husband, Michael, 51, a utility worker, spent about $18,000 last year caring for Michelle, now 12, who can’t walk without assistance or talk but loves watching Teletubbies and listening to music. “I didn’t file this claim with the intent of saying, ‘See, I told you so,'” Theresa says. “I’m hopeful that something good will come out of it.”",mainstream,M0aaa1,vaccine
721,"CNN tried to destroy Donald Trump with vaccine autism question, but he gave this amazing response

It seems like forever ago when 17 Republican presidential candidates were competing for votes and attention, when the seven-person “undercard” and the 10-candidate main events would be held by the cable news channels on the same day, just hours apart.

There were a number of memorable moments, though, and each candidate had his or her moment, for sure. But one candidate emerged from that crowded field, and he just happens to be the most unlikely of all of them: Donald Trump.

The Donald had one of his best moments during a GOP presidential debate hosted by CNN. As NaturalNews editor and founder Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported at the time, the cable channel’s debate moderators attempted to ridicule and destroy Trump with a “gotcha” question about his stance on vaccines and autism.

As Natural News readers are aware, a top CDC scientist has publicly confessed to taking part in the CDC’s fraudulent cover-up of data linking vaccines to autism in African-Americans. But of course the mainstream media – including CNN – and the CDC have gone to great lengths to censor that confession, bury the truth and continue pretending that vaccines have no links to autism whatsoever.

But of all the presidential contenders, Trump is the only one who has publicly expressed intelligent skepticism over the ridiculous and potentially harmful vaccine schedule pushed on American children by a federal regulatory machine that is run by Big Pharma profit motives.

During the Q&A, it was clear that CNN was attempting to discredit Trump over the issue. Trump was asked a question that was tainted with all of the usual pro-vaccine propaganda which claims, falsely, that vaccines carry no risk whatsoever and that as such they could not possibly be linked to higher incidents of autisms.

The question to the eventual GOP frontrunner essentially accused him of being too medically incompetent to make any claims whatsoever about health care, and that he lacked the scientific chops as well. But when CNN posed the question, Trump’s answer was a thing of beauty and quite brilliant.

Saying that he is in favor of vaccines in principle, he also explained, “But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.”

Like a number of informed pediatricians and parents, Trump is very skeptical of the false promises made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the vaccine industry that it promotes.

He even went on to tell a story about vaccines and autism:

Autism has become an epidemic… Because you take a baby in, and I’ve seen it, and I’ve seen it, and I had my children taken care of, over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump – I mean, it looks just like it’s meant for a horse, not for a child, and we’ve had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, two-years-old, two-and-a-half-years-old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. …I’m in favor of vaccines [but] do them over a longer period of time, same amount, but just in little sections. I think you’re going to have – I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.

Following Trump’s answer CNN turned to one of two actual physicians in the crowded Republican field – genius neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson – in an obvious attempt at convincing him to attack Trump for his stance. But while professing his overall faith in vaccines, Carson did say this: “We are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time…”

Suddenly there were two GOP presidential contenders on the same track – that we give too many vaccines too soon and in too large amounts.

Finally, perhaps in desperation, the CNN moderators turned to the other physician on the Republican panel, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., but he too, confirmed what the Trumpster and Carson said:

I’m all for vaccines, but I’m also for freedom. I’m concerned about how they’re bunched up… I ought to have the right to spread out the vaccines a little bit…

435,"The man whose family is at the centre of a measles outbreak in Vancouver said he didn't vaccinate his children because he distrusted the science at the time.

In an exclusive interview with CBC News, Emmanuel Bilodeau said he and his then-wife were influenced by reports that linked the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) with autism.

""We worried 10-12 years ago because there was a lot of debate around the MMR vaccine,"" said Bilodeau. ""Doctors were coming out with research connecting the MMR vaccine with autism. So we were a little concerned.""​​

The MMR vaccine prevents measles, mumps and rubella by helping the body make antibodies to fight off the viruses. The BC Centre for Disease Control (CDC) recommends children receive two doses of the vaccine, one at 12 months of age and the second dose at four to six years of age.

There is no scientific evidence linking the vaccine to autism, says the CDC.

Bilodeau said he knows now the link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been debunked.

""We're not anti-vaccination,"" he said. ""We're just very cautious parents and we just tried to do it in the manner that was the least invasive possible on the child's health.""

""We were hoping we could find a vaccine that was given in a separate shot so it wasn't such a hit on the kid,"" he said.

Bilodeau believes one of his three sons contracted measles during a family trip to Vietnam earlier this year and that it has since spread at the French-language schools his children attend.

Dr. Althea Hayden of Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) said on Friday Vancouver was facing an ""outbreak"" of measles after confirming eight cases affecting students, staff and parents at École Jules-Verne and École Anne-Hébert in South Vancouver and École Rose-des-vents in Oakridge.​

Bilodeau said he brought his sons to a travel clinic on Broadway Street before their trip where they received other vaccinations, but not for measles.

It was on the plane ride home that his 11-year-old son began experiencing symptoms, including fever.

Bilodeau brought him to B.C. Children's Hospital on Jan. 21. He said medical staff were aware that the boy hadn't been vaccinated, but they ruled out measles and instead conducted tests for malaria and influenza.

His other two sons started showing symptoms soon after, but it took several trips to the hospital before it was determined measles was the culprit although Bilodeau says he mentioned the possibility to doctors.

A spokesperson for B.C. Children's Hospital declined to comment on this specific case but provided a statement by email.

""Our physicians and staff thoroughly assess each child that presents in our Emergency Department and treat them accordingly. Should a parent raise a concern about a specific disease, including measles, it would be discussed and then followed up on as appropriate,"" said the statement.

A blood test ordered by VCH has since confirmed his youngest son has measles, and the other two are still waiting for confirmation, Bilodeau said.

Monika Naus, medical director at CDC, said ""vaccine hesitancy"" among parents could lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases.

""We've been concerned about that in British Columbia for a long time,"" said Naus.​​

1306,"(Reuters) - Five years ago, in an office complex with a giant sculpture of a mosquito just northwest of Phnom Penh, Jessica Manning struck on a novel idea. Rather than spend more years in what felt like a futile search for a malaria vaccine, she would take on all mosquito-borne pathogens at once.

Building on the work of colleagues and other scientists, Manning, a clinical researcher for the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, believed she could use pieces of mosquito saliva protein to build a universal vaccine.

The vaccine, if it pans out, would protect against all of the pathogens the insects inject into humans - malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, West Nile, Mayaro viruses and anything else that may emerge.

“We need more innovative tools,” said Manning. A vaccine like this would be “the Holy Grail.”

On Thursday, The Lancet published the initial results of this work with her colleagues: the first-ever clinical trial of a mosquito spit vaccine in humans.

The trial showed that an Anopheles mosquito-based vaccine was safe and that it triggered antibody and cellular responses.

Michael McCracken, a researcher not involved in the study, called the initial results “foundational.”

“This is big, important work,” said McCracken, who studies immune responses to mosquito-borne viruses at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland. “Mosquitoes are arguably the deadliest animal on Earth.”

Malaria alone kills more than 400,000 people each year, according to the World Health Organization. Those deaths occur mostly in poor countries that do not receive as much vaccine research and funding. Because of global warming, however, those mosquitoes that thrive in the tropics are moving into more countries each year.

The global disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought a sharp focus to infectious diseases and vaccine research. One of the key areas of concern are pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes.

The novel coronavirus, believed to have originated in bats, has so far infected more than 7.4 million people and killed nearly 420,000 worldwide. The Asian Development Bank estimates the pandemic could cost the global economy as much as $8.8 trillion.

Manning’s research is specific to mosquitoes, but is an example of how scientists are broadening their thinking about how to tackle infectious diseases, and the new types of tools they are developing.

What Manning is looking for is called a vector-based vaccine. A vector is the living organism - like a mosquito - that transmits a pathogen such as malaria - between humans, or from animals to humans.

All existing vaccines for humans target a pathogen. Manning’s goes after the vector.

The idea is to train the body’s immune system to recognize the saliva proteins and mount a response that would weaken or prevent an infection.

Scientists have known for decades that mosquito spit helps establish mosquito-borne infections and enhance their severity. Just recently, scientists have begun to exploit this.

A study of macaque monkeys published in 2015 showed vaccination with sand fly saliva reduced leishmaniasis lesion size and parasite load. A study of mice published in 2018 showed immunization with Anopheles mosquito spit protected against malaria. Another mouse study published last year showed immunization with Aedes mosquito saliva improved survival against the Zika virus.

The study published in The Lancet was conducted in 2017.

The Phase I trial conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, tested for safety and side effects in 49 healthy volunteers.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two versions of the vaccine or a placebo. After a few weeks, hungry mosquitoes were placed on the arms of study participants. The study measured immune response to the mosquito spit proteins but did not involve pathogens.

More trials are needed to determine the effect the mosquito spit vaccine would have against actual pathogens.

No systemic safety concerns were identified. One participant developed an 8-centimeter (3.15 inches) reddened area around the injection site and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.

“I’m not as worried about redness as I would be about something more systemic like fever, headache, muscle aches, nausea or vomiting,” said Stephen Thomas, an infectious diseases expert at SUNY Upstate Medical University who was not involved with the study.

Thomas has previously worked on dengue vaccine programs for the U.S. Department of Defense and helped manage its response to Ebola and the Zika virus.

Another scientist at the University of Maryland is running a follow-up trial with more mosquito spit proteins and a different vaccine formulation.

Meanwhile, Manning has returned to Cambodia and is running a field study to identify vaccine-candidate spit proteins in Aedes mosquitoes. She also has a separate project sequencing the genomes of all pathogens found in Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, some of which can infect humans.

316,"Equine Internists at the Ohio State University, College of Veterinary Medicine Recommend Vaccination of Horses for West Nile Virus

As most people in Ohio are aware, the first positive West Nile Virus (WNV) bird was detected in July, 2001. This virus was detected in the tissues of a dead blue jay from Lake County, Ohio. That finding establishes that WNV has arrived in Ohio. Since the virus is present in Ohio, and the most at risk populations are crows, blue jays, horses and people, we need to work at preventing this virus from affecting these species.

According to the Ohio WNV Work Group, most of the efforts at preventing WNV infection are directed towards mosquito control. This can be accomplished by eliminating standing water: water may collect in old tires, tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots, or similar containers. Clean roof gutters so they drain properly in the spring and fall, clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas and hot tubs, and if not in use, keep empty and covered. Drain water from pool covers. Change the water in bird baths at least once a week, turn over plastic wading pools, and wheelbarrows, etc. when not in use. Non-toxic products such as mosquito dunks can be used to prevent maturation of the mosquito larvae in standing water that cannot be readily eliminated.

The USDA has recently approved a conditional license for a WNV vaccine for equids, including horses. Dr. Dave Glauer, State Veterinarian, has approved the use of the vaccine in Ohio. The vaccine will be available starting in September of 2001. The vaccine is made with a killed virus and has limited efficacy data, however, a similar vaccine for Japanese Encephalitis virus, which is closely related to WNV, has been used for many years. The efficacy of the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine has been reported at ?80%. Cases of WNV in horses occurred as late as October in 2000 in the eastern US. Therefore, internists at The Ohio State University, College of Veterinary Medicine recommend that if the vaccine is available, horses should be vaccinated twice this fall. The vaccine requires an initial dose and a second dose 3 to 6 weeks later. Horse owners who are interested in vaccinating their horses for WNV should contact their local veterinarian. Veterinarians are being encouraged to place orders so the company will have some indication of the demand for the vaccine.

As part of the safety study of the vaccine, 649 horses and ponies were vaccinated. Systemic or local reactions occurred in very few of the vaccinated horses: 3 horses had localized site reactions (swelling and soreness), 2 horses were reported to have a fever following the initial vaccination only, and 2 horses had other reactions (mild diarrhea within 8 hours of injection in 1 horse and 1 horse was treated for colic within a few hours of the initial vaccination). According to the report filed by Fort Dodge Animal Health, the vaccine did not induce any severe local or systemic adverse reactions in 98.5% of the vaccinations, therefore, the vaccine appears to be safe.

Horse owners planning to export their animals should be aware that vaccinated animals may not meet the import requirements of receiving countries due to the presence of anti-WNV antibodies in blood. While these antibodies are present transiently, presence of the antibody when the horse is due to be exported could result in denial of permission to import.

In horses that do become clinically ill, the virus infects the central nervous system and causes signs of encephalitis. Clinical signs of encephalitis in horses include loss of appetite and depression, in addition to any combination of the following: fever, weakness or paralysis of hind limbs, impaired vision, ataxia (incoordination), head pressing, aimless wandering, convulsions, inability to swallow, circling, hyperexcitability, or coma. Differential diagnoses for neurologic disease in the horse include rabies, botulism, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), cervical vertebral myelopathy (CVM), equine herpes (EHV1), equine degenerative myelopathy (EDM) and other encephalitides such as western equine encephalitis (WEE), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE-reportable in Ohio) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE-reportable in Ohio), should all be considered. Many of the reported cases have similar clinical signs to commonly diagnosed neurologic diseases, particularly EPM. See Ohio State University Web site for aids in differential diagnosis.

Horse owners are encouraged not to become complacent once their horses have been vaccinated. Elimination of mosquito breeding sites and personal protection are still important. Another important role the horse owner may play in our efforts to prevent WNV is to continue to report dead bird sightings to their local health department. The local health department will determine if those dead birds should be transported to the Ohio Department of Agriculture for pathologic examination.",mainstream,M0b3bd,vaccine; vaccine.covid
610,"There are wide opinion gaps between scientists and the public on a number of big issues, from the safety of genetically modified foods to the cause of climate change, a new survey suggests.

""There is a disconnect between the way in which the public perceives the state of science and science's position on a variety of issues,"" said Alan Leshner, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences (AAAS), in a press conference on Wednesday (Jan. 28).

In addition, the general public is more optimistic about the future of science than those working in the trenches of scientific research, the survey finds. But there is some common ground: Scientists and the lay public agree that U.S. schoolchildren receive poorer-quality education in science technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) than do kids in other countries, the study showed. [6 Myths About Girls and Science]

Surveys have consistently found that only about half of the public believes humans evolved from earlier animals. Other studies have found that belief in human-caused climate change divides sharply along political lines.

But there has been less research comparing the views of scientists and the general public on a wide range of other topics.

To see how scientists' views differ from those of the general public, the Pew Research Center, in conjunction with AAAS, called a random sample of 2,002 adults around the country and asked questions about whether humans have evolved over time; whether genetically modified foods are safe; and whether the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine could cause autism. The researchers also contacted a sample of 3,748 U.S.-based scientists who are AAAS members to ask the same questions.

They respondents were also asked questions that touched on policy decisions and how society viewed science and its future.

On most of these issues, there was a big gap between the opinions of the general public and those of scientists. For instance, 88 percent of the scientists said genetically modified foods are safe to eat, compared to just 37 percent of other adults. About 89 percent of scientists said they favored using animals in research, compared to just 42 percent of lay people. And though 68 percent of scientists said it was safe to eat foods grown with pesticides, only 28 percent of the public said the same.

When it came to science relevant to controversial policy decisions, there were large gaps, too. About 87 percent of the scientists said climate change is mostly due to human activities, while just half of the public did. More than 50 percent of the public said they want increased offshore drilling, compared to less than a third of the scientists. And about 65 percent of scientists said they support building more nuclear power plants, compared to just 45 percent of the public.

There were a few areas of agreement, however: Roughly two-thirds of both scientists and the public said the International Space Station was a good investment, and large majorities of both groups said they favor developing bioengineered fuel. [Best Supporting Role: 8 Celebs Who Promote Science]

Overall, however, the public views science positively, the survey showed.

""The majority say the effect of science on the quality of food, health care and the environment has been positive,"" said study co-author Cary Funk, associate director of research at the Pew Research Center.

Scientists were also more likely to say it's a bad time for science, while the public was more optimistic about the state of the field. And both groups said that basic STEM education in the country lagged behind that of other nations.

The reason for the gaps may differ for different issues, Leshner said.

On some issues, such as genetically modified foods, it may be that the public simply doesn't understand what the term really means, which suggests scientists need to do a better job of translating their science for the public, Leshner said in a media briefing Wednesday (Jan. 28).

But there are likely deeper causes behind the divide on other issues.

""In the case of an issue like evolution, the conflict is with people's core values and their core religious beliefs, and unfortunately we have known for decades that ideology and core beliefs trump science frequently,"" said Leshner, who wrote an editorial about the survey results that was published today (Jan. 29) in the journal Science.

But not everyone agrees that an opinion gap is always a huge problem.

It's unlikely to have huge impacts on society if many people do not believe humans evolved from primates or that the world began in a Big Bang, said John Evans, a sociologist at the University of California San Diego, who was not involved in the new survey.

But with issues like climate change, the gap between the public and science can cause more problems, Evans said.

If humans are warming the Earth but the public doesn't believe in climate change, then ""it gives politicians a reason not to do anything about it,"" Evans told Live Science.",mainstream,M0864a,gmo; vaccine.autism
233,"The most effective way of preventing the flu is with an influenza vaccination. Every fall you should be immunized against strains that have developed since the previous outbreak. If you are vaccinated against three or more strains, you may still come down with flu, but symptoms are likely to be milder than they would have been had you not had an influenza vaccination.

Influenza vaccine is available through physicians and public-health facilities and many companies provide flu vaccines on-site for their workers. Because influenza is a serious threat, the CDC recommends vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older and others at high risk of flu complications:
• Those with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and asthma
• People with a weakened immune system, like those with HIV/AIDS

The seasonal flu vaccine is available in three forms. One is the injectable vaccine made from an inactivated virus. This form is usually given as a single injection and is approved for people 6 months of age or older.

Another form is given as a nasal spray called FluMist. This form of the vaccine is a live and weakened form of the flu and is approved for all healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant. If you are pregnant you can only receive the injectable form. The CDC also has recommended the nasal spray vaccine for healthy children 2 years and older without preference over the flu shot.

There is also a “needle-less” option for people 18-64 years old: the jet injector vaccine with Afluria, which uses a tool with high pressure to deliver the vaccine.

All of the vaccines are given as a single dose, although children who are receiving vaccination for the first time receive two. Some people develop low fever and muscle aches as side effects of the vaccine.
• Intradermal shots use smaller needles that only go into the top layer of the skin instead of the muscle. They're available for those ages 18 to 64. If you have severe egg allergies you should get the flu shot from a doctor who can treat a severe allergic reaction -- either at your doctor's office, a hospital, a clinic, or a health department.
• Egg-free vaccines are now available for those aged 18 and older who have severe egg allergies.
• High-dose vaccines are meant for those ages 65 and older, when available, and may better protect this group from the flu.",mainstream,M07cc4,vaccine

291,"New study: Nations requiring the most vaccines tend to have the worst infant mortality rates

A new study, published in Human and Experimental Toxicology (http://het.sagepub.com/content/earl…), a peer-reviewed journal indexed by the National Library of Medicine, found that nations with higher (worse) infant mortality rates tend to give their infants more vaccine doses. For example, the United States requires infants to receive 26 vaccines — the most in the world — yet more than six U.S. infants die per every 1000 live births. In contrast, Sweden and Japan administer 12 vaccines to infants, the least amount, and report less than three deaths per 1000 live births.

The authors of the study, Neil Z. Miller and Dr. Gary Goldman, conducted a literature review to determine the immunization schedules for the United States and all 33 nations with better infant mortality rates than the United States. The total number of vaccine doses specified for infants aged less than one year was then determined for each country. The 34 nations were then organized into data pairs consisting of total number of vaccine doses specified for their infants and infant mortality rates. A scatter plot of the data pairs provided evidence of a positive correlation:infant mortality rates and vaccine doses tend to increase together.

Nations were also grouped into five different vaccine dose ranges. The mean infant mortality rates of all nations within each group were then calculated. Analysis showed“a high statistically significant correlation between increasing number of vaccine doses and increasing infant mortality rates.”

It is instructive to note that many developing nations require their infants to receive multiple vaccine doses and have national vaccine coverage rates (a percentage of the target population that has been vaccinated) of 90% or better, yet their infant mortality rates are poor. Infant mortality rates will remain high in nations that cannot provide clean water, proper nutrition, improved sanitation, and better access to health care.

Nations with higher (worse) infant mortality rates give their infants, on average, more vaccine doses. This positive correlation, derived from the data, elicits an important inquiry: Are some infant deaths associated with over-vaccination? Is it possible that some nations are requiring too many vaccines for their infants and the additional vaccines are a toxic burden on their health?

Stock up with Fresh Food that lasts with eFoodsDirect (AD)

There is some evidence that a subset of infants may be more susceptible to SIDS shortly after being vaccinated. For example, Torch found that unvaccinated babies who died of SIDS did so most often in the fall or winter while vaccinated babies died most often at 2 and 4 months — the same ages when initial doses of DPT were given to infants. He concluded that DPT “may be a generally unrecognized major cause of sudden infant and early childhood death, and that the risks of immunization may outweigh its potential benefits.” It appears as though some infant deaths attributed to SIDS may be vaccine related, perhaps associated with biochemical or synergistic toxicity due to over-vaccination.

All nations have an obligation to determine whether their immunization schedules are achieving their desired goals.

339,"Regardless of pressures placed upon vaccine manufacturers, it is unlikely that influenza vaccines will ever change as they consistently contain toxic ingredients as part of their formulas. It is simply the nature of what a flu vaccine is and consequently something that should never be administered to any living being. If we examine influenza vaccines for the 2011/2012 flu season, we find the exact same level of toxicity in these vaccines as their predecessors.

FOR ALL THE ABOVE VACCINES:

Pediatric Use (may lead to toxicity)

 Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established.

Ineffective evaluation protocols in children above 6 months of age. Use may lead to toxicity.

Ineffective adverse event evaluation for these vaccines in all teens/children under 18 years of age. Use may lead to toxicity.

 Potential harm to fetus not studied or examined.

Nursing Mothers 

 Potential excretion of toxic ingredients in mother’s milk not studied or examined.

81,"Democrats claim compassion for illegal immigrant children ravaged by sexual predators but do NOTHING to protect American children from vaccine predators

The amount of zeal with which liberal Democrats are bellyaching about the alleged plight of illegal immigrant children at America’s southern border would make it seem as though these bleeding hearts are out there on the front lines every day fighting for all children everywhere – though that’s not actually the case.

You see, it’s politically expedient right now, with President Trump in office, for the Leftist Mob to highlight every single mainstream media news item about illegals that makes the Commander-in-Chief look like a monster. First it was children “in cages;” then it was children dying; then it was children trying to escape tear gas; and so on and so forth.

For visual manipulation purposes, these libtards have discovered that spreading images of children crying next to border patrol pickup trucks or lying on the floor behind fencing makes those “resisting” Trump appear noble and virtuous – because only a tyrant would allow such things (even though many of the images being circulated were actually taken while Obama was in office).

Nevertheless, the dumbest segments of the left-leaning population seem to fall for this fake news every single time – and yet they’re nowhere to be found in defending American children from much worse threats, like compulsory vaccination. As we reported back in 2015, for instance, California Senator Richard Pan, a Democrat, single-handedly eliminated exemption provisions in the Golden State allowing parents to opt their children out of compulsory vaccination for personal and philosophical reasons, and the Leftist Mob was quick to storm the streets in protest, right? Wrong.

Even though vaccines harm and injure tens of thousands of American children every single year, almost nobody on the Left has ever said a thing about this mass genocide masquerading as “medicine.” Similarly, the Left is completely silent when it comes to the many American children who have been raped and killed by the precious illegal aliens whom they would seem to make their number-one priority.

Why is this, you’re probably asking? Because the Left has devolved into little more than a herd of mindless, brainwashed sheep. Those who listen to what the likes of MSNBC and CNN have to say about world events have been programmed to believe that enforcing immigration laws is “evil,” but injecting children with deadly chemicals that impair them for life, or in many cases kill them, is perfectly fine.

President Trump is the first president in recent history to actually make protecting American lives a top priority

It’s a pandemic of cognitive dissonance and flat-out willful ignorance on the part of these virtue-signaling phonies, who seem entirely unable to discern good from evil. Keep in mind that President Trump, whom many of these Leftists believe to be “literally Hitler,” is actually the first president in recent history to actually make Americans a priority rather than illegal aliens and other special interest groups.

This was made evident back in December when President Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced plans to implement a “Conscience and Religious Freedom Division” that would eliminate mandatory vaccination nationwide – and this was all done under the directive of President Trump himself.

President Trump is similarly standing his ground in ensuring that an effective border wall is constructed between the United States and Mexico to prevent illicit drugs, human trafficking, and other heinous evils from continuing to move back and forth across the border – again an indication that he cares for Americans and wants to protect them from the plight of globalism.

But the Left is unable to see any of this, unfortunately, and would rather pretend as though the president is sitting there in the Oval Office laughing with his pinky in the air like Dr. Evil as illegal immigrant children are being sniped by Border Patrol. It’s Trump Derangement Syndrome to the max, and it doesn’t appear to be letting up anytime soon.",conspiracy,C012a0,vaccine

The band are currently working on their third studio album and, in a new interview with NME, producer Dave Fridmann (Weezer, The Cribs, Tame Impala) confirmed that the group are keen to capture a sound similar to that on the US band’s most recent studio album.

“Most recently I’ve been working with The Vaccines here and they were like, ‘Yeah, ‘The Woods’, ‘The Woods’!,” said Fridmann, who produced the Sleater-Kinney album.

Earlier this year Vaccines bass player Arni Arnason said that the band were heading to a “a farm or a barn… somewhere in England” to work on their third album.

At the end of 2013, frontman Justin Young claimed the band wouldn’t be releasing their third album any time soon, explaining that they had already started writing the follow-up to 2012’s ‘Come Of Age’, but in a “solitary manner”.

He commented: “We’ve always written in quite a solitary manner so we’ve actually already started writing the next record. I kind of feel by admitting that people are going to expect it sooner than perhaps we’re ready to put it out.”

He added: “We’re not set on releasing it any time soon. When we feel like we’ve made the best record we’re capable of making, which is hopefully sooner rather than later, then we’ll put it out and we’re halfway to doing that really.”

754,"The 2010s are over, and the double-20s are about to begin. One phrase that I'd like to never hear again is ""post-truth era,"" an idea that has gained prominence during the past decade, especially the last few years.

One dominant theme of post-truthery is that every person has a right to his/her own interpretation of the facts, and that these alternative interpretations–or ""alternative facts,” as Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway famously called them–deserve to be taken seriously. They don't.

And yet, like most of the pseudoscience that I've been writing about for years now, we have to continue calling out nonsense for what it is, because some of it is harmful, and even deadly. Politics is a never-ending font of post-truthery (or truthiness, as Stephen Colbert defined it in 2005), but here I'm concerned about science. Today I'll highlight three anti-truth campaigns that have caused great harm over the past decades, in the hope that they will soon fade away.

Among serious scientists, truth is not being questioned. Indeed, the essence of science is the search for objective truth. Sometimes, though, a scientific discovery threatens to undermine the power or profits of an influential industry, and that's when industry resorts to denialism (which is essentially the same thing as post-truthiness).

Perhaps the most well-documented example of organized science denialism dates back to the 1950s, when accumulating evidence made it clear that smoking causes cancer. The tobacco industry didn't want to admit this, even though their own internal research supported it, because it meant that their main product was killing their customers, which in turn was terrible news for their business. In response,

Eventually, after decades of lawsuits and literally millions of smoking-related deaths, the industry was forced to admit the truth and pay out billions of dollars in settlements in the U.S. Nonetheless, many people still smoke, and even as recently as 2016, the largest tobacco company in the U.S., Philip Morris, was still trying to deny the science about cigarettes.

My second example is more recent, and potentially even more harmful to the human species. You might have already guessed it: I'm talking about climate change denialism. For several decades, the evidence has been building that the planet is getting warmer. A series of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned, in increasingly confident terms, that humans were the primary cause of recent warming, mostly due to our use of fossil fuels and the carbon they emit into the atmosphere.

The current IPCC report states unequivocally that humans have already caused 1° C of warming, and that the warming will increase rapidly over the next several decades.

Scientifically, these facts are not in dispute. The world is already experiencing more severe storms, unprecedented floods and droughts, and die-offs due to warming oceans (such as the massive and tragic die-off of coral in Great Barrier Reef).

However, the fossil fuel industry sees global warming as a threat to their profits. Rather than invest in new, cleaner forms of energy, large companies such as Exxon-Mobil and billionaire coal magnates such as the Koch brothers have poured countless millions of dollars into disinformation campaigns to cast doubt on the science of climate change. Prominent among these efforts is The Heartland Institute, a fossil-fuel-funded organization whose main mission is to cast doubt on the science of climate change. (Heartland has also worked to cast doubt on the link between smoking and cancer.)

Climate change denialists learned from the tobacco companies that it was possible to delay government action by decades, simply by casting doubt on the science. Unfortunately, their campaigns have been working. For years, many U.S. politicians denied that the planet was getting warmer. As that argument has become increasingly harder to make with a straight face, they've changed their strategy, and now they might admit that the planet is heating up, but deny that human activities are responsible. They're still wrong.

The goal of this denialism is, simply put, to protect the profits of fossil fuel industries. However, truth doesn't care if you believe it or not. The world is getting hotter. Australia just had its four hottest days in recorded history. The unprecedented heat wave has led to hundreds of fires through much of the country, threatening every major city on the continent. There's no reason to think this won't keep happening.

Climate change denialists are only fooling themselves–after being duped by oil and coal companies.

My third and final example is one that has frustrated me for 15 years now, and it’s one that just won't go away: the anti-vaccination movement. This is one of the most frustrating examples of post-truth wrongheadedness, in part it seems so unnecessary, and because so many children have been harmed as a result.

First, let's be clear about the facts: vaccines are one of the greatest boons to human health in the history of science and medicine. People used to die by the millions from smallpox, polio, and a dozen other infections that are now almost completely preventable by vaccines.

Smallpox was 100% eliminated from the planet in 1980, in one of humankind's greatest public health triumphs. Polio has now been eradicated from nearly all countries, and a campaign that started in 1988 has now reduced polio to just a few countries and fewer than 100 cases worldwide. Both of these successes are due to vaccines.

Many other diseases, including measles, chicken pox, and bacterial meningitis, have been reduced so dramatically by vaccines that physicians in the U.S. and Europe almost never see a case. This graph shows the dramatic effect of the measles vaccine, which was introduced in the U.S. in the early 1960s:

The graph shows the number of reported cases, but actual cases were much higher, likely around 4 million cases per year by one estimate. These are the facts.

So what happened? The modern anti-vax movement, led by a small number of extremely vocal, extremely self-confident individuals, began in 1998 with the publication of a fraudulent study (later retracted when the fraud was uncovered) claiming that vaccines caused autism. The study was led by former physician Andrew Wakefield, who later lost his medical license because of his fraud, which included misleading his co-authors and mistreating patients.

Nonetheless, this study was picked up and amplified by several celebrities with large followings, including former Playboy model and MTV host Jenny McCarthy and political activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the nephew of former US President John Kennedy. RFK Jr.

Anti-vax activism is all over the web today, despite many efforts to quash it. Countless claims of ""my child got sick after his vaccine jab"" are presented as proof that vaccines cause harm, and under post-truthism, we're supposed to take such claims seriously.

These stories can be especially difficult to respond to, because many parents are dealing with children who have genuine health problems–including autism–and the parents often truly believe what they are saying. Thus it won't do to tell them to be quiet and go away: their children really do need medical care. They're simply wrong in believing that vaccines have anything to do with their childrens' problems. Their beliefs are amplified by Facebook groups and websites whose sole purpose is to echo and amplify the mistaken claims of anti-vaxxers.

Even though there was never any good evidence that vaccines cause autism, scientists have conducted dozens of studies involving literally millions of children to answer precisely that question, and the evidence is very, very clear: vaccines do not cause autism, nor do they cause any other systematic neurological or behavioral problems. Vaccines do prevent diseases, though, and unvaccinated children can and will get sick. Recent experience has also given us, tragically, many examples of children who died from entirely preventable infections, because their parents didn't vaccinate them. These tragedies didn't have to happen.

Every era is the age of truth. The idea that we're in a ""post-truth era,"" despite being repeated thousands of times in articles, essays, and op-eds over the past decade, is a commentary on people's ability to fool themselves, not on the state of the world. Truth describes the world as it is, and those who choose to deny it might win a short-term argument, but in the long term, they will always lose.

Finally, on a more positive note, I'm somewhat heartened by efforts to educate college students on how to recognize and counter bogus ideas, such as the University of Washington course, Calling Bullshit, created by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West. (Yes, that really is its title.) As the professors wrote:

If you're interested, they've made the lectures available as free videos on YouTube.

Labelling an era as post-anything has always, to me, suggested a lack of substance, as if the era is defined only by what came before it. The use of ""post-"" also ignores that fact that the next era will need a name too. Should we expect ""post-post-truth"" to come next? And what would that look like? Let's hope that the 2020s will give us a return to simple respect for truth. The future of civilization might very well depend on it.",mainstream,M07761,vaccine.autism
566,"The Facts: In a recent lawsuit, the CDC admitted in federal court that they have no studies, evidence or science proving that vaccines don’t cause autism.

Reflect On: Why did they lie for years about this? Why did they conduct a massive media campaign shaming those that questioned vaccines? Why did they invent the term ‘anti-vaxxer’ to put people who question vaccines in a negative light?

This is truly a bombshell story when you understand the full implications of it, yet major media likely will not touch it. Headlines could read “In stunning lawsuit, CDC admits they have no evidence vaccines don’t cause autism” – but instead, crickets. Independent media organizations like CE are left to have to tell these stories, and at the same time risk more demonetization for telling the truth that the public should know. Of course, we also know that since independent media’s reach has been cut, getting stories like this out is very hard and relies on you, the dear reader, to spread the word.

As of March 2nd, 2020, the CDC has admitted in federal court that they do not have any evidence proving that vaccines given to babies don’t cause autism. For years they claimed that the studies had been done, the evidence was clear, and that there was a consensus: “vaccines don’t cause autism.” Yet, this was a lie.

An organization called the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) was instrumental in bringing forth this admission. As they stated in their own press release:

In summer 2019, ICAN submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the CDC requesting “All studies relied upon by CDC to claim that the DTaP vaccine does not cause autism.” ICAN also submitted this same request for HepB, Hib, PCV13 and IPV, as well as requesting the CDC provide studies to support the cumulative exposure to these vaccines during the first six months of life do not cause autism. Despite months of demands, the CDC failed to produce a single specific study in response to these FOIA requests. ICAN was therefore forced to sue the CDC in federal court, where the CDC finally conceded, in a stipulation signed by a Federal court judge, that that it has no studies to support that any of these vaccines do not cause autism.

In short, the CDC provided a list of studies that were to claim vaccines did not cause autism, only, none of these studies proved that. Part of the list was a recent review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which was paid for by the CDC. This study performed a comprehensive review of studies relating to the DTaP vaccine. It was looking to determine whether or not the vaccine does or does not cause autism. The IOM was unable to identify a single study to support that DTaP does not cause autism. What they did find was a single study that did show an association between DTaP and autism.

So for years, the CDC falsely claimed that “vaccines don’t cause autism.” This was based on no evidence, no studies, no science, just speculation. In turn, those that questioned vaccines were called anti-vaxxers, unscientific and extreme about their views, yet were they wrong to claim that vaccines may cause autism and that they don’t feel they are safe? It doesn’t seem to be the case when you consider that a look at the science and evidence available suggests it’s highly likely that vaccinees do play a role in autism. This, as we know now, has not been debunked nor fully proven.

The detail that hits close to home for us here at CE is that fact-checkers have been handing out false claims about our vaccine content, stating that “vaccines don’t cause autism.” This has led to a reduction in our reach and the near-complete destruction of our business due to demonetization. Yet, where did these fact-checkers get their information from? The CDC. And now we know, the CDC never had the evidence to make the claims they made, and the fact-checkers were in fact wrong or truly misinformed. These false claims from the CDC have also effectively led to creating a culture of blind vaccine acceptance even though there is no evidence they are safe.

This leads to the challenge not many are realizing about fact-checking organizations like Snopes, or the ones that work on Facebook; what they do, is turn to major organizations and the government to get their ‘facts.’ And those facts overrule anything brought forth that challenges those ‘facts.’ So essentially fact-checkers are merely purveyors of facts produced by governments and major corporations. Some also happen to be paid by major corporations.

There is an abundance of science showing that vaccines could be linked to autism, in many different ways. Take aluminum for example, A study published in 2018 discovered high amounts of aluminum in the brain tissue of people with autism:

The fact that aluminum in adjuvant form does not exit the body as aluminum in our own food, for example, is one of multiple ways that scientists have shown how vaccines could be implicated in the aetiology of autism. You can read more about vaccines and aluminum specifically, here.

This is not the first time in history that major health organizations, scientists and doctors claimed that something was safe when it wasn’t. Look at cigarettes, agent orange, and DDT. These were just a few that became common knowledge after many people brought awareness forward about the dangers associated with these products. All the while, the companies who owned them, and their cronies fought to claim these people were unscientific, liars and wrong.

Are we seeing this now with vaccines? It sure seems to be following the same pattern. One thing I always look at is if major organizations cannot answer the simple question, and instead turn to ridicule, name-calling and media campaigns to cast doubt, then you know they are hiding something. In my feeling, the CDC knows full well the dangers of vaccines, and they are buying time to figure out how to keep themselves clean for when the cards fall. Because they will.

240,"The Official Military Personnel Files (OMPF), held at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), are administrative records containing information about the subject's military service history. Many OMPFs contain both personnel and former active duty health records, but the service branches discontinued retiring the health record portion to the NPRC in the 1990s.

In the past, all of the military services retired the individual health record, along with the personnel record, to the NPRC upon a service member's separation from service. The Army and the Air Force retired its health records with the Official Military Personnel File, while the Department of the Navy (including the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) retired these files separately to the NPRC until the 1980s.

Health records cover the outpatient, dental and mental health treatment that former members received while in military service. Health records include induction and separation physical examinations, as well as routine medical care (doctor/dental visits, lab tests, etc.) when the patient was not admitted to a hospital.

In comparison, clinical (hospital inpatient) records were generated when active duty members were actually hospitalized while in the service. Typically, these records are NOT filed with the health records but are generally retired to the NPRC by the facility which created them (see clinical records for more information). Medical records from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are also not included.

In the 1990s, the military services discontinued the practice of filing health records with the personnel record portion at the NPRC. In 1992, the Army began retiring most of its former members' health records to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Over the next six years, the other services followed suit. In 2014, the military services dicontinued the practice of retiring the records to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In order to determine where a medical record is located, please see the chart below:

Veterans who plan to file a claim for medical benefits with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) do not need to request a copy of their military health record from the NPRC. After a claim is filed, the VA will obtain the original health record from the NPRC. In addition, many health records were lent to the Department of Veterans Affairs prior to the 1973 Fire.

Veterans who filed a medical claim should contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in order to determine if their record is already on file. The VA Toll Free # is: 1-800-827-1000 - it will connect the caller to the nearest VA office.",mainstream,M09622,vaccine.covid

The trial demonstrates that a single dose of [the trial vaccine] produces virus-specific antibodies and T cells in 14 days, making it a potential candidate for further investigation,"" co-author Professor Wei Chen from the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology in Beijing said in a statement.

""However ... the ability to trigger these immune responses does not necessarily indicate that the vaccine will protect humans from COVID-19 ... we are still a long way from this vaccine being available to all.""

As President Donald Trump pushes to reopen the country despite warnings from doctors about the consequences of moving too quickly during the coronavirus crisis, he has been lashing out at scientists whose conclusions he dislikes.

Italy has recorded 130 new deaths from the COVID-19 epidemic against 156 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new cases rose marginally to 652 from 642 on Thursday.

The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on February 21 now stands at 32,616, the agency said, the third highest in the world after those of the United States and Britain.

Spain's overnight death toll from the new coronavirus has risen by 56, raising the total to 28,628, the health ministry said.

The number of diagnosed cases rose to 234,824 cases from 233,037 on Thursday, the ministry added.

The daily increase in the death toll and the number of cases is not directly comparable to the previous day due to various regions reporting their recent data with delays.

15:20 GMT - 80 million children at risk of measles, polio as vaccines disrupted: WHO, UNICEF

Some 80 million children worldwide could be at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria, measles and polio due to disruption of routine immunisation during the COVID-19 pandemic, UN agencies and the GAVI vaccine alliance has said.

Data shows that ""provision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries,"" the WHO, UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and GAVI said in a joint statement issued ahead of the Global Vaccine Summit set for June 4.

Travel restrictions, delays in vaccine deliveries, reluctance among some parents to leave their homes amid fear of exposure to coronavirus, and a lack of available health workers were behind what it said may be ""unprecedented"" disruption on a global scale since such expanded programmes began in the 1970s.

The Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which US President Donald Trump says he has been taking, was tied to increased risk of death in a study in 96,000 COVID-19 patients, according to a paper published in the Lancet.

The study found that people treated with hydroxychloroquine, or the closely related drug chloroquine, had higher risk of in-hospital death when compared to those who had not been given the drug.

13:50 GMT - Czechs say epidemic under control, further lockdown easing on Monday

Czech health authorities believe the spread of the new coronavirus is under control despite a tick-up in cases in recent days, as the country prepares to open pubs, hotels and relax mask-wearing rules on Monday.

The Czech Republic took early action in March to close borders, schools and much of the services sector and has also been eager to relax many of the restrictions. Most retail and sports grounds have already reopened and from Monday public events for up to 300 people will be allowed and swimming pools and schools will reopen.

Health Minister Adam Vojtech said an initial easing of restrictions from May 11 had not had an adverse effect. The country has confirmed 8,757 cases of COVID-19 by Friday morning, with 306 deaths.

""There are no negative trends noted, it is still valid that the Czech Republic has managed the situation very well,"" he told reporters.

The UK's death toll from confirmed coronavirus cases has risen by 351 to 36,393, the health ministry said.

A total of 254,195 people had tested positive for the coronavirus as of 0800 GMT on May 22.

The number of new coronavirus cases in Qatar has risen by 1,830, the highest daily increase since the outbreak began, bringing the total confirmed infections in the country since the outbreak began 40,479.

To date, 7,893 people have recovered from the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19 and 19 people have died.

Oxford University and AstraZeneca are recruiting around 10,000 adults and children in Britain for trials of an experimental coronavirus vaccine, a day after receiving US backing worth up to $1.2bn.

Researchers are mainly looking for healthcare staff and other public-facing workers to join the trial as in order to get a clear signal on the vaccine's efficacy, they need a minimum number to catch the coronavirus in their everyday lives.

An initial trial that started on April 23 has already seen more than 1,000 volunteers aged 18-55 receive the injection and Oxford said phases II and III will add people aged 56 and older as well as children of 5 to 12 years.

Mosques will remain closed for prayers on the Eid Al-Fitr festival, Saudi and United Arab Emirates officials said, calling on the population to adhere to safety guidelines to avoid the spread of the novel coronavirus.

10:55 GMT - UK gov't took decision to stop mass testing in March: Advisers

The United Kingdom decided to end mass testing and contact tracing of those with or suspected of having COVID-19 in March because a surge in new cases at that time would have been beyond the system's capacity, government advisers said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been criticised for scaling back testing and tracing in March, only to ramp up the system in recent weeks to try to ease out of a lockdown to tackle the outbreak that has all but shut down the economy.

Johnson's government repeatedly says it has been guided in its fight against the coronavirus by scientific and medical advice, and John Newton, Britain's testing coordinator, said it was ministers who ultimately decided on contact tracing.

Coronavirus is believed to be spreading throughout Yemen, where the health care system ""has in effect collapsed"", the United Nations said, appealing for urgent funding.

Referring to aid agencies, Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told a Geneva briefing: ""We hear from many of them that Yemen is really on the brink right now. The situation is extremely alarming, they are talking about that the health system has in effect collapsed.

""They are talking about having to turn people away because they do not have enough (medical) oxygen, they do not have enough personal protective equipment,"" he said.

Yemen authorities have reported 184 cases including 30 deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO), its latest figures show. ""The actual incidence is almost certainly much higher,"" Laerke said.

10:20 GMT - South Africa scientists say up to 50,000 deaths possible

South Africa could see up to 50,000 coronavirus deaths and as many as three million infections by the end of the year as the southern hemisphere winter leads to a higher rate of infection, scientific models showed.

The country already has the highest number of infections and deaths on the African continent, with more than 18,000 identified cases and 339 deaths, but a national lockdown entering its eighth week had slowed infections.

However, scientists and statisticians hired by the health ministry to model the spread of the disease said the country could see between 35,000 and 50,000 coronavirus deaths by November.

Indonesia registered 634 new cases of coronavirus infection, taking its total to 20,796, according to health ministry official Achmad Yurianto.

Yurianto also announced 48 more COVID-19 deaths, bringing the country's tally to 1,326. More than 5,000 people have so far recovered.

George Soros, the billionaire financier, has cautioned that the European Union's survival was threatened by the new coronavirus unless it could issue perpetual bonds or ""consols"" to help weak members such as Italy.

""If the EU is unable to consider it now, it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts,"" Soros said in a transcript of a question-and-answer session emailed to reporters. ""This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality.""

Soros said the EU would have to maintain its AAA credit rating to issue such debt - and thus have to have tax-raising powers to cover the cost of the bonds - so suggested it could simply authorise the taxes rather than imposing them.

09:15 GMT - Virus, lockdowns and the looming second

One by one, governments worldwide are gradually easing tough restrictions meant to contain the spread of the coronavirus - even as, in some countries, infection numbers continue to rise.

The move highlights the pressing need to cautiously reopen economies and restore livelihoods, but the path towards post-coronavirus normality is arduous and long.

With no known treatment or vaccine available, experts warn that an extensive lifting of controls could spark a second - and perhaps deadlier - wave of a pandemic that has so far sickened more than five million people and caused more than 330,000 related deaths.

09:00 GMT - Malaysia reports 78 new coronavirus cases with one death

The government's Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration proposed the extension in response to developments with the global pandemic and to allow time to prepare for further easing at the start of next month.

Britain has extended its mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the coronavirus pandemic for another three months.

The Treasury said more than 1.8 million mortgage payment holidays had been taken up from a scheme that was launched in March. Homeowners still struggling financially could also have the option of making reduced payments.

""Everyone's circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan; but if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there,"" John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury said in a statement.

06:10 GMT - Bulgaria to allow entry of citizens from EU, Schengen countries

Bulgaria, which has started to ease its lockdown, has scrapped a ban on the entry of visitors from the European Union and Schengen visa zone countries, the health ministry said in a statement.

In mid-March European Union member Bulgaria banned entry to its territory to travellers from many countries in an attempt to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The health ministry said that the lifting of the ban also covers San Marino, Andorra, Monaco and Vatican City. The ministry said that people arriving in Bulgaria would continue to spend 14 days in quarantine.

Hello, this is Umut Uras in Doha taking over from my colleague Zaheena Rasheed.

I will be handing over this blog to my colleagues in Doha shortly. Here are the key developments from this morning:

• New Zealand's opposition switched leaders to counter soaring support for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern over her handling of the coronavirus
• The IMF and Ukraine agreed in principle on a new $5bn aid package

The Bank of Japan is offering 30 trillion yen ($279bn) in additional lending to help small firms struggling with the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus.

The central bank says it will start providing the funding to banks in June. The new measure brings the Bank of Japan's total package of financial assistance to small and medium-sized firms to 75 trillion yen ($700bn).

It comes as data showed that Japan has slipped back into deflation for the first time in more than three years, with prices falling 0.2 percent in April.

Joey Salceda, a Philippine Congressman, has introduced a bill in Parliament aimed at taxing big tech firms such as Facebook, Alphabet's Google and YouTube, Netflix and Spotify, to raise funds to battle the coronavirus.

The bill looks to raise 29 billion pesos ($571m) by imposing a value-added tax on digital services provided in the Philippines, a key growth area for e-commerce transactions as its people are among the world's heaviest users of social media.

""We spent to fight COVID-19 and we need more to continue fighting it and recover,"" Salceda, the bill's principal author, told Reuters News Agency.

05:05 GMT - Thailand reports no new cases, no new deaths

Thailand reported no new coronavirus infections or deaths on Friday, maintaining the total of 3,037 confirmed cases and 56 fatalities since the outbreak started in January.

There are 2,910 patients who have recovered and returned home since the outbreak started, the government's coronavirus taskforce said in an update.

Malaysia has reported 35 new coronavirus cases at an immigration detention centre on the outskirts of the capital, Kuala Lumpur.

Noor Hisham Abdullah, director-general at the Malaysian health ministry, said the positive cases at the Bukit Jalil immigration detention centre include 17 people from Myanmar, 15 from India and one each from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Egypt.

Malaysian authorities have arrested more than 1,800 migrants in at least two raids as part of efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, raising concerns they could instead raise infection risks in overcrowded detention centres.

04:29 GMT - Australia's most populous state to relax curbs on hospitality sector

New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, has said restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus will be eased to allow cafes, restaurants and pubs to have up to 50 seated patrons.

""Losing 221,000 jobs in April was a disaster,"" state premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney, referring to state-wide job losses. ""We don't want to see that continue.""

The measure will take effect on June 1. Nationally, nearly 600,000 people were forced out of work in April by the coronavirus restrictions.

New Zealand's conservative opposition has switched leaders in a last-gasp bid to counter the record support Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is enjoying for containing the coronavirus.

National Party legislators voted to ditch Simon Bridges after opinion polls suggested he was headed for a wipeout at a general election on September 19. His replacement is former agri-business executive Todd Muller.

A 1 News Colmar Brunton poll released on Thursday night put support for Ardern's Labour Party up 18 points at 59 percent, a record for the centre-left grouping.

Ardern's rating as preferred prime minister was 63 percent, up 21 points to the highest figure recorded by any legislator in the survey's 25-year history.

Australia extended its ban on cruise ship visits for three months until September 17.

Australian Border Force said any cruise ship capable of carrying more than 100 passengers is prohibited from operating cruises in the country.

The ban has been in place since March 27, following deadly outbreaks linked to cruise ships.

02:07 GMT - No annual growth target for China, a first in decades

China took the rare move of not setting an annual growth target this year after the coronavirus battered the world's second-largest economy and ravaged global growth.

Instead, given ""great uncertainty"" caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Beijing will ""give priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards"", Premier Li Keqiang told the opening of the National People's Congress.

It is the first time China has not set a gross domestic product (GDP) goal since the government started to publish such targets in 1990.

""It is not easy to have 1,900 people in a small place,"" Dr Juan Rosales told Reuters. ""The work has been hard.""

Australia is seeking an exemption from a requirement that travellers arriving in the United Kingdom quarantine for 14 days to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said in a statement: ""Australia has led the world in the successful containment of COVID-19, which clearly means that travellers coming from Australia would pose a low risk to the rest of the world.""

Birmingham said Australia has no plans to open its borders to non-citizens, while all returning locals will still have to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival.

00:46 GMT - IMF, Ukraine agree in principle on new $5bn aid package

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Ukraine have reached an agreement in principle on a new $5bn aid package to help Kyiv battle the coronavirus crisis.

Ivanna Vladkova Hollar, the official who led the IMF negotiating team, said the deal would offer ""budget support"" to Kyiv while ""consolidating achievements to date, and moving forward on important structural reforms to reduce key vulnerabilities"".

00:08 GMT - Trump orders US flags lowered to half-mast for virus victims

Donald Trump, the president of the United States, says he will order the US flag to be flown at half-mast over the next three days as the death toll from COVID-19 approaches 100,000.

""I will be lowering the flags on all Federal Buildings and National Monuments to half-staff over the next three days in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus,"" he said in a Twitter post.

The move follows a request from Democratic leaders to do so to recognise a ""sad day of reckoning when we reach 100,000 deaths"".

The coronavirus death toll in Brazil surpassed 20,000 after a record number of deaths in a 24-hour period, the health ministry said.

The country is the epicentre of the outbreak in Latin America and its highest one-day toll of 1,188 pushed the overall death tally to 20,047.

Brazil has now recorded more than 310,000 cases, with experts saying a lack of testing means the real figures are probably much higher.

With its curve of infections and deaths rising sharply, the country of 210 million ranks third in the world in terms of total cases, behind the US and Russia.

579,"Another issue is the simple fact that many parrots outlive their owners. Large amazons and macaws, for example, can live to be 100 years old.

In these cases, rescues are often in order. But moving from home to home and owner to owner can be traumatic for the sensitive birds. Some parrots arrive at sanctuaries with plucked-out feathers or behavioural issues.

“They are damaged, hurt beings,” Nash says. “The people who take on that responsibility are doing a good thing, because the need for it is a byproduct of humans wanting to own birds.”

Going to the birds

Nash says her human subjects share some traits, like extraordinary patience and a strong sense of empathy for other creatures.

Rescuing and caring for unwanted birds can seem selfless, but Nash also sees these birds fulfilling psychological needs for their caretakers.

“I think it is a way to have an intimate relationship that you can control,” Nash says. “These birds are totally dependent on their caretakers for all their needs. The caretakers of parrots are probably attracted to the service aspect of it, too, and enjoy the feeling of being needed.”",mainstream,M08224,vaccine.autism
744,"(NaturalNews) Unbelievably, a stress protection vaccine is in the works. A Stanford University medical research group led by Robert Sapolsky has been working on it. Of course, this development is heralded in the mainstream media (MSM) as yet another modern medical miracle.

This latest vaccine nightmare focuses on a few physiological biochemical events within the endocrine system as an attempt to prevent chronic stress from harming the immune system.

But injecting vaccines containing foreign particles, heavy metals, and viruses into our bodies has been proven to harm immunity short and long-term. Even if vaccine contents were safe, the antigens that indicate a vaccination’s assumed success don’t provide real immunization.

This proposed stress cure bypasses what people should do to relieve stress naturally or by directly addressing their emotional and mental state.

But vaccinating the population against stress could serve as a terrific adjunct to fluorides for maintaining a docile, chronically sick society.

Robert Sapolsky spent some time in the African wild circa 1980 amongst a baboon population, whose hierarchal behavior was viciously unpredictable, making life uncertain for the ones dependent on alpha baboons. Sapolsky observed that many of the baboons, dependent on the alpha rascals, appeared thin and unhealthy.

Sapolsky used tranquilizer darts on them to be able to draw blood, and he measured their fight or flight hormone blood levels. Sure enough, they were high. More importantly, blood analyses showed a direct link with other markers of a damaged immune system and bad health.

At the time of Sapolsky’s baboon research, mainstream medicine didn’t consider stress an important factor for bad health. He helped bring more awareness to stress, especially chronic stress, as a factor for all disease. That was a good thing.

But his vaccine solution, mired in the AMA-Big Pharma paradigm, is only a good thing for his and Big Pharma’s bottom line. Sapolsky and his research team focused on a way to circumvent glucosteroid hormones that create stress.

They bio-engineered a herpes virus, ostensibly eliminating its dangers while supposedly preserving the virus’ inherent neuro-protective genes. This is aimed toward artificially meddling with the endocrine system.

This bio-engineered virus combined with all that’s necessary to preserve and boost a vaccine creates a dangerously unpredictable cocktail for injecting directly into the bloodstream.

From around 1985 to now, there has been an explosion of chronic stress in our modern world. The unpredictability of managing to lead a safe and secure life has risen dramatically.

More people are realizing they have to simplify their lives. Arguing and fighting less domestically or on the job is one solution for reducing stress. Robert Sapolsky observed how baboons that walked, not ran, away from fights seemed to be healthier.

Practicing hatha yoga with special attention to the “corpse pose” that wraps up a session works wonders. Peaceful, self discipline applied with meditation offers a long-term solution to coping with the chronic, stressful conditions surrounding us.

Meditation practiced daily has been clinically proven to reduce even cardiac disease probabilities connected to stress. Practicing taichi and chi-gong to reduce stress and improve health has caught on more over the last few decades.

Short term solutions are available with herbal and homeopathic remedies that help relieve stress and depression. Acupuncture can be applied to reduce stress.

Aldous Huxley once argued by mail with George Orwell over their visions of futuristic world government tyranny. Huxley posited a pharmaceutically conditioned population, easily controlled with minimal force, while Orwell saw mind control and force as the controlling factors.

Unfortunately, they were both right.

350,"The U.S. government is working with drug makers to maximize availability of influenza vaccines, worried that a substantial flu season on top of another wave of the novel coronavirus could swamp the health care system this fall, a top U.S. health official said on Thursday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking emergency-use authorization for a test to detect and differentiate flu from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, the agency's director Robert Redfield said in testimony on Thursday at the House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee.

""CDC is working with manufacturers to maximize influenza vaccine availability, and with health care providers to develop contingency plans so that people can be vaccinated in a safe environment,"" Redfield said, adding that ongoing COVID-19 activity may affect when, where and how flu vaccines are given.

U.S. pharmacy chains have been preparing a big push for flu vaccinations when the season kicks off in October, hoping to prevent tens of thousands of serious cases that could coincide with a second wave of coronavirus infections.

The United States has 1,827,425 cases of the novel coronavirus and 106,202 related deaths, Redfield said in the testimony.

""This is the greatest public health challenge we have faced in more than 100 years,"" he said.

Democrats have raised questions about the CDC's influence within the Trump administration. Redfield has been less visible in public than Anthony Fauci and the White House's coronavirus task force co-ordinator Deborah Birx. Briefings on the coronavirus, once daily, have all but ended.

News reports have asserted that CDC guidelines have been de-emphasized as Donald Trump has preferred to decentralize authority to the 50 states.

""Not only aren't you driving the bus, but the president seems to have left you at the curb,"" said the chair of the panel, Connecticut Democrat Rosa DeLauro.

Redfield testified that several states that have moved to resume business activity widely haven't met recommended CDC guidelines.

""It isn't just health versus the economy,"" he said. ""It's health versus health.""

Redfield said he hoped for what he characterized as a ""goldmine"" if the pandemic results in public health infrastructure and computer systems being upgraded across the country to use sophisticated, real-time data.

""I have states that are still collecting data on pen and pencil,"" the CDC director said.

WATCH l The ins and outs of wearing masks:

Some Republicans on the panel criticized CDC for evolving information as the pandemic has progressed, including the virus's fatality rate and what Maryland Rep. Andy Harris called the ""cult of masks."" Harris wondered about shifting advice regarding who should use cloth masks as opposed to surgical masks, which are deemed more effective in preventing the transmission of the virus.

Redfield said that medical masks are being preserved for the first responder community as much as possible due to their needs, not because cloth masks have proven to be more efficacious from a scientific standpoint.

Agency still working closely with WHO

The veteran U.S. health official was also asked about the large crowds of protesters who have amassed in the wake of George Floyd's death on May 25. Redfield said that those who've participated should ""highly consider"" getting tested for COVID-19.

""Those individuals that have partaken in these peaceful protests or have been out protesting, and particularly if they're in metropolitan areas that really haven't controlled the outbreak ... we really want those individuals to highly consider being evaluated and get tested,"" he said.

WATCH l Balancing the urge to speak out with the health risks:

On the international front, Trump over the past several weeks has excoriated the World Health Organization (WHO) response to the virus, accusing it of being too close to China. Trump said last week he will end the U.S. relationship with WHO, though it remains to be seen what transpires in Washington, as it is Congress that appropriates funding for the organization, which also helps co-ordinate global efforts fighting a wide range of infectious diseases.

Redfield said that to date, WHO continues to be a close partner in public health efforts.",mainstream,M0759f,vaccine.covid
220,"Emergency Fed meetings at the White House, the launching of new gold trading market at the Shanghai Gold Exchange, revelations Deutsche Bank admitting it manipulated gold and silver prices, China starting its own global payment system. These may all seem unrelated, but according to macroeconomic researcher Rob Kirby, they are all connected. Kirby explains, “With China and their upstart CIPS, which is the China Interbank Payment System, China appears to be on the verge of merging their interbank payment system with SWIFT. My gut is telling me that this will very much marginalize America as the main processor of global payments. This, in my view, will embody very possibly a global reset in terms which currency is going to be the world’s reserve currency. I have a very sneaking suspicion that when China merges with the SWIFT system, I believe there is a very strong possibility that China will back their currency with gold. I do believe this is why China has aggressively been buying physical gold for the past 10 or 15 years. They have been doing it with a view to dislodging the dollar or greatly diminishing the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. That’s what I think is at play right now. I think U.S. bankers and regulators have caught wind of this and are aware it is coming. I also believe this is the reason for all the secret meetings they have been having. The Federal Reserve Board met in secret behind closed doors (Monday morning), and they gave us some frivolous reason why they were meeting. The Fed Chairman, that Monday afternoon, walked over to the White House and met with, not just the President, but also the Vice President. The notion that the President and Vice President would be in the same room at the same time tells you this is national security related. If you don’t think the preservation of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency isn’t a national security issue, you better think again.”

Could there be a dramatic and overnight reduction in the value of the dollar? Kirby contends, “I think this is coming in very short order now. The trail of bread crumbs is indicating this is what is afoot right now.”

Does that mean dollar devaluation and a bank “holiday” coming soon? Kirby says, “How quickly this happens is open for conjecture, but that is clearly the direction we are heading. We are unmistakably headed in that direction. The only real question is how long these criminal central bankers can MacGyver the system together and keep it together with elastic bands, paperclips and bungie cords. This is going down. This is going to happen. I think it’s going down in the next two or three weeks. . . .We’ve all speculated that this would eventually happen. Now we are here, and the clock is about to strike midnight.”

What have the President and the VP been told by the Fed Chairman in these emergency meetings this week? Kirby says, “My guess is they are probably explaining to them just how deep the pooh is that they are about to be thrown into. It’s deep, and it’s going to be over their heads. . . . Historically, when banks have nothing else they can do, they take us to war.”

If they don’t take us to war? Kirby says, “Everything is on the table. . . . My thinking is there are an awful lot of U.S. dollars out there right now that are going to be coming home to America. . . . The adjustment in global reserve accounts could create a tsunami of dollars coming back to America in a very, very short period of time. That could trigger something approaching a hyperinflationary event or, at least, stagflation and super inflationary pressure. That’s the minimum occurring very, very soon.”

About the recent revelation of Deutsche Bank suppressing the price of physical gold and silver? Kirby points out, “The price rigging ultimately comes back to and will be shown that it really is an operation of the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Federal Reserve. . . . The short interests, or the paper sales of precious metals, have been used on purpose to suppress the growing demand for precious metals, or to make it appear that people are still happy with dollars and don’t prefer precious metals to dollars. . . . Whether the U.S. central bank declares that gold or silver are not money in some hubris filled silliness doesn’t diminish the fact that gold and silver are money, and your U.S. Constitution says gold and silver are money.”

Sixty-two unarmed Palestinian demonstrators were shot dead and nearly three thousand more were injured by gunfire and tear gas versus no Israelis killed or wounded while a leading Knesset parliamentarian has assured the public that the Army has plenty of bullets left to kill all the Gazans if necessary.

The White House, however, has obviously not seen the video footage of the slaughter, and was instead celebrating the opening of the new American Embassy in Jerusalem intended to coincide with the 70th Anniversary of the creation of Israel, which some might also refer to as the 70th anniversary of the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian Christians and Muslims. Donald Trump tweeted that it was a “great day for Israel,” apparently having missed watching the slaying of the Palestinians by split screen as the largely American Jewish celebrants yukked it up with a broadly grinning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A short time later someone named Raj Shah at the White House told reporters at a press briefing that “The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas. Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response” as “a gruesome and unfortunate propaganda attempt.”

And meanwhile over at the United Nations, American Ambassador Nikki Haley vetoed a Russian proposal seeking an investigation into the carnage, explaining that that Hamas, aided of course by Iran, was to blame for the violence. “I ask my colleagues here in the Security Council: who among us would accept this type of activity on your border? No one would. No country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has.” She then walked out when Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Permanent Representative to the United Nations began to speak.

Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was part of the Jerusalem delegation, even as violence was erupting in Gaza forty miles away, also knew whom to blame, saying “As we have seen from the protests of the last month and even today, those provoking violence are part of the problem and not part of the solution.” He was not talking about the 200 Israeli snipers firing into an unarmed crowd of Gazans.

To be sure, some Democratic Congressman have expressed horror over what has been taking place. Barbara Lee, Betty McCollum and Bernie Sanders have all spoken up. Sanders said that “Israel should be condemned.” Congressman Mark Pocan declared that “There are better ways to deal with the tensions in Gaza than bullets.” Pocan and Raúl Grijalva, Pramila Jayapal, Keith Ellison, and Hank Johnson all expressed shock and dismay at “the lethal force used by Israeli troops against mostly unarmed protesters demonstrating at Gaza’s border.” They asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to “show utmost restraint, allow for unfettered medical attention for those who have been wounded, and ease the 12-year blockade on Gaza, which has contributed to grave food insecurity, unemployment and a humanitarian crisis for Gaza’s two million inhabitants.”

Congressmen Johnson and Pocan as well as Dan Kildee of Michigan have recently called for the Israeli government to permit them to enter the Palestinian region to see what is happening on the ground there. The three congressmen visited Israel in 2016 but were blocked from crossing into the Gaza Strip by the Israeli Coordination and Liaison Administration, which operates the borders and entry points, limiting who can enter and leave as well as the flow of such essentials as food supplies. It might astonish some Americans to learn that Israel can stop any U.S. Congressmen from entering Gaza, which Tel Aviv illogically claims is no longer under its control even though it has turned the area into an outdoor prison camp.

One notes particularly the lack of even a single Republican concerned over the completely disproportionate carnage in Gaza. Senator Rand Paul, who one referred to Israeli controlled Gaza as a “concentration camp,” is notable by his absence. Senators Ten Cruise, Lindsey Graham, Dean Heller and Mike Lee (a bit of a surprise that, but he is a Mormon) were all part of the official delegation, which also included a number of GOP House members as well as Florida governor Rick Scott.

Regarding the Democrats, it has long been observed that the party base does not any longer support the philo-Israel policies embraced by the Clintonesque Democratic National Committee leadership. Those congressmen who have spoken out certainly deserve the public’s support when they find Israel’s behavior just too much to take.

It would have been refreshing to see more Congressmen criticizing Israel for what are indisputably war crimes in using live fire against unarmed demonstrators. And they should use the same blunt language they use when criticizing Russia or North Korea or Iran. Unfortunately, even when there have been comments or statements that express some concern, they are inevitably and invariably wrapped in excuses for Israel’s inhumane actions, referring to provocative protests “organized by Hamas,” a claim that is pure Israeli propaganda, and/or blaming “all sides,” which again distributes the fault to make Israel look like a victim as well as the Gazans. It is typical newspeak intended to avoid making Israel and its friends unhappy.

The truth is that what Israel does in its own neighborhood endangers the United States and makes every American who travels through the Middle East a target. I recently returned from a conference in Iran and, as the Gaza tragedy was unfolding, we American participants were all wondering if we would make it home. We considered that Israel, bent on a war with Iran that would drag the U.S. in to do the real fighting, might just choose their moment of apparent strength with the new Embassy and the “successful” slaughter of the Palestinians without so much as a peep out of the White House, as a good time to escalate. How many civilian airliners might get shot down? How many more Palestinians will have to die for the monstrous Benjamin Netanyahu’s blood lust truly to be satisfied?",conspiracy,C00fb5,vaccine
29,"Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications. It's now uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of vaccination. Anyone can get measles if they have not been vaccinated or have not had it before, although it's most common in young children. The infection usually clears in around 7 to 10 days.

The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected.
• cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing and a cough
• sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light
• a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C
• small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks A few days later, a red-brown blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck before spreading outwards to the rest of the body.

At the moment it can be hard to know what to do if your child is unwell. It's important to trust your instincts and get medical help if you need it.

When to see a GP You should contact a GP as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child may have measles. It's best to phone before your visit as your GP surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. You should also see a GP if you have been in close contact with someone who has measles and have not:
• been fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine
• had the infection before You should do this even if you do not have any symptoms.

Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you have had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again. But it can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).

The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can easily catch measles by:
• touching a surface the droplets have settled on and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth (the virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours) People with measles are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about 4 days after the rash first appears.

How measles can be prevented Measles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The first dose is given when your child is around 13 months old, and a second dose is given at 3 years and 4 months. Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they have not been fully vaccinated before. Ask a GP about having the vaccination. If the MMR vaccine is not suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you're at immediate risk of catching measles.

How you can ease the symptoms of measles There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection.
• taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains (aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old)
• closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity
• using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes
• staying off school or work for at least 4 days from when the rash first appears In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.",mainstream,M0a68f,vaccine.covid
895,"And the government trusts the public to act as a responsible co-partner in public health. Rather than announcing an official lockdown that would fully close restaurants and businesses and force citizens to stay home, the Korean government has opted to keep more of its economy open. “We were never on lockdown, and we’re still not on lockdown,” Paul Choi, a consultant who lives in Seoul, told me. “But citizens have taken it upon ourselves to stay inside. We’re very careful to wash our hands and keep our distance. Almost everybody is wearing masks. If you don’t wear masks, you get looks on the street.”-

Before the crisis, Choi said, he would leave his apartment early, ride a crowded subway, elbow his way through a packed gym to the treadmills, and then go to the office. “Today, the subway is much less crowded, because more people work from home,” he said. “When I arrive at my office building, there are temperature cameras in the lobby. There’s a regular diner that I go to for lunch, and the staff there tell me that their work schedules have been reduced to avoid layoffs. Larger social gatherings, at bars and restaurants, have been paused.”

I asked Choi how the country had come together so quickly to stem the spread of the disease. “It’s about civic memory, not Confucius,” he said. “We remember MERS. We remember other epidemics. We know this is a marathon. But we’re in a better place because the entire society has been in this game, fighting together.”

As he spoke, my mind turned to vaccination. A live vaccine uses a weakened version of a virus to teach the immune system how to respond to the real thing. Long after the vaccine is gone, the body remembers its immuno-playbook and stands prepared to fight a stronger pathogen in the future. South Korea’s national immune system was instructed and strengthened by previous crises. Other epidemics came and went, but they left behind guidance that Koreans recalled and executed when they were suddenly confronted with the plague of the century.

South Korea’s world-class response to COVID-19 is not the product of religion, or cultural destiny, but rather the result of diseases bested and crises weathered. Unlike the biological response to a pathogen, public policy is not an automatic response, but a deliberate one. South Korea chose to learn. The United States entered this pandemic discombobulated, blundering, and hamstrung by our lack of readiness. Neither history nor contagion will wait for us to catch up. That is the bad news. The good news is that history will go on. And we still have time to learn from it.",mainstream,M07789,covid.19; vaccine.covid
605,"Oxford University and Imperial College London are both in the race to find a coronavirus vaccine. On 23 April the first European human trials began at a lab in Oxford; around 800 people were recruited to take part. Now, on 16 June, Imperial College is starting a human trial in 300 volunteers. A further 10,000 volunteers are also wanted across England, Wales and Scotland. Jack Sommers was one of the first to have the jab on the Oxford trial three weeks ago. [This piece was originally published on 6 June].

It’s been a month since I first signed up for the coronavirus vaccine trials. I was paid a grand total of £235 for five hospital visits, various needles to be stuck in my arm, and generally to be used as a human guinea pig, all in the hope I could help to develop the much-discussed Covid-19 vaccine.

Nothing has been talked up as our potential saviour more than the Oxford University vaccination trial, one of scores being developed around the world. The vaccine has been repeatedly cited as the best hope of returning us to our pre-Covid lives and the UK government is seriously invested; it pledged a combined £43 million to UK-based laboratories rolling out human testing.

The first phase, which I was part of, took place in England last month. Now they’re expanding it to ask tens of thousands of Brits across the country to take part and put themselves in the same position as me in the coming weeks.

If you do sign up, prepare for the process to be more mundane than you might expect. A vaccine trial combines a lot of admin, like signing up for a bank account but with the light trepidation of having your holiday jabs. You apply via an online questionnaire and will be asked every conceivable question about your health history and your family. Once approved, you’ll be called to the hospital.

The first time I went to St George’s in south London I had been self-isolating in my flat for two months; I live alone and am recently unemployed. I found myself in a waiting room surrounded by other people I presumed were there for the same reason (the only other test subjects I know of are three macaque monkeys). Despite our common bond the awkward GP-surgery atmosphere meant we didn’t talk.

On this first visit you are required to give urine and blood samples, fill out forms and watch a video about how they’re expecting you’ll only get mild side effects. Then you go home to await the green light once everything checks out.

In the meantime be prepared for your friends and family to have endless questions, including many wrongly assuming you will be exposed to coronavirus as part of the trial – you won’t. I have found myself inundated with well wishes (and a few conspiracy theorists online too).

Two days after my first hospital visit I sent a frantic follow-up email asking why I hadn’t yet had the call to return for the injection. The reply basically said: ‘Calm down and wait’. It was at this point I started feeling nervous for the first time.

I was called and returned to the hospital – although I was anxious it was also the closest I had come to a normal workplace in weeks. It was a tantalising reminder of life pre-lockdown (despite the sterile atmosphere). My nostalgia quickly evaporated as a nurse started talking about the vaccines given to the rhesus macaques; I salute the monkey's sacrifices for medical science but the serene ‘guinea pig’ image in my head was now well and truly gone.

I thought back to a few messages I had had from people shielding, including one woman with multiple sclerosis who told me: “You are doing something that could help millions of people”. This made me, a grown man who doesn’t like needles and puts a hand in front of his face during horror films, feel fearless. The injection itself – the only dose you receive – was painless. I was given a thermometer and asked to record my symptoms daily through an online diary.

My biggest side effect seems to have been paranoia. I don’t know whether I was in the 50 per cent given the actual vaccine or 50 per cent given a control, but twice in the first week I went to bed with mild fever symptoms, which I may, in retrospect, have imagined. “Raised temperature and sneezing,” I wrote in the diary’s text box on day three with the solemn resignation you might use to telegraph that the Titanic had struck an iceberg.

Given my temperature that day was a perfectly normal 36.5 degrees, my narrative didn’t always quite match reality.

As the weeks have gone on I’ve not suffered any further symptoms. Instead my preoccupation has become with the success of the trials. I used not to care whether Imperial or Oxford got there first but every piece of good news about “my” vaccine has made me want to cheer and blow an Oxford University vuvuzela out the window. Then when it was reported that the vaccinated monkeys all ended up contracting coronavirus, I was bereft.

Thankfully I will not (intentionally) be made to face the virus in the same way but I want to tell my grandchildren I tested the vaccine that saved humanity, not one of the forgotten scores that didn’t work.

Looking back, I can see I’d incorrectly seen myself as the protagonist who had to have the best story, the most dramatic side effects. Eventually, I came to appreciate there will be many trials and thousands more volunteers on the Oxford trial alone. Next week I’ll be back in hospital for follow-up tests just as the latest volunteers arrive for their first shots.

Failure and learning are central to the scientists eventually succeeding so even if my vaccine doesn’t work, I won’t ever regret having been one of the first to add my name to the list.

The state governors will lead the way in their individual states, but many states that are not hard hit will reopen earlier using precautions already established, and, yes, restaurants will open, too, but they will have less tables because of social distancing required. As new Covid 19 infections decrease, so will the restrictions. Some hard hit states, such as New York, will stay on lock down until mid-May.

There is no doubt that China caused death and economic destruction because of how it handled the Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. The leaders in Communist China covered up the problem with the help of the World Health Organization (WHO). China restricted flights from Wuhan inside of China but allowed flights from Wuhan to go anywhere else in the world. The dire consequences were covered up and lied about, which has caused the entire world to go into an economic tailspin. The world’s view of China has been changed forever, and expect manufacturing to leave China and return to the USA.

Even though President Trump is starting to open America up again for business, the economic damages have already been done, and it’s not over.

432,"Elizabeth Barnett, MD, professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine explains if a second flu shot is helpful in preventing illness

There’s only so much protection you can get from eating the right foods, logging eight hours of sleep, and washing your hands more times than you can count; getting the flu vaccine gives you your best chance at avoiding getting sick. And as long as the flu virus is circulating—which it is—it’s not too late to get your shot.

Yet even if you already had your flu shot back in the fall when experts recommend getting vaccinated, you might find yourself wondering: Should I get a second flu shot? You’re not totally off base with your question—if you got yours several months ago, it’s reasonable to think its effectiveness has worn off.

Assuming you’re older than 8 years old, it turns out you don’t need a second flu shot this flu season. A second dose is recommended only for kids ages 6 months through 8 years who have never been vaccinated before or only had one shot in the past, explains Elizabeth Barnett, MD, professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine.

“Because of the immaturity of [their] immune system, they do not respond well to a single dose of flu vaccine,” she says. “Though a single dose will not result in a good immune response, it primes the immune system to respond to a second dose, which then results in a good immune response.”

Adults and older children, on the other hand, are already primed, thanks to their previous vaccinations. “Currently, there are no recommendations for any other age group to receive more than one flu vaccine in a season,” says Dr. Barnett, who is also a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. Adults who have never had a flu shot until this season also won’t benefit from a second one in the same year.

Kids who do meet the criteria for a second flu shot should get their first dose as soon as it’s available. The second dose should be administered at least four weeks later, according to the CDC.

There is some preliminary evidence that the effectiveness of the flu vaccine may wane over the course of a flu season, Dr. Barnett adds, but “at this time, this information does not represent a rigorous study of the phenomenon,” she says, and the research certainly isn’t strong enough to warrant getting another shot.

Bottom line: Rest assured that you did the best thing you could by already getting one shot—and just keep washing those hands!",mainstream,M0ba24,vaccine
1120,"Since writing this in 2004, I



have come to the conclusion that

It was common knowledge that

the Rothschilds ran both Britain and USSR

and there is no way England would allow Germany

His real mission was to lead Germany

Hitler didn't want a world war, and had no stomach for fighting England, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Louis Kilzer, author of Churchill's Deception (Simon & Schuster, 1994).

Hitler believed the future of Western civilization depended on the cooperation of Germany and her Aryan cousins: England and the United States. His territorial demands were limited to Communist Russia, which he regarded as a proxy for Jewish world ambitions. He was determined to avoid fighting a war on two fronts.

The ""miracle at Dunkirk"" was an extraordinary peace overture to England. We don't normally associate Hitler with such magnanimity.

In May 1940, the British were on the verge of defeat. The English army was trapped at Dunkirk. Rather than take them prisoner, Hitler halted his generals for three days allowing 330,000 men to escape.

""The blood of every single Englishman is too valuable to shed,"" Hitler said. ""Our two people belong together racially and traditionally. That is and always has been my aim, even if our generals can't grasp it."" (Kilzer, p.213)

This is not an attempt to exonerate Hitler. His ideology of Aryan racial supremacy and his enslavement/extermination of ""inferior races"" ( mainly Jews and Slavs) are abhorrent to me. (Do I need to say this?) My own grandparents were murdered by the Nazis. I believe people can take pride in their race or nationality without seeking to dominate others.

Nonetheless, we should understand that our view of Hitler is influenced by propaganda. The Allies were also guilty of atrocities and war crimes. Furthermore, Hitler was created, manipulated and destroyed by the same Illuminist clique that runs the world today.



According to Kilzer's well-documented book, Hitler was trying to convince the English to make peace. In exchange, he was ready to retreat from Western Europe and from much of Poland.

Kilzer describes how British Intelligence (an arm of the Illuminati) took advantage of Hitler's racist ideology to divert his energies against Russia and trap him in a two-front war. They convinced him that a large pro Nazi (anti Communist) ""Peace Party"" was prepared to unseat the ""warmonger"" Churchill.

This party consisted of the Duke of Windsor (the former King Edward VIII) and appeasement-minded elitists known as the ""Cliveden Set."" The Nazis had longstanding social ties with this group and confided in them. Hitler seemed to overlook the fact that Windsor went to stay at the Rothschild castle in Austria after he abdicated.

Rudolph Hess, the Deputy Leader of Nazi Germany, was in contact with the Cliveden group and flew to England May 10, 1941 to negotiate peace. According to Kilzer, Hess had Hitler's blessings.

Coincidentally this was the worst night of the Blitz. Afterwards, there was a long lull in both Nazi and British bombing raids. It appears the Nazis thought they had an understanding with the British and turned their attention to the invasion of Russia the following month (June 22, 1941.)

Hitler didn't understand that the Anglo American elite was (and still is) intimately connected with international (i.e. Rothschild) finance. Anglo American imperialism is, in fact, a front for the families that own the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. These Jewish and non-Jewish families are connected by money, marriage and Lucifer worship (i.e. Freemasonry). Both Roosevelt and Churchill were their flunkies. (All our ""leaders"" are.)

In 1776 Meyer Rothschild financed the Illuminati, a Masonic secret society that in turn spawned the major revolutions of the modern era including the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. The ultimate aim is to establish the banker world dictatorship, which is at an advanced stage today.

In the 1930s their purpose was to incite a two-front war that would leave the great nation states (England, Germany and Russia) prostrate. Like all wars, the purpose was to kill millions of people, traumatize humanity, increase public debt and private profit, and make ""world government"" (the future UN) seem essential for ""peace.""

The 1930's British Policy of Appeasement was probably designed to encourage Hitler's expansionist tendencies and to provoke war. Douglas Reed, the (London) Times Correspondent in Berlin, was first tipped off to something fishy when his newspaper suppressed his warnings of the Hitler menace. (See his Controversy of Zion)

Why would the financial elite also want to destroy Russia, which they created?

The transcript of the 1938 NKVD interrogation of C.G. Rakowsky (a.k.a Chaim Rakeover) provides the answer. Rakowsky was an intimate of Trotsky's and former Soviet ambassador to Paris.

Rothschild's agent Leon Trotsky was supposed to succeed Lenin but got sick at the critical moment. Stalin was able to assume power and divert Russia from Rothschild control.

In order to control Stalin, international finance was forced to build up Hitler and the Nazi party. Rakowsky confirms that Jewish financiers backed the Nazis although Hitler was not aware of this.

""The ambassador Warburg presented himself under a false name and Hitler did not even guess his race... he also lied regarding whose representative he was... Our aim was to provoke a war and Hitler was war...[the Nazis] received...millions of dollars sent to it from Wall Street, and millions of Marks from German financiers through Schacht; [providing] the upkeep of the S.A and the S.S. and also the financing of the elections...""

Unfortunately for the bankers, Hitler also proved intractable. He started to print his own money!

""He took over for himself the privilege of manufacturing money and not only physical moneys, but also financial ones; he took over the untouched machinery of falsification and put it to work for the benefit of the state... Are you capable of imagining what would have come ...if it had infected a number of other states and brought about the creation of a period of autarchy [absolute rule, replacing that of the bankers]. If you can, then imagine its counterrevolutionary functions...""

Hitler had become a bigger threat than Stalin, who had not meddled with money. The British were not going to make peace with Hitler because he had stopped the banker's racket. Furthermore, the Illuminati wanted an extended war, the ruin of Europe and the expansion of the USSR.

The book ""Financial Origins of National Socialism"" (1933) by ""Sydney Warburg"" provides another glimpse of how the Illuminist clique supported Hitler. This 70-page booklet was suppressed for many years but was republished in 1983 as ""Hitler's Secret Backers.""

""Warburg"" describes a July 1929 meeting with ""Carter,"" the President of J.P. Morgan's Guarantee Trust, the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, ""the young Rockefeller"" and ""Glean from Royal Dutch."" These are all Rothschild dominated.

It was determined that Warburg who spoke German should travel to Germany and ask Hitler how much money he needed to overthrow the state. The only stipulation was that Hitler adopts ""an aggressive foreign policy.""

""Warburg"" details five meetings with Hitler between 1929 and 1933. The first took place in a beer cellar and Hitler calculated his needs on the back of a paper plate. About $25 million was transferred. This was extremely important in the depth of the depression because the Nazis provided food and shelter to many of their supporters.

Hitler wasn't told the reason for this support and did not ask. On two occasions, he wondered out loud if ""Warburg"" was himself Jewish but dismissed the idea before ""Warburg"" could reply.

There is no ""Sydney Warburg"" but the internal evidence suggests the author could be James P. Warburg, son of Federal Reserve founder Paul Warburg. General Ludendorff's wife testified at the Nuremburg trials that James P. Warburg was the conduit through which eventually $34 million was transferred from Wall Street to the Nazis.

One wonders why anyone would go to this much trouble to alienate the most powerful people in the world if he weren't sincere. The only people with the power to suppress it are the ones it incriminates, and they have a record of suppressing similar works.

See also Antony Sutton's Discussion of this book.

""Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past."" George Orwell

The winners write history. Our view of Hitler and the Second World War is largely a Jewish view.

Paradoxically Hitler was created and manipulated by the bankers he railed against. He lost the war because he didn't appreciate their larger agenda. He naively failed to recognize that they controlled England and the United States. It's as if he didn't believe his own propaganda.

Blinded by racist zeal, he made a fatal blunder (from his point of view) of not neutralizing England by seizing the Middle Eastern oilfields. He made another fatal error by not promising to liberate the Russian people from oppression. Nazi brutality turned the Slavs into implacable fighters.

But for his demented racist ideology and consequent barbarism, Hitler might have done some good. Many Germans and even some German Jews supported him. Instead, he was another pawn in the Illuminati's diabolical game.

298,"Michigan Democrat governor asks feds for Hydroxychloroquine just days after threatening doctors for prescribing it

Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is now asking the federal government to send her hydroxychloroquine just four days after she threatened to revoke the medical licenses of doctors who prescribed it.

Last week, Whitmer sent a letter warning physicians and pharmacists of punishments for the prescribing of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine despite a major study recommending “COVID-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the world.”

Medical professionals were threatened with “administrative action,” with Whitmer claiming that hydroxychloroquine had not met the benchmark for “proof of efficacy.”

How quickly things change. Four days later, Whitmer is now begging the feds to send her hydroxychloroquine.

“We want to ensure that doctors have the ability to prescribe these medicines,” she said. “We also want to make sure that the people who have prescriptions that predated COVID-19 have access to the medication they need. And so all of the work that we’ve done is trying to strike that balance.”

It’s also worth noting that Fox News host Laura Ingraham was forced to delete a tweet that promoted hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 cure under threat of suspension despite it already having been approved by the FDA.

In its approval letter, the FDA said, “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA, it is reasonable to believe that chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate may be effective in treating COVID-19.”",conspiracy,C009d6,coronavirus; covid.19; vaccine.covid
892,"In the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, Friday marks a small landmark. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, is delivering the last of his daily briefings, which have been watched avidly from Bensonhurst to Buffalo, and well beyond. Back in early April, when the Empire State was recording more than ten thousand new coronavirus cases each day, and nearly eight hundred deaths on some days, the sight of a socially distanced Cuomo going calmly through the latest figures, and explaining the situation regarding masks, gowns, and ventilators, presented a ghastly spectacle, but also a reassuring one. With the country effectively leaderless, there was at least one responsible adult in a position of authority—or so we told ourselves as we hunkered down in our apartments and listened to the ambulances racing by.

During the past couple of months, New York’s case figures have fallen precipitously. On Thursday, the state reported six hundred and eighteen new infections, and just thirty-two deaths. Most of New York is now well into the reopening process, and New York City will take another significant step next week, Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed on Thursday, allowing many offices, retail stores, barbershops, and playgrounds to reopen. From this point on, Cuomo will deliver his COVID-19 briefings as needed, he has indicated.

New York’s comeback is a testimony to the heroic efforts of health professionals, E.M.T. employees, transit workers, delivery-truck drivers, and equally essential workers in supermarkets, warehouses, and other places—many of them poorly paid—who kept the stricken city and state going through its darkest days and nights. Cuomo and de Blasio, after some critical early missteps, also deserve credit for sticking at it, as do ordinary New Yorkers who obeyed the stay-at-home orders and wore masks when they became available.

The key point is that it took a monumental and community-wide effort to limit the official death toll to fewer than twenty-five thousand statewide. (Based on the number of “excess deaths” this year, the actual figure is probably considerably higher.) The experiences of New Jersey and Massachusetts were similar. Now, as case counts rise alarmingly in other parts of the country, there is every reason to suppose that these places will need similarly comprehensive efforts to prevent a disaster from occurring. At the moment, though, particularly in parts of red America, a combination of poor leadership, public exhaustion, and right-wing politics is greatly hampering an effective response.

Take Arizona, Florida, and Texas, three Republican-run states that began reopening their economies in early May. In all three states, the number of confirmed new cases has spiked over the past couple of weeks. On Thursday, Arizona reported 2,519 new infections and Florida reported 3,209, both of which were record highs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Texas reported almost eight thousand new cases, which is by far its biggest two-day count yet. These numbers are still relatively small compared to what was experienced in the Northeast, but the nature of a pandemic is that when it gets going it can spread very rapidly, and there are other worrying signs that this may be starting to happen.

In all three states, the percentage of tests returning positive results has increased, which means the rise isn’t simply an artifact of more testing. In Arizona, the rate of positive tests was five per cent on May 10th, and it’s now 9.1 per cent, according to reporting on Thursday from KTAR, a Phoenix news station. In Florida, the positive rate was below five per cent a month ago, and it’s now 7.4 per cent, according to the coronavirus database that Johns Hopkins University maintains.

The number of hospitalizations has also risen sharply. In Arizona on Wednesday, 3,861 people had been hospitalized for COVID-19, compared to 1,699 a month ago, according to figures from the COVID Tracking Project—a rise of about a hundred and thirty per cent. A former director of the state’s health department has warned that emergency field hospitals may be needed by July 4th. In Texas, state authorities reported on Thursday that there are 2,947 people with COVID-19 in hospitals, which represents a doubling since Memorial Day. In Florida, 12,673 people have been hospitalized, compared with a cumulative total of 8,553 a month ago, according to the COVID Tracking Project.

As yet, the number of deaths hasn’t risen as sharply as hospitalizations. That may well change in the coming weeks. With the virus spreading, bitter disputes have arisen between the states’ Republican governors—Doug Ducey, in Arizona; Ron DeSantis, in Florida; and Greg Abbott, in Texas—and local leaders in the hardest-hit areas, who are calling for mandatory mask-wearing, more health resources, and an expansion of contact tracing. Despite having had months to prepare for a possible surge in infections, all three states have fallen woefully short in all of these areas.

The dispute over the use of masks is particularly tragic, since it is by far the easiest and cheapest way to check rapid spread of the virus. Pressured by conservative activists and demonstrators, who in turn have been inspired by President Trump’s chronic irresponsibility on this matter, Ducey, DeSantis, and Abbott have refused to issue statewide orders mandating wearing masks in public. Finally, in the past couple of days, two of them—Ducey, in Arizona, and Abbott, in Texas—have shifted ground, but the manner in which they moved demonstrated the damaging politics at play.

On Wednesday, Abbott said that, while he was sticking to his refusal to act at the state level, he would support local authorities and businesses that require employees and customers to wear masks. “We want to make sure that individual liberty is not infringed upon by government and, hence, government cannot require individuals to wear a mask,” told a Waco television station. “However, pursuant to my plan, local governments can require stores and businesses to require masks.” The same day, Ducey belatedly acknowledged reality, noting, “There is a trend, and the trend is headed in the wrong direction.” He also dropped his opposition to cities in Arizona, such as Tucson and Flagstaff, mandating the wearing of masks in public, but he again refused to issue a statewide order, saying it wouldn’t work, and adding, “I know some people view this as an issue of personal freedom.”

It has long been a basic principle of democratic governance that where public health comes into conflict with individual freedoms, the latter may have to be constricted, at least temporarily. But with Trump in the White House and elected Republicans terrified of incurring his supporters’ wrath, there is now, in parts of red America, nobody willing to make this argument or to follow through with actual edicts. Local leaders and their constituents are left to fend for themselves. Indeed, DeSantis, in Florida, said this openly on Wednesday, when, after insisting that he wouldn’t suspend any of his reopening measures, he added that residents of the state should “make wise decisions for themselves based upon their own personal risk.”",mainstream,M0b4ba,coronavirus; covid.19; vaccine.covid

Childhood vaccines protect children from a variety of serious or potentially fatal diseases, including diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis) and others. If these diseases seem uncommon — or even unheard of — it's usually because these vaccines are doing their job.

Still, you might wonder about the benefits and risks of childhood vaccines. Here are straight answers to common questions about childhood vaccines.

Is natural immunity better than vaccination?

A natural infection might provide better immunity than vaccination — but there are serious risks. For example, a natural chickenpox (varicella) infection could lead to pneumonia. A natural polio infection could cause permanent paralysis. A natural mumps infection could lead to deafness. A natural Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection could result in permanent brain damage or even death. Vaccination can help prevent these diseases and their potentially serious complications.

Vaccines do not cause autism. Despite much controversy on the topic, researchers haven't found a connection between autism and childhood vaccines. In fact, the original study that ignited the debate years ago has been retracted.

Any vaccine can cause side effects. Usually, these side effects are minor — a low-grade fever, fussiness and soreness at the injection site. Some vaccines cause a temporary headache, fatigue or loss of appetite. Rarely, a child might experience a severe allergic reaction or a neurological side effect, such as a seizure. Although these rare side effects are a concern, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm or death is extremely small. The benefits of getting a vaccine are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children.

Of course, vaccines aren't given to children who have known allergies to specific vaccine components. Likewise, if your child develops a life-threatening reaction to a particular vaccine, further doses of that vaccine won't be given.

Why are vaccines given so early?

The diseases that childhood vaccines are meant to prevent are most likely to occur when a child is very young and the risk of complications is greatest. That makes early vaccination — sometimes beginning shortly after birth — essential. If you postpone vaccines until a child is older, it might be too late.

Is it OK to pick and choose vaccines?

In general, skipping vaccines isn't a good idea. This can leave your child vulnerable to potentially serious diseases that could otherwise be avoided. And consider this: For some children — including those who can't receive certain vaccines for medical reasons (such as cancer therapy) — the only protection from vaccine-preventable diseases is the immunity of the people around them. If immunization rates drop, vaccine-preventable diseases might once again become common threats.

If you have reservations about particular vaccines, discuss your concerns with your child's doctor. If your child falls behind the standard vaccines schedule, ask the doctor about catch-up immunizations.

Mayo Clinic Minute: Why and when children should be vaccinated for video Mayo Clinic Minute: Why and when children should be vaccinated Elizabeth Cozine, M.D.: Vaccination prevents a child from getting an illness. It also prevents them from spreading an illness. Jason Howland: Dr. Elizabeth Cozine, a Mayo Clinic family physician, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a standard immunization schedule for school-age children that begins with ages 4 to 6. Dr. Cozine:…which we think of as kindergarten shots. So that's measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. Jason Howland: She says the next set of routine immunizations is at age 11… Dr. Cozine:…which is tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and the meningococcal immunization. Jason Howland: It's also recommended every child get an annual flu shot. And HPV vaccination, which prevents cancer, can start as early as age 9. Dr. Cozine says it's important to educate families on the importance of childhood vaccinations. She likens it to seat belt safety. Dr. Cozine: Immunizations are no different. If we have opportunities to protect our children against serious illness and potentially even death, even if the risk of that illness or the risk of death from that illness is really quite low, I'm all for it.",mainstream,M0b07f,vaccine; vaccine.covid
714,"It’s been only 70 years since World War II, and the mad scientists from companies like I.G. Farben, BASF, Hoechst, Dow and Bayer, who created the gas chambers and tested dangerous vaccines on innocent Jews, didn’t just go away. In fact, they went to work for U.S. corporations and pharmaceutical companies that run the vaccine industry today. At least a dozen of these cold blooded killers were hired fresh out of prison, just 4 to 7 years after the Nuremberg trials found them guilty of mass murder and enslavement.

In fact, at the close of WWII, the IG Farben building in Frankfort was protected from allied bombings by the highest levels of military command. Why? IG Farben was the FDA/CDC type of “pharmaceutical arm” of Hitler’s 4th Reich, and the Rockefellers had a financial interest in maintaining and controlling this pharmaceutical empire, which would soon be catapulted on U.S. soil. Research reveals that Hitler also invested heavily in Merck and other pharmaceutical companies.

Nazi convicted mass murderers became executives for major U.S. chemical and pharmaceutical companies

Fritz ter Meer, found guilty of slavery and mass murder at Auschwitz, served only seven years in prison and became Chairman of the Board at Bayer in 1956. Still trust U.S. vaccines?

This is the same vaccine industry today which protected and employed Nazi war criminals. The very industry that produced the Nazi gas chambers was purchased by Bayer. So, exactly whom are you trusting with your children’s health and welfare?

Currently, the U.S. Government and the CDC rely solely on the manufacturers of vaccines to report problems, injuries and deaths. This atrocity is like letting murderers be their own judges in court! Where are the checks and balances this country was founded upon? Vaccines have economic and political agendas now, and the FDA does absolutely no testing of their own before making decisions to release vaccines to the masses.

Want more research before you or your child get injected with a new concocted disease for which there is no cure? Listen to stunning admissions by vaccine industry experts, including Dr. Maurice Hilleman (formerly w/Merck), who admitted to the deadly nature of the most trusted vaccines.

Today’s vaccines not only contain live versions of the diseases you DO NOT WANT, but also contain GMOs, hormones from infected cows, pigs, chickens and monkeys, untested virus combinations (like H1N1), aluminum, mercury, emulsifiers, and crossbred bacteria from animals, mosquitoes, and diseased humans:

Measles Live Virus Vaccine: (Attenuvax) Made by Merck. Two injections are given; one at 1 year and another at 4 years old. Contains gelatin, sorbitol, sodium chloride, bovine cow serum, egg protein and human albumin.

Measles and Mumps Live Virus Vaccine: (M-M-Rvax) Made by Merck. Injected into one year old babies. Contains gelatin, sorbitol, sodium chloride, bovine cow serum, and human albumin.

Diptheria, Tetanus and Polio Vaccine: Five injections given between 2 and 6 years of age, plus boosters “recommended” every 10 years. Contains formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol and aluminum phosphate.

DTaP, IPV, HBV and Hib*: (Diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B) Given to infants 2 to 12 months with boosters less than a year later. Contains aluminum hydroxide, formaldehyde, and bovine cow serum.

Gardasil HPV: Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Made by Merck. “Recommended” 3 intramuscular injections; given at birth, 2 and 6 months of age. Re-administered to children as young as 9 years of age for a rare sexually transmitted disease. Contains polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, aluminum, and a “denatured” (fragmented and weakened) form of the virus.
•Bovine cow serum: Extracted from cow skin. When injected causes connective tissue disorders, arthritis and lupus; also shortness of breath, low blood pressure, chest pain and skin reactions.
•Sorbitol: Synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues.
•Gelatin: Derived from the collagen inside animals’ skin and bones. Injecting gelatin poses the risk of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity (mad cow disease).
•Egg protein: Vaccines are prepared in eggs (certainly not organic). May contain growth hormones, antibiotics, and salmonella bacteria.
•Thimerosal: A neurotoxic mercury which causes autism: There are 25 mcg in one average flu vaccine, and the EPA safety limit is 5 micrograms, so children who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple* vaccines receive over 10 times the safety limit of mercury in one day.
•Human albumin: The protein portion of blood frompooled human venous plasma; when injected causes fever, chills, hives, rash, headache, nausea, breathing difficulty, and rapid heart rate. Injecting “pooled blood” can result in a loss of body cell mass and cause immunodeficiency virus infection, or contain SV40, AIDS, cancer or Hepatitis B from drug addicts.
•Formaldehyde: Highly carcinogenic fluid used to embalm corpses. Ranked one of the most hazardous compounds to human health; can cause liver damage, gastrointestinal issues, reproductive deformation, respiratory distress and cancer. Plus, formaldehyde has been known to fail todeactivate the virusthe vaccine is intended to cure, thus enabling a live virus to enter your blood and infect your system.
•Phenoxyethanol: A glycol ether/chemical; highly toxic to the nervous system, kidneys, and liver. The FDA warns “can cause shut down of the central nervous system (CNS), vomiting and contact dermatitis” in cosmetics; imagine when injected into your blood.
•Aluminum phosphate: Greatly increases toxicity of mercury, so caution aboutminimum mercury toleranceis therefore severely underestimated. CDC scientists and all doctors are well aware of this.
•MSG(monosodium glutamate): When injected becomes a neurotoxin, causing CNS disorders and brain damage in children.

If you especially enjoy being lied to, visit vaccinateyourbaby.org, where they tell you formaldehyde is safe because it is “present in the environment and is a byproduct of metabolism, so it is already present in the human body.” They also inform you that aluminum is good for you, because “[a]luminum is also commonly found in food, water, infant formula and even breast milk.” Hey, if it’s in the environment, it must be safe to inject into your veins (so why not use snake venom, bleach, and plutonium?).

11:26 a.m. ET — As the coronavirus appears to infect mostly younger people in at least some states and doctors learn to provide better care for Covid-19 patients, the mortality rate of the disease will likely drop in the weeks ahead, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC. Young and otherwise healthy people are less likely to die of Covid-19, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, young people can still develop severe disease as well as die of the disease and scientists are still researching the long-term health effects of an infection.

AstraZeneca's potential vaccine shows promise in pigs with two shots

7:03 a.m. ET — AstraZeneca's potential coronavirus vaccine showed some promise in a trial of pigs, which found that two doses of the shot produced more antibodies than one dose.

""The researchers saw a marked increase in neutralizing antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection,"" the Pirbright team said in a statement. However, the potential vaccine still must prove it's safe and effective in humans as well.

1112,"Willcocks LC et al. (2007) The effect of sirolimus therapy on vaccine responses in transplant recipients. Am J Transplant 7: 2006–2011

Immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil can reduce the protective antibody response to vaccination in transplant recipients, putting these patients at high risk of infections and complications. Few data are available regarding the effect of sirolimus on vaccination response. Willcocks et al. investigated immune responses to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations in 9 hepatic and 23 renal transplant recipients who had been randomized to either continue on a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI; tacrolimus or ciclosporin; n = 17) or switch to sirolimus (n = 15) at least 3 months after transplantation.

All patients received—from the same batches—an influenza vaccine and, 4 weeks later, a pneumococcal vaccine.

Four weeks after influenza vaccination, mean titers of antibodies against all three influenza antigens tested had increased significantly in both patient groups (P <0.0005) and there were no significant differences in increases between groups. Nevertheless, all sirolimus-treated patients mounted an antibody response against at least one influenza antigen that was deemed to be protective, compared with only 75% of CNI-treated patients (P = 0.038). Eight weeks after pneumococcal vaccination, the mean antibody levels for 6 of the 7 pneumococcus serotypes measured had increased significantly in patients in both groups (P <0.05); no significant differences in pneumococcus antibody levels or changes in antibody levels were observed between groups.

Transplant type, serum creatinine level and number of immunosuppressant agents had no effect on response to either vaccine. Vaccination guidelines for transplant recipients on CNIs are, therefore, likely to also be suitable for those on sirolimus.",mainstream,M0918a,vaccine
708,"The coronavirus vaccine may not grant full immunity after just one dose, according to a new report.

When a vaccine proves effective, there’s a good chance it will entail a two-dose series, USA Today reported. Shots may need to be administered one month apart, with a booster following several years later.

As of June 2, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed 10 vaccine candidates under clinical evaluation, with 123 candidates in preclinical evaluation.

Barry Bloom, immunologist and professor of public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, told USA Today that almost all of the vaccine developers are considering two shots in their regimens.

According to the outlet’s report, the first shot in the series would “prime the immune system” to help the body recognize the virus, followed by a second shot to “strengthen the immune response.”

When vaccine candidates reach human clinical trials, more precise dosing will become clear, Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of immunization education for the Immunization Action Coalition, told the outlet.

After the first dose of a vaccine, the immune system develops antibodies and immune cells in about 14 days, says L.J. Tan, chief strategy officer with the Immunization Action Coalition and co-chair of the National Adult Immunization Summit and National Influenza Vaccine Summit.

Tan estimated any COVID-19 vaccine requiring two doses would likely be administered about a month or two apart.

CORONAVIRUS HAS NOT RESURGED IN OREGON FOLLOWING REOPENINGS, STATE HEALTH OFFICIAL SAYS

In addition, WHO officials said the coronavirus isn’t mutating to become more dangerous during a briefing on Wednesday. Since the SARS-CoV-2 is seemingly stable so far, initial vaccines could act as boosters later on to extend immunity, Bloom told the outlet.

However, scientists aren’t sure how durable people’s immune response will be. For coronaviruses causing the common cold, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said immunity almost always lasts less than a year.

""It may be completely different with this coronavirus, with SARS-CoV-2, it may be that they induce a response that’s quite durable,"" Fauci told the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

A two-dose regimen in treating COVID-19 across the country may demand more extensive coordination and record-keeping to ensure patients receive the full course of vaccination.

Senior Catholic leaders in the United States and Canada, along with other antiabortion groups, are raising ethical objections to promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates that are manufactured using cells derived from human fetuses electively aborted decades ago. They have not sought to block government funding for the vaccines, which include two candidate vaccines that the Trump administration plans to support with an investment of up to $1.7 billion, as well as a third candidate made by a Chinese company in collaboration with Canada’s National Research Council (NRC). But they are urging funders and policymakers to ensure that companies develop other vaccines that do not rely on such human fetal cell lines and, in the United States, asking the government to “incentivize” firms to only make vaccines that don’t rely on fetal cells.

“It is critically important that Americans have access to a vaccine that is produced ethically: no American should be forced to choose between being vaccinated against this potentially deadly virus and violating his or her conscience,” members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and 20 other religious, medical, and political organizations that oppose abortion wrote to Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in April. “Thankfully, other [COVID-19] vaccines … utilize cell lines not connected to unethical procedures and methods.”

“We urge your government to fund the development of vaccines that do not create an ethical dilemma for many Canadians,” wrote Archbishop of Winnipeg Richard Gagnon, president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, and 17 other antiabortion religious, medical, and politic groups and individuals in a 21 May letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “The … manufacture of vaccines using such ethically-tainted human cell lines demonstrates profound disrespect for the dignity of the human person.”

FDA and senior White House officials did not respond to emails requesting comment on the letter to Hahn. In Canada, the health ministry has promised to respond to the letter to Trudeau, says Moira McQueen, executive director of the Canadian Catholic Bioethics Institute and lead signatory on the letter.

Cells derived from elective abortions have been used since the 1960s to manufacture vaccines, including current vaccines against rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis A, and shingles. They have also been used to make approved drugs against diseases including hemophilia, rheumatoid arthritis, and cystic fibrosis. Now, research groups around the world are working to develop more than 130 candidate vaccines against COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization; 10 had entered human trials as of 2 June.

At least five of the candidate COVID-19 vaccines use one of two human fetal cell lines: HEK-293, a kidney cell line widely used in research and industry that comes from a fetus aborted in about 1972; and PER.C6, a proprietary cell line owned by Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, developed from retinal cells from an 18-week-old fetus aborted in 1985. Both cell lines were developed in the lab of molecular biologist Alex van der Eb at Leiden University. Two of the five vaccines have entered human trials (see table, below).

In four of the vaccines, the human fetal cells are used as miniature “factories” to generate vast quantities of adenoviruses, disabled so that they cannot replicate, that are used as vehicles to ferry genes from the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. When the adenoviruses are given as a vaccine, recipients’ cells begin to produce proteins from the coronavirus, hopefully triggering a protective immune response.

The fifth vaccine, which has shown promise in monkeys and is headed for human trials as soon as this summer, is what is known as a protein subunit vaccine. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh use HEK-293 cells to manufacture the coronavirus’ spike protein—a vital part of its structure—which is used to trigger an immune response. The vaccine is delivered through a skin patch with 400 tiny needles.

The fetal cell lines are key to producing both types of vaccine. “HEK-293 [cells] are essential for making protein subunit vaccines,” says Andrea Gambotto, a vaccine scientist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the vaccine’s lead developer. Their human origin is important, he says: “Cultured [nonhuman] animal cells can produce the same proteins, but they would be decorated with different sugar molecules, which—in the case of vaccines—runs the risk of failing to evoke a robust and specific immune response.” (Among the developers of the five vaccines, only Gambotto responded to a request for comment.)

David Prentice, vice president and research director at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, which opposes abortion, notes researchers making adenovirus vaccines have modified HEK-293 cells to be adept at packaging new genes—such as those that direct cells to assemble the coronavirus spike protein—into adenoviruses. But he adds that other technologies are available, including using cells captured from amniocentesis that are engineered to make replication-deficient adenoviruses.

“The use of cells from electively aborted fetuses for vaccine production makes these five COVID-19 vaccine programs unethical, because they exploit the innocent human beings who were aborted,” Prentice and a co-author—molecular biologist James Sherley, a Lozier Institute associate scholar and director of the adult stem cell company Asymmetrex—wrote in a position paper published last month.

But Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the New York University School of Medicine, counters: “There are better ways to win the abortion wars than telling people not to use a vaccine. These are long-over abortions. These cells are decades old, and even major religious leaders like the pope have acknowledged that for the greater good it’s not worth the symbolism to put the community at risk.”

The Vatican’s Pontifical Academy for Life declared in 2005 and reaffirmed in 2017 that in the absence of alternatives, Catholics could, in good conscience, receive vaccines made using historical human fetal cell lines.

A vaccine made by the Chinese company CanSino Biologics was the first COVID-19 vaccine to enter phase II human trials. It was developed using adapted HEK-293 cells that the company licensed from Canada’s NRC, where the cells were developed. (NRC-developed HEK-293 cells have already been used to develop an approved Ebola vaccine.) Last month, NRC announced a collaboration with CanSino Biologics under which it is preparing to run late-stage clinical trials of the vaccine in Canada, and scale up facilities to produce the vaccine in quantity.

The two U.S.-backed vaccines that have drawn criticism from antiabortion groups are on a short list of candidates targeted to get financial and logistical support from the U.S. government under the White House’s Operation Warp Speed, which aims to accelerate the development and approval of at least one COVID-19 vaccine by January 2021, according to a 3 June report in .

One of the Warp Speed candidates, made by Janssen Research & Development, uses PER.C6 cells. The second, from University of Oxford researchers and AstraZeneca, uses HEK-293 cells. Both have received U.S. government commitments of, respectively, $456 million and $1.2 billion, if they meet milestones, through the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA).

Another vaccine that relies on HEK-293, being developed by two companies owned by the billionaire scientist and businessman Patrick Soon-Shiong, made an earlier, Warp Speed long list of 14 promising candidates, according to a press release from one of companies, NantKwest.

Prentice says: “As they are choosing—BARDA and the Warp Speed people— what vaccines to move ahead, they should at least recognize that there is some portion of the population who would like an alternative vaccine they can take in good conscience.”

Caplan disagrees. “If you are going to say the government shouldn’t fund things that a minority of people object to, you will have a very long list of things that won’t get funded by the government, from research on weapons of war to contraceptive research.”

The Trump administration has restricted the use of human fetal tissue from elective abortions in biomedical research. One year ago, it adopted a policy that forbids researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from using fetal tissue from elective abortions in their studies. And it imposed an extra layer of review on non-NIH scientists seeking agency funding to do research using such tissue. But the policy did not stop either group from using decades-old fetal cell lines like HEK-293 and PER.C6.

506,"This is the latest in a POLITICO special report on vaccines: the accomplishments, history, controversy and business challenges.

There’s no easy way to develop a vaccine.

Each experimental candidate has about a six percent chance of making it to market, about half the estimate for traditional drugs. Developing vaccines is getting more complex and costs are going up.

“Vaccine development is facing a crisis,” according to Stanley Plotkin, a scientist pivotal in developing the rubella jab in the 1960s and who now advises Sanofi Pasteur MSD, writing in a New England Journal of Medicine comment.

The culprits are many: more stringent clinical trial and manufacturing rules introduced over the last decade, costly production, the “lowest hanging fruit” already developed and a difficult business model, which some go so far as to call dysfunctional.

Amid these trends, demand is rising. Even at a record pace for industry, several vaccines to protect against the Ebola virus that killed more than 11,000 people last year have been tested, but there is still no licensed product. Demand for vaccines for Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and many more infectious diseases are also needed, according to the public health experts.

And there are spot shortages even in developed countries. For example, a shortage of tuberculosis vaccines in France prompted Sanofi Pasteur MSD to hand out shots initially meant for Poland last month.

So far, a concerted global effort eradicated one disease with vaccination —smallpox in the 1980s — showing what is possible with broad coordination.

A major hurdle the industry faces is meeting the fragmented demand across Europe’s markets, according to Andrea Rappagliosi, president of Vaccines Europe, an industry group. Immunization schedules vary by country, requiring different doses and frequency of jabs.

“This doesn’t ease access to a complex product,” which takes up to two years to develop once an order is placed, said Rappagliosi, who also sits on the executive committee of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture.

Vaccines are made using the disease-causing virus or bacteria, but in a form that is essentially harmless, either by weakening it, killing it, or extracting part of the virus or bacteria. This prompts the immune system to develop antibodies against the disease.

Given the complexity in development and the high risks involved, the rewards need to be sizeable to attract investors.

The industry says it costs between $200 and $900 million to develop a vaccine, with an estimated 70 percent of that dedicated to quality control, according to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations.

But some are skeptical that development costs are the biggest hindrance to better and faster vaccines.

Where the money goes

Just a handful of companies — GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Merck and Sanofi Pasteur MSD — control the majority of the market, which inflates prices, critics say.

“The [research and development] model is broken,” said Kate Elder, vaccines policy adviser at Médecins Sans Frontieres.

“Priorities are chosen based on where the money is … diseases predominantly in the developed world,” she said.

MSF, which buys drugs in bulk for their work in developing countries, says that although the number of diseases against which children are advised to be vaccinated has doubled since 2000, the cost of that vaccine package has multiplied 68-fold.

Companies employ “tiered pricing” dependent upon a country’s relative wealth and need. Low-income countries qualify for vaccines via GAVI, a public-private partnership that strikes voluntary pricing deals with pharma; however middle-income countries do not, meaning access can be worse than in poorer states.

And groups like MSF say it is impossible to tell how much it costs to develop a vaccine because companies are not completely transparent about R&D spending.

GSK says its vaccine prices have increased less than 1 percent in the last six years, according to the company’s Chief Medical Officer for vaccines, Thomas Breuer.

“It’s an oligarchy, yes. But one of the reasons companies like Sanofi Pasteur and GSK can provide vaccines for a reasonable price is because they operate on such a large scale,” he said.

He points out that Glaxo is not only targeting diseases in wealthy countries. It has developed a malaria vaccine at a cost of $350 million (€307 million), with no profit expected.

Other gaps in vaccine development tend to be filled by philanthropic organizations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They focus exclusively on less profitable but devastating diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, most prevalent in developing countries.

One vaccine hailed as a success story by industry is Prevnar 13, which protects against pneumococcal pneumonia caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The product has generated cumulative sales of $25 billion for drug giant Pfizer since it acquired the jab in 2009 through its purchase of Wyeth. Last year was a sales record. Success is thanks to demand not only in the developing world, but also in wealthy countries.

Prevnar is made by isolating compounds on the surface of the bacteria.

But Elder of MSF says Prevnar illustrates what’s wrong with the market model.

“This is one of the world’s best selling vaccines, but only two companies sell it: Pfizer and GSK,” she said, referring to Glaxo, which sells a similar version.

“Pneumococcal pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under five … If you want to improve access, you have to improve competition,” she added.

British biotech Absynth Biologics plans to launch first-in-man trials for a vaccine to prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a major problem in western hospitals, in 2018.

But not without help: More than 60 percent of their revenue comes from a government biotech fund, with the rest from private equity.

“Without Innovate U.K. funding, I don’t think we would be where we are at the moment,” she said.

But that fund now looks under threat after U.K. Chancellor George Osborne announced in autumn his intention to switch from grants to loans.

Philanthropic funding to pay for vaccines also isn’t guaranteed.

“GAVI buys common vaccines, but that’s on a charity basis and there are major constraints in the long term when they start losing funding and donors,” said Elder of MSF.

Europe, for its part, helps by supporting promising research into vaccines through the Innovative Medicines Initiative and Horizon2020.

The European Vaccine Initiative, initially mandated to spur clinical development for a malaria vaccine, now also supports candidates for other diseases of poverty. It helps coordinate projects funded by the European Commission and others.

Companies like Absynth look to industry to develop and commercialize their products, since only big pharma has the means to recover from candidate failures. But this model only serves to feed the consolidation trend.

The industry is pushing for a pan-EU vaccines plan to streamline things at the European level.

The group wants a joint action from countries to develop common immunization schedules, improve testing and availability, create flexibility in the purchasing system, and spur greater confidence in vaccination.

“We understand the Commission is reaching out to member states, and there is a strong willingness to collaborate,” Rappagliosi said.

The Commission said it was down to member countries to discuss and accept any joint action on vaccination and cooperation, “as their commitment as regards financial and human resources would be required.”

If it did go ahead, the plan would fit well with Europe’s strides to jointly buy vaccines. After the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak the EU created the joint procurement of medical countermeasures; last month, Austria was the 23rd country to sign up.

To date no vaccines have been jointly bought, but the first call for tender recently took place — albeit for medical equipment — opening the door for more such approaches, and potentially offering an opportunity for greater vaccines access.",mainstream,M0a280,vaccine

The anthrax attacks that followed those of 9/11 have disappeared from public memory in ways analogous to the pulverization of the Twin Towers and World Trade Center Building 7. For the towers, at least, ghostly afterimages persist, albeit fading like last night’s nightmare. But the anthrax attacks, clearly linked to 9/11 and the Patriot Act, are like lost letters, sent, but long forgotten. Such disappearing acts are a staple of American life these days. Memory has come upon hard times.

With The 2001 Anthrax Deception, Professor Graeme MacQueen, founding Director of the Center for Peace Studies at McMaster University, calls us back to a careful reconsideration of the anthrax attacks. It is an eloquent and pellucid lesson in inductive reasoning and deserves to stand with David Ray Griffin’s brilliant multi-volume dissection of the truth of that tragic September 11th. MacQueen makes a powerful case for the linkage of both events, a tie that binds both to insider elements deep within the U.S. government, perhaps in coordination with foreign elements.

MacQueen’s thesis is as follows: The criminal anthrax attacks were conducted by a group of conspirators deep within the U.S. government who are linked to, or identical with, the 9/11 perpetrators. Their purpose was to redefine the Cold War into the Global War on Terror and in doing so weaken civil liberties in the United States and attack other nations.

Obviously these are explosive charges that demand substantial evidence connected logically in a compelling thesis.

MacQueen, in countering anti-conspiratorial thinkers of the left and right who approach such issues with minds like beds already made up, explains his method thus: “The tools of investigation are no different from those used to test other proposals. We use evidence and reason. In some cases we will be able to make confident assertions and in other cases we shall have to acknowledge that we are speculating, but even in this second case we will do our best to ground our speculation in evidence. Ideology, national loyalty, outrage and ‘common sense’ will not do the job.”

There is no doubt that his thesis, backed up by abundant evidence and some intriguing speculation, is a conspiracy theory, just like the 9/11 Commission Report’s explanation of 9/11 and the Bush administration’s neo-con and media assisted conspiratorial tying of Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda to 9/11 and the anthrax attacks. “We would have to look very hard to find anyone who does not hold a conspiracy theory about 9/11,” he writes. “And for this reason it is silly to denigrate people for holding a conspiracy theory about this event.”

But good theory of any kind necessitates facts to make it credible, and MacQueen provides a plethora of these, while the Bush administration made allegations and promises of evidence that was never delivered. He aptly quotes researcher Elias Davidsson ‘s evidentiary points concerning the 9/11 hijackers:

Not only does MacQueen provide copious documented facts to support his case, but he does it in a systematically logical way that leaves the official story in shambles. If a crime were being prosecuted (as it should, but war was waged instead), MacQueen marshals a case for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.

The anthrax letter attacks began on September 18, 2001 when the first letters were mailed from Princeton, New Jersey. Between October 3 and November 20 twenty-two people were infected with dried anthrax spores and five died. Between October 6 and October 8 especially highly refined and aerosolized anthrax letters were sent to two key Democratic Senators, Thomas Daschle and Patrick Leahy. Before October 3 when the first case, that of Robert Stevens who died two days later, was diagnosed, the FBI claimed that “no one except the perpetrators knew…that the attacks were in progress.”

Yet The New York Times, between September 12 and October 3, made reference to the possibility of biological or chemical terrorist attacks 76 times, 27 references specifically to anthrax. Many of these warnings came from government leaders. Of course the Times was home to Judith Miller, notorious for her deceptions regarding Iraq’s WMD, and whose book Germs: Biological Weapons and America’s Secret War, was about to be published in the first few days in October. In that book Miller et al. assert that Iraq might use a terrorist group to unleash a bioweapon against the United States.

Just coincidentally, throughout the month of October as the anthrax attacks became public, the Bush administration and the mainstream media pushed the claim that Al Qaeda (already accused of 9/11) and Saddam Hussein (slyly implicated by innuendo) were responsible for the anthrax attacks. Once the U.S. started bombing Afghanistan on October 7, alleged Al Qaeda retaliation enhanced the claim. No evidence was presented. The Washington Post, vying with The New York Times for Cassadran bragging rights, had published a September 27 article “Al Qaeda May Have Crude Chemical Capabilities.” This double foreign group suggestion – that Bin Laden’s group, state-sponsored by Iraq, sent the anthrax spores – was promoted vigorously throughout October. The crude anthrax letters written to Tom Brokaw of NBC News and Senator Daschle with their 09-11-01 headings and Muslim extremist language, released to the public on October 23, seemed to clinch the case.

By October 26, once Bush had signed the Patriot Act, that case began falling apart, but not before the two Democratic Senators, Daschle and Leahy, who had resisted ramrodding the bill into law, had received their own lethal anthrax letters as possible reminders.

When R. W. Apple Jr. wrote a New York Times front page article on October 18, “City of Power, City of Fears,” and said, “the government has been caught completely by surprise by the anthrax attacks,” he may not have known about the exercise termed Dark Winter, conducted four months earlier on June 22-23, though one would think he might have known of the plethora of references to anthrax in his own paper in the few weeks before the attacks became known. Maybe he thought the Bush administration didn’t read the New York Times for intelligence.

MacQueen,in a greatly significant piece of sleuthing, however, lets us know about Dark Winter, a biological warfare simulation planned and conducted by Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies/Center for Strategic and International Studies at Andrews Air Force Base with uncanny parallels to the actual anthrax attacks. Some oddities follow. Dark Winter had anonymous letters sent to the mainstream media with threats of anthrax. Dark Winter claimed that the perpetrators are probably state-sponsored international terrorists. Dark Winter claimed that “a prominent Iraqi defector is claiming Iraq arranged the bioweapons attacks on the U.S. through intermediaries.” Dark Winter concludes that the attacks necessitate harsh restrictions on civil liberties, possibly Martial Rule. Dark Winter has a fictional television anchor announce that “still no group claims responsibility for unleashing the smallpox virus, but NCR has learned that Iraq may have provided the technology behind the attack to terrorist groups based in Afghanistan.”

And yes, not to be missed, we learn that Dark Winter’s simulation’s actors included Apple’s New York Times’ colleague Judith Miller, soon to be the New York Times best- selling author of Germs, playing a reporter for the New York Times; James Woolsey, former CIA Director and supporter of The Project for the New America Century (we’ll need a new Pearl Harbor, folks); and Jerome Hauer,a member of the Committee on the Present Danger, and “an important figure in the linking of the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax attacks,” who played the FEMA director.

Once the government’s accusations against Al Qaeda and Iraq fell apart but the Patriot Act had become law, NSA spying commenced, and the war in Afghanistan proceeded apace, the FBI changed its tune and pursued the lone wolf perpetrator theory, first accusing a scientist named Steven Hatfill and then, after he sued and eventually received $5.82 million in compensation, they accused Bruce Ivins, a scientist working on an anthrax vaccine at Fort Derrick in Maryland. MacQueen shows in detail how that claim came apart and resulted in a case without credibility but with Ivins committing suicide. But, he concludes, the Ivins accusation served its purpose of diverting attention from the real reason for the anthrax attacks and its culprits.

Finally, MacQueen details how the anthrax evidence leads to some of the alleged 9/11 hijackers in Florida as they lay down a trail of incriminating “evidence” we were meant to follow, linking crop-dusters/anthrax to 9/11. Mohamed Atta, the alleged 9/11 ringleader, supposedly went into a U.S. Department of Agriculture office seeking a $650,000 loan to buy and enlarge a crop-duster. He made sure the agent knew and could spell his name, and when she balked at the loan, “he asked what would stop him from going around her desk, cutting her throat, and taking the money from the large safe in the office.” He then admired a photo of Washington, D.C., asked to buy it, inquired about security at the World Trade Center, implied he was associated with Al Qaeda, and told her that Bin Laden “ ‘would someday be known as the world’s greatest leader.’ “

MacQueen sardonically comments, “And that is the story of how a terrorist leader, engaged in a top-secret operation, sought a government loan to help him with his plan.”

For one familiar with Lee Harvey Oswald’s (or his double’s) antics to make himself unforgettable on visits to a car dealership and a rifle range before JFK’s assassination, the Atta charade should ring a bell. MacQueen makes a powerful case that the various crop-duster incidents were “disinformation” and that their purpose was to link 9/11 to the anthrax attacks and, notably, to Iraq. He notes that it was also at this time that the fictitious story of Atta meeting with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague was widely circulated to “solidify this connection.” He argues that once the FBI admitted that the anthrax attacks were not a foreign operation but the claim had served its purpose, the crop-duster stories vanished into obscurity. However, he concludes, “Given that the anthrax attacks were a domestic operation, and given that the alleged hijackers were implicated in that operation prior to its occurrence, the conclusion cannot be avoided: the 9/11 attacks were also a domestic operation.”

But as few can forget, on February 5, 2003 at the UN Security Council, the Iraq/anthrax/crop-duster claim arose from its sleep in the infamous, fraudulent presentation by Colin Powell as he slyly tied Iraq back to the anthrax attacks and shilled for war against Iraq. That feat of propaganda was but one of at least 532 occasions when eight top members of the Bush administration made at least 936 false statements on Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction and its links to Al Qaeda, according to a study conducted by The Center for Public Integrity and the Fund for Independence in Journalism and released in 2008.

Anyone concerned about the truth behind 9/11 and the anthrax attacks should read this profoundly important book. It is filled with tight argumentation backed by solid evidence, and even the speculative parts ring true.

In closing I will mention MacQueen’s fascinating penultimate chapter wherein he speculates about the significance of the repeated word “unthinkable” by the media and government officials following George W. Bush’s use of the term “rethink the unthinkable” in a May 1, 2001 speech at the National Defense University. The mainstream media used the word “unthinkable” repetitively throughout October 2001 when referring to the anthrax attacks. And one of the early anthrax threatening letters sent to Tom Brokaw, begins: “The Unthinkabel” (sic) – showing, of course, how Muslim terrorists can’t spell English. “There is a pattern here,” MacQueen writes.

Words matter, and those repeated enough matter more, words such as ground zero, homeland, and unthinkable. “He who wants to persuade should not put his trust in the right argument,” Joseph

Conrad wrote in Lord Jim. “The power of sound has always been greater than the power of sense.”

MacQueen has chosen sense through argument, and rather than dismissing his as unthinkable, thinking people everywhere should engage it.

The 2001 anthrax letter attacks in the United States killed five people and wounded dozens. They were widely blamed on extremist Muslims and their backers and used to support the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.

They were also used to justify and hasten the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, which was being presented to Congress just as the first anthrax victim grew ill.

In October 2001, one of the hypotheses that gained ground was that of the Double Perpetrator, the claim that al-Qaeda was carrying out the attacks with the support of Iraq. Much evidence was put forth to support this Double Perpetrator hypothesis but independent scientists soon discovered that the anthrax spores came from a domestic lab in the US serving the military and intelligence communities, not from al-Qaeda or Iraq.

The FBI then quickly claimed that an individual was responsible for the attacks and began noisily looking for this “lone wolf.” In 2008 the Bureau named Dr. Bruce Ivins of the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Disease as the “anthrax killer.” Although the FBI remains committed to the Ivins hypothesis, the case has been disintegrating for the last three years. Currently, it is justly held in contempt not merely by scientists who worked with Ivins but by many journalists as well as several US senators.

But this raises the question: if Ivins did not commit this crime, who did?

This book presents evidence to support the following points:

 (a) The anthrax attacks were carried out by a group of perpetrators, not by a “lone wolf.” The attacks were, therefore, the result of a conspiracy—by definition a plan by two or more people, made in secret and resulting in an immoral or illegal act.

(b) The group that carried out this crime consisted, in whole or in part, of insiders deep within the US state apparatus.

(c) These insiders were the same people who planned the 9/11 attacks

(d) The anthrax attacks were meant to facilitate a seizure of power by the executive branch of government through intimidation of Congress and US civil society. They were also designed to achieve public acquiescence to and support for the redefinition of US foreign policy, replacing the Cold War with a new and aggressive global conflict framework, the Global War on Terror.",conspiracy,C00b5f,jfk.assassination; vaccine
626,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump is reviving long debunked attempts to link vaccines to autism, meeting with a vocal skeptic to discuss chairing a commission on vaccination safety — a move that alarmed child health experts.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, and told reporters that he had agreed to lead the effort, whatever form it takes.

“President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies and he has questions about it,” Kennedy said, adding that “we ought to be debating the science.”

To pediatricians, there’s nothing left to debate.

“Vaccines have been part of the fabric of our society for decades and are the most significant medical innovation of our time,” Drs. Fernando Stein and Karen Remley of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement Tuesday.

Scientists have ruled out a link between vaccines and autism. But Kennedy, the son of the late U.S. attorney general and senator, has long argued that vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal may cause autism, and has advocated for parents to more easily opt out of childhood vaccinations.

Trump also has voiced vaccine skepticism, on Twitter and during one of the primary debates when he said that autism has gotten “totally out of control.” In that debate he went on to say, “I am totally in favor of vaccines, but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.”

A Trump spokeswoman said late Tuesday that while he “enjoyed” his conversation with Kennedy, he had not yet commissioned a panel.

“The president-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time,” said Hope Hicks.

Those are views unsupported by scientific evidence and dismissed as conspiracy theory by experts who find their revival alarming. Vaccination prevents millions of deaths around the world each year. Once common childhood killers can return if support for immunization wanes: During a 2015 measles outbreak that started at Disneyland, many who fell ill were unvaccinated.

Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no evidence that vaccines in general or those with thimerosal cause autism. That preservative has been removed from routine childhood immunizations; while it remains in some flu vaccines, there are thimerosal-free versions.

“The science has spoken. Thimerosal is a dead issue,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a critic of anti-vaccine groups. “It is concerning. You have as a president-elect a science denialist.”

Beyond thimerosal, research has discredited concerns that children get too many vaccines at once.

“Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease,” said Stein and Remley of the pediatricians’ group. It’s not just children who gain, they noted: Widespread vaccination lowers the spread of disease that also threatens the elderly or people with weak immune systems.

lt’s not clear what Kennedy described as a “commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity” would do.

Already, there is a National Vaccine Advisory Committee that advises the government on vaccine safety and other issues, in addition to regulation and oversight by scientists at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Aides to President Trump have touted vaccine prospects, but they’ve also tried to de-couple significant progress toward an immunization protocol from the need to return to workplaces, schools and public life, as many states are now moving to do.

“Everything does not depend on a vaccine,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” echoing language used two days earlier by Trump when he announced an ambitious public-private initiative to achieve widespread inoculation by January.

“Vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back,” Trump said Friday.

With the U.S. death toll approaching 90,000, public health experts described the president’s vaccine timetable as ambitious — perhaps overly so.

“Everything would have to break in the right way, and there are many ways that it might not work,” said Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“So I don’t think we should bank on it,” he said, calling a vaccine this year “far from a sure thing.”

Similar caution was voiced by Tom Frieden, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Interviewed on “Fox News Sunday,” he said a vaccine was “the single most important weapon we could develop against this virus,” but “we don’t have one yet.”

“We hope we will,” Frieden said. “We hope it will be soon, but we cannot count on it.”

Even if a vaccine is developed, logistical challenges to mass inoculation would be daunting, said former Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb.

“A lot of things can go wrong,” Gottlieb said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.“ “A lot of things can be delayed. It’s very hard to get to the point where you’re manufacturing at high, high quantities.”

The U.S. has the world’s highest known tally of coronavirus infections, with more than 1.5 million confirmed cases. But Azar said an overall plateau in cases and deaths was ample grounds for moving ahead with restarting the economy.

“We are in a position to be able to reopen now,” Azar said on CNN. He also played down any alarm over televised images of packed bars and restaurants in states that have eased shutdowns, casting those who fail to follow physical-distancing guidelines as a minority.

“In any individual instance, you’re going to see people doing things that are irresponsible,” he said. “That’s part of the freedom that we have here in America.”

Other Trump allies used similarly benign language to describe crowding in public places and newly reopened establishments.

“Well, I certainly see a small subset of Wisconsinites celebrating a little freedom,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), interviewed on CNN. But he said most people were “being very responsible” in terms of mask-wearing and physical distancing.

Azar also said that predicted spikes of infection had not materialized in states such as Georgia and Florida, which moved quickly to reopen, although he acknowledged that it was “still early days.” An upsurge in illness probably would take a couple of weeks to detect since many people don’t develop symptoms right away.

Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican who has sometimes challenged Trump’s push for a speedy end to shutdowns, said he hoped to avoid a resurgence in his state as restrictions are eased.

“We certainly hope we don’t see that,” he said on CNN, noting that “so much is in every individual’s control.”

Experts such as Inglesby said an easing in the growth of the U.S. caseload should be seen as proof that shutdowns worked, rather than a signal that they should not have been imposed in the first place.

“I think lockdowns were necessary,” he said. “They actually have changed the course of the epidemic in the United States.”

He said with the curve moving in the right direction, it was “now appropriate for states to be thinking about how to very carefully reopen, and do it as safely as possible.”

Frieden, the former CDC head, predicted a long and uneven course for outbreaks in individual states, warning that too-rapid lifting of restrictions could bring painful new setbacks.

“We’re likely to see multiple waves in different parts of the country,” he said. “If we go too fast, it will backfire.”

Trump spent the weekend at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, holding strategy sessions on subjects including the vaccine push.

“We did a lot of terrific meetings,” he told reporters upon returning to the White House on Sunday. “Tremendous progress is being made on many fronts, including coming up with a cure for this horrible plague that has beset our country.”

At the same time, a senior aide unleashed an angry new tirade at Richard Bright, a vaccine expert turned whistleblower who told Congress last week that the administration ignored early warnings about the perils of the virus.

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” said Bright, who was ousted from his post as the head of a federal medical research agency and refused reassignment to a lesser post, had “deserted” the administration at a moment of “tragedy.”

“We could have used him on the battlefield,” said Navarro, who refused an invitation to testify before the same congressional subcommittee as Bright did.",mainstream,M080dd,vaccine.covid

Public officials and health experts had given several warnings: Do not allow a student in school if they had not been vaccinated against measles.



Still, during New York City’s largest measles outbreak in a decade, a school in Brooklyn ignored that advice, resulting in one student infecting at least 21 other people with the virus.

The outbreak, at Yeshiva Kehilath Yakov in Williamsburg, is reigniting concerns that too many people in New York’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities are unvaccinated, as well as worries that measles would continue to spread after travelers arrived last fall from parts of Israel and Europe, where the virus was spreading.

City officials said they have struggled to increase vaccination rates in certain communities because of popularity of the widely debunked anti-vaccination movement, with parents declining vaccines for their children in fear that they increase the risk of autism.",mainstream,M0a191,vaccine.autism
1318,"Does my daughter have autism?

Q: My daughter is two years old. We got her checked for autism as she does not respond to her name and neither does she speak any word. Both of us are working due to which we are not able to interact with her at all; hardly 5-10 minutes in the day. She stays with her grandparents who take care of her needs like food, bath etc. but they do not interact with her either. She keeps watching TV all the time. She has started doing things like drinking water from tumbler etc. only after learning it from TV. She does not respond to her name. Till now none of us call her by any particular name. We use different names or no name at all. She plays on her own, takes care of herself like walking carefully on slippery floor or catching hold of railing while on steps. But she does not walk on slopes and if she does, she takes calculated steps. She does not have any eye contact with us. Though it has improved in last few days but is still minimal. She does not stick to one toy for long and soon gets bored of it. She does not speak any meaningful words like mama or papa. She does not interact with any children of her own age group and we don't know if she will do so in future. She seems to like older children (7-8 years old) and tries to interact with them when she goes to the park - but walks off on her own if there is no immediate response from them. She does not try to interact or play with them. We showed her to a child specialist in Mumbai who advised a hearing test and a psychological test. Her hearing was normal but the psychological tests say that she has few autistic features. Hence her reaction may be explained by lack of interaction and proper stimuli. Do we need to go for another evaluation for autism? If she indeed is autistic, then how to deal with this? Is autism curable and will she be able to live a normal life when she grows up? Will she be dependent on someone in future?

A:The fact that your daughter has shown improvement with only a little stimulation from the parents is very hopeful. Please ensure that you talk to her, looking at her and playing with her, when she is in the mood for it. It does seem a pity that she has spent two years without much interaction with parents or grandparents. Having TV on all the time will just be noise, from the child's point of view. Cut down her TV watching and give her things like stuffed toys, building blocks and even spoons and cups to play with and manipulate. Perhaps all four of you should agree on calling her by one name, giving her a chance to develop an identity and a name. At this age, most children will move from one activity to another. A short attention span by itself is not a cause for worry. It is good to hear that your daughter tries to make contact with older children. Take her out to the park and to friends' homes, where she can meet other children. Help her along if she is shy, but do not force her in any way. Be inventive in capturing her interest. I think that story telling and reading from picture books will be good activities for the daily routine. Singing for her and with her will make the home more lively for the little girl. Both parents need to increase the time spent with her. Your expressions of affection (like hugging her and holding her) will give her a feeling of security. I think that cheerful and active interactions with the child will bring her close to the levels of speech and participation of other two year old children. Just to be sure that she has no special problem. You should consult a specialist in Autism, if you continue to have the feeling that your child is not responsive.",mainstream,M0835f,vaccine.autism
377,"Fact check: Melinda Gates didn't exactly say Black people 'must' be vaccinated for COVID-19

The claim: Melinda Gates says Black people must be vaccinated first for COVID-19 after health care workers.

Melinda Gates, philanthropist and co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, says that after health care workers, Black people must be next in line for vaccination for COVID-19, according to a story on Live24.

Gates, in a Time magazine interview on the eve of global vaccine summit in early June, discussed how anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd, an African American man, while in custody of Minneapolis police fits into health equity, especially with development of a COVID-19 vaccine.

""The first people that need this vaccine are the 60 million health care workers around the world. They deserve to get it before anybody else. Then you start tiering,"" 24Live quoted Gates as saying in the Time story, written by Jamie Ducharme.

That quote matched the one in Time (though Live24 incorrectly identified the magazine as a newspaper). But then, instead of continuing the direct quote, the Live24 piece paraphrased Gates' subsequent statement, writing, ""Melinda went on to say that Black people in the U.S. must be vaccinated after more than 60 million health care workers around the world.""

The same headline was repeated by Health Nut News, but attributed to Time.

The Time interview did not quote Gates as saying Black people ""must be"" vaccinated after health workers. Asked who needs vaccines after health care workers, Gates told the magazine, ""in the U.S., that would be Black people next, quite honestly, and many other people of color.""

""They are having disproportionate effects from COVID-19. From there, people with underlying health conditions, and then people who are older. Those are the ones who all need it first. We also need to think about essential workers who are keeping our grocery stores open for us so we can buy food, or who are making sure that food moves through the warehouses.""

Live24 didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the way it characterized Gates' statement. Asked about the Live24 article, the Gates Foundation directed USA TODAY to the Time piece.

The Gates Foundation said at the June 4 summit it will donate $1.6 billion over five years to Gavi, a public-private partnership that helps vaccinate half the world's children against disease.

The foundation also said in an online new release that it will donate $100 million to a new Gavi effort to purchase COVID-19 vaccinations for lower-income countries so that ""everyone who needs it can have access to it, starting with health care workers and other high-risk populations.""

The headline, ""Melinda Gates says Black people must be vaccinated first for COVID-19 after health care workers"" is misleading. And it was repeated in the story. Gates did say, however, that Black people and ""many other people of color"" should be next in line for the vaccine after health care workers.

It remains at 1,754. And the total of confirmed and probable cases is 1,404.

There is one additional recovered case and this total is now 1,462 and there are just 21 remaining active cases of COVID-19.

There are no additional deaths to report.

And, currently, there is nobody in hospital with COVID-19 following the discharge of a person from Middlemore Hospital.

Yesterday, our laboratories processed 4,279 tests. So our grand total of tests undertaken to date in New Zealand is 267,435.

Just an update on the NZ COVID Tracer app, there are now 422,000 registrations on that - an increase of 17,000 since yesterday.

Just to remind people, that even registering, which provides your up-to-date contact details with the Ministry of Health is incredibly helpful for both you and for us and our wider efforts. So I continue to encourage to download that app.

There are now over 17,000 QR posters available in businesses around New Zealand, representing that unique New Zealand business number and those are the ones that work with the NZ COVID Tracer app.

We're launching another app today called Āwhina for health care and professional staff. It provides them with access to information on the updated case definition, on local clinical pathways, and on guidance around use of personal protective equipment amongst other things. We're very pleased to be able to provide that information to our health professional workforce so it's available on their mobile device and it is updated as it is updated on our website. We've worked on that app with feedback and input from people across the system.

Finally, on another important topic, back in alert level 4, I certainly noticed, and you may well have, there were many people out walking or cycling to get some fresh air and physical activity to break the monotony of being inside. With less traffic on the roads, I have to say, it was both easy and very enjoyable.

Now there is obviously more traffic on the road under alert level 2, but I would encourage people to still try and build in some physical activity into your days. I know it's getting more difficult with shorter and colder days, especially those mornings, but if you can retain that physical activity and build it into your day, perhaps for local trips - whether it's school, work or to the shops - that will help you stay well over winter.

What you may notice is your local councils providing more space for walking and cycling to make it easier. I commend the councils for doing this. I strongly encourage people to make the most of that. So we'll cooperate - continue to work, as we have been, with the Ministry of Transport, around the benefits of walking and cycling where there is COVID-19 or not.

Media: Would you be comfortable with the country moving to level 1 earlier than a month away?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: The advice we've given, and this was the basis for the Cabinet discussion, and their decision on Monday was to first of all to move the group side up to 100 and then -- size up to 100 and then remain in full alert level 2 for a period of two weeks before moving to alert level 1. But I'm also aware as the Prime Minister said on Monday they will be reconsidering the aLe letter level set -- alert level settings on June 2. The ultimate decision remains with cabinet.

Media: What why do we need to say in alert level 2 for so long?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: The main thing is we need to be certain that the cumulative result of activities means our border procedures are safe and secure especially as contemplate to a possible move to a bubble with Australia and/or more people coming into the country.

Media: Have you seen Winston Peters this morning said we should be in level 1 already and have a Trans-Tasman bubble arranged? Would that be a workable possibility at the moment?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: I can't speak for the Deputy Prime Minister's comments. What I can say is that we are working hard on what alert level 1 will look like. And also separately, but obviously linked very hard with the airline industry, airports, foreign affairs and of course our counterparts in Australia, on what would need to be in place to allow a Trans-Tasman bubble, the key thing is that would require both countries have confidence in the arrangement.

Media: That would be a no right now, from today, tomorrow, immediate future?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: As I say, it is work actively under way but it would require decisions of cabinets of both countries before a Trans-Tasman bubble could go ahead. Our job is to provide really good advice on what needs to be in place both in terms of the pattern of cases in each country but also at the border and on flights to help make sure there was no risk of transmission of any cases between countries.

Media: I understand that that mask-wearing has been completed. Is that the case? When was an announcement made?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: There was a review of the scientific evidence and literature a couple of weeks ago, which is the one on our website. We have asked for further advice from our different technical advisory groups, including our overall technical advisory group. There is not a unanimous view on any of those groups but the weight of the rue is still that our current policy, which is not to either recommend or require widespread use of masks, is the right one at this point in time. But we're just finising -- finalising that. We will make an updated statement available in the next day or two.

Media: Have you changed your position on wearing masks in places like public transport?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: No, we're not. The use of masks needs to be put in the context of the situation we're in right now, alert level 2 going to alert level 1 with a record fifth day in-a-row with no new cases and no evidence of community transmission. That's the evidence that will keep people safe along with physical distancing.

Media: Some say they would like to see international students who want to study at the University of Auckland's Medical School to be able to enter the country. Do you think it's safe to have some students come in if they're paying to stay at hostels?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: This is a piece of work under way, discussions are happening, we're involved in them, led by our education colleagues. The key thing is, any group coming into the country - there's been publicity about some particular people with particular skills who've come in over the last few weeks under a special exemptions policy, anyone who comes into the country needs to do so in a way that complies with that 14-day self or managed isolation, except in very rare circumstances we can be very confident the risk is low. Yes, that does open up the option of international students coming into the country and we would need to make sure that all the arrangements were in place to do so safely.

Media: What alert level will the country have to be at for you to feel comfortable to establish a Trans-Tasman bubble?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: I think that's depend on both governments deciding the risks are able to be managed within an appropriate process. I think the said this on Monday - it is not dependent on us being in alert level 1 but dependent on decision-makers in both countries agreeing to it.

Media: Going back to allowing people back into the country, would you still recommend they stay at hotels in Christchurch or Auckland or could you envisage a time they could self-isolate at home as we did before?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: At this point in time, because the border is so important for us to keep the infection out of the country, we're maintaining the position that it requires, either, quarantine or supervised isolation at one of the facilities that are setup in Auckland or Christchurch.

Media: Is is this the first time -- is this the first time there's been no-one in hospital for COVID-19 since the pandemic lockdown began?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: I think it is, absolutely, yes, we've had a number of people in hospital. Never a big number but I think this is the first time in a couple of months we haven't had someone in hospital. That's another good position to be in.

Media: Yesterday you spoke a bit about exemptions you signed off on. Do you sign off on them all? How many have you signed off on for people in the screen industry?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: The ones in screen industry I don't sign-off on. They're signed off by Minister Twyford and they're related to specific commercial ventures. The very small number I sign off on are around workers with very particular skills, like there were some engineers in Europe what came to fix the so-called ""poo"" pipe here in Wellington. And one I mentioned yesterday who is here to repair X-ray machines. The ones about commercial ventures are not something I sign off on. However, they have to comply with the very strict public health measures in place for earn else. They -- everyone else. They require the 14-day quarantine period.

Media: Do you know how many have been signed off on?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: In the latter category? REPORTER: In both.

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: I've signed off on in a handful. I should say those are people who don't need to do the 14-day quarantine, assuming they've fulfilled a number of requirements. In the case of the other group, it's somewhere between one and 200 but Minister Twyford is the person who will know the exact numbers there.

Media: On that point of allowing further people in, some of the arrangements that these people are quarantining overseas rather than quarantining when they get here?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Not at this point in time. But that is something we are looking at. You would need to be comfort in the quarantine arrangements in the - at the destination, where they're coming from - sorry, at the point of where they're coming from and be confident they were following the same strict public health measures we have in place here. It is something we're looking at a possibility.

Media: Is that something we could move to of sort of there being a visa or something requirement and proof that they have managed to self-isolate and/or quarantine in their country of residence before coming to New Zealand and then they could go straight into their role?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Yes, that's absolutely an option. Another option - we're seeing some countries do this - is requiring testing before people depart from their departure point in a timely way. Both those are options. But at this point in time, we're not using either of those options but they are options for the future.

Media: Note that the Government's response to PPE requests internationally is currently no, can you say which countries have asked for help with PPE?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: No, I don't know which countries have asked that but we can provide that information.

Media: You may have seen people wearing makeshift masks over the mouth, nose area. Does that offer any value for people taking those measures?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: I'm not discouraging people from doing it. If you're going to use a mask or face covering, know how to do that safely. It makes it even more careful to use careful hand hygiene. Because that's where the potential for using face masks can be, with touching inanimate objects and then touching the face. We have done reviews where health care staff may have got infected from - on more than one occasion we believe it is from contaminated surfaces even though they were wearing full PPE. I can't overstate the importance of people using good hand hygiene whether using a face covering or not.

Media: Are you happy with where testing numbers are at? It's dropped off over the last couple of days. Is that to be expected?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: First of all, we always see a drop over the weekend and that tends to flow through into the Monday and Tuesday numbers. It's coming up again, I think, today. We were 4,279 tests processed yesterday. Yes, we will expect to see the numbers come down because - for two reasons. First of all, through the last couple of months we've been testing for people with symptoms. We continue to do that, and that is that the vast majority of the testing that's happening. Anyone who fits that case information on our website, which is very broad still. But secondly, we were doing a lot of testing to try and identify if there was any hidden virus out there in the community. Now that it's clear it's not, we'll be shifting the focus for that testing to the border because that's the area where we'll have the most risk. There is a very specific plan being developed around that which one it has been through cabinet and approved will become in operation from 8 June. It is testing people and looking for any breach at the border with more testing there.

Media: Because of our success in tackling COVID-19, is it going to affect our chances if there's a vaccine created internationally, will it affect our chances of getting the vaccine if we're a country as seen as doing well and doesn't need it as badly as other countries?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: I shouldn't think so. It's still a long way off, for a start. Secondly, as you will have seen in the vaccine strategy that was publicised earlier in the week we have a number of irons in the fire there to make sure that we have access to a vaccine as soon as one's available, and also planning for making sure that we can vaccinate our population.

Media: Following on what you were saying there, new testing at the borders, does that mean we could see more people coming through the borders?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Ah, regardless of whether we're seeing more people coming through the borders what we're looking at is whether we routinely test everyone coming through the border at some point during their quarantine period. But also, it's about testing of people who are working at the border, either at airports or ports, or in those quarantine facilities. So that will be where the focus of our asymptomatic testing will be.

Media: Back to masks, where does the discrepancy lie at the moment?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: There are a range of views whether widespread mask use whether on public transport or in other public settings by the general public is worth doing from a sense of that the benefits outweigh the potential risks at this point in time. But it's just one of those things that's under active conversation.

Media: One question from our sports team. The Tokyo Olympics have been postponed to the middle of next year. Do you think a vaccine would be ready by that time, and do you think the Olympics should go ahead if there isn't a vaccine and you are going to have thousands of athletes around?

Dr Ashley Bloomfield: I'm prepared to answer most questions but I don't think I can offer any sound insights into that particular issue. I'm sorry. OK. Thank you very much, everybody.",mainstream,M09d05,vaccine.covid
785,"MILANO (Reuters) - Italian biotech firm Rottapharm Biotech is looking for more investors at home to help fund development of a vaccine against COVID-19 as the country looks to produce domestic supplies of medication to fight the pandemic, its CEO told Reuters.

The comments came after the privately owned company on Wednesday pledged 3 million euros ($3.4 million) towards testing for a vaccine called Covid-eVax that was launched in February by biotech company Takis based in Rome.

“We hope to be able to bring on board other private and institutional investors,” Lucio Rovati, CEO at Rottapharm Biotech, said in an interview on Wednesday.

“It is essential that our country is also directly involved in the development of a vaccine resulting from Italian research.”

The cash for Takis, which was founded by a group of biologists and researchers at the R&D arm of pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co, will go towards producing doses for the first clinical trials which will start in the autumn, Rovati said. The first results are expected March next year, he said.

At least two other trials are underway by domestic pharmaceutical research companies in Italy, one of the European countries worst hit by the coronavirus.

Countries are looking for ways to shore up supplies of potential vaccines as drugmakers rush to develop a treatment or vaccine for the coronavirus, which has infected more than 6.53 million people and killed over 385,000.

Some European governments are speeding up talks with drugmakers to make advance purchases of vaccines currently under development, following moves from the United States to fund trials and agree supplies of vaccines in advance.",mainstream,M08312,vaccine
297,"There are 102 candidate vaccines being explored as a means of ending the COVID-19 pandemic, as of April 30. Eight of these have already made it to clinical trials in humans, and another 94 are in the pre-clinical evaluation stage.

These candidates also fall into eight different categories of vaccine development strategy that are being explored. While it still doesn’t guarantee success, this is in effect the biological equivalent of hedging our bets in the hope that one of the strategies will pay off.

But if and when a successful vaccine is found, we still have to manufacture enough of it to immunise huge numbers of people all around the world. And how long this will take, and what is involved, will depend on which strategy is found to work, because different vaccines are made in different ways.

Despite arguments about lack of preparedness concerning PPE and testing, the UK has been on the front foot when it comes to identifying suitable candidate vaccines. It is leading the charge to ramp up production, having invested more than any other country in doing so, according to the health secretary, Matt Hancock.

The UK’s two leading candidate vaccines, being developed by the University of Oxford and Imperial College London respectively, both use very different approaches that were already under investigation in the lab for other diseases.

Oxford’s candidate, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, uses a genetically modified chimpanzee adenovirus as a “vector” to carry the genetic sequence of a protein from the COVID-19 coronavirus to the human body. The body can then learn to recognise the coronavirus and start producing antibodies to fight it. This is the same technique the team previously developed for the closely related Mers coronavirus, which showed promise in animal and early-stage human testing.

Usually vaccine development takes years, but human clinical trials for the Oxford vaccine candidate are underway, just three months after the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was released for study. This is thanks to a specialist adenovirus manufacturing platform adapted as part of work by the EPSRC UCL-Oxford Future Vaccine Manufacturing Research Hub (Vax Hub), as well as next-generation gene sequencing methods that have enabled the team to proceed at breakneck speed.

Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has announced it will develop, manufacture and distribute the vaccine (if it’s successful) around the world. But to do this, it will need to find a way to scale up production without critically affecting the supply of other vital vaccines.

Global manufacturing facilities are adept at producing millions of vaccine doses against influenza, measles and polio. They have strategies in place to step up production at times of increased demand, such as for the annual winter flu season. But we are in unprecedented times, and the global demand for a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine will be on a scale never before seen, likely resulting in key production and distribution bottlenecks.

Vaccine production requires complex manufacturing processes involving the production of living organisms that, in turn, generate the genetically-modified virus on which the vaccine is based. And we must get the manufacturing right. These vaccines will be administered to healthy people to generate immunity to the virus. Any faults would risk their safety and a long-term loss of public confidence.

But there is cause for cautious optimism. As we await the clinical trial outcomes for the Oxford vaccine, behind the scenes there has been a flurry of activity to adapt existing manufacturing technologies and processes to make the adenovirus vector it relies on.

The manufacturing process for the Oxford vaccine will begin by encoding the coronavirus surface protein into the adenovirus vector. “Producer cells”, usually human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, will then be used as mini-factories to produce the vector particles. The producer cells will be grown at scale in a bioreactor, a vessel that tightly controls the environmental conditions to optimise cell growth.

The cells will then be put through a series of steps to purify and concentrate the final adenovirus vector, including filtration and centrifugation (spinning it very fast in order to separate different particles). Finally, the solution will be formulated into a usable product and kept stable by storing it between 2°C and 8°C.

However, the final concentration of the solution can vary significantly, and it is the lack of an effective manufacturing process to resolve this problem that limits current production on a mass scale. This will be the significant challenge AstraZeneca will face in translating the lab-based Oxford process to something akin to industrial manufacturing.

Of course, all these efforts will only come into play if the Oxford vaccine (or potentially another in the same category) is found to work. Other vaccine candidates, such as that being developed by Imperial, will require a substantially different manufacturing process. In these unprecedented times, the world’s vaccine experts will have to work with unprecedented speed and innovation to deliver a way to save potentially millions of lives and start returning society to normal.",mainstream,M0b82f,gmo; vaccine; vaccine.covid

 Abstract 

 

 

 

 Rather than a public health emergency, the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,"" generally called SARS, is best diagnosed as a ""Sickening and Repulsive Scam."" This article argues that this unprecedented viral attack is, alternatively, an ingenious social experiment featuring institutionalized bioterrorism for widespread psycho-social control. The outcome of this experiment, whether it leads to population reduction or not, depends on you. 

 

 

 

 Background 

 

 

 

 You are about to read much neglected truths pertaining to this bizarre new pneumonia-like illness called SARS. Authorities explain this acronym for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome as simply the latest threat in an ongoing series of attacks on humanity by mysteriously mutating ""supergerms."" Yet, a careful study of this multi-disciplinary subjectÊ reveals something amiss far more insidious and deadly than SARS. This spreading scourge of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome stretching from Asia to North America has all the earmarks of a novel social experiment in population manipulation aimed to culture the mass mind for the arrival of ""the Big One""-a biological agent that will facilitate decimation of approximately a third to half of the world's population, in keeping with current official population reduction objectives. 

 

 

 

 Naturally you would be disinclined to believe the above sentence. Open-mindedness in this domain threatens exposure to a ""Twilight Zone"" of knowledge in which reality is far stranger than fiction. Your first instinct, therefore, might be to close this page in favor of the next SARS site that promises more of the standard treatments broadcast on every official news page and government report on this subject. But, if you choose to have your worldview shattered by considering the little known truths surrounding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, then continue reading. . . .

 Introduction 

 

 

 

 My name is Dr. Leonard Horowitz, and I will be your SARS tour guide on this website. As a Harvard graduate in public health, and expert in the fields of medical sociology, behavioral science, and emerging diseases, I am best known for my work exposing the man-made origin of HIV/AIDS in the national bestselling book, Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola-Nature, Accident or Intentional? (Tetrahedron Press, 1998; 1-888-508-4787; http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=4) This was my tenth book that American grassroots activists, medical physicians and scientists included, made a national bestseller. U.S. Government documents that I reprinted for the first time for the world to see were strong endorsements for this work. Included here are stunning and tragic contracts under which numerous AIDS-like and Ebola-like viruses were bioengineered by the U.S. Army's 6th leading biological weapons contractor-Litton Bionetics-a medical subsidiary of the mega-military weapons contractor called Litton Industries. You can get free information on this man-made vaccine-transmitted theory of AIDS at http://www.originofAIDS.com. Here I focus your attention on SARS, and what mainstream sources of information are withholding about this new pandemic.

 

 This narrative was written immediately following my return from Total Health 2003-anÊ alternative medical conference in Toronto, Canada, held March 27-30, 2003. I landed in Toronto the day that SARS began dominating front page headlines in every major newspaper in the country. Five consecutive days of unprecedented media blitz in Canada's largest city over the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome left the entire population frightened and bewildered.

 

 Having been well-trained in media health promotion and persuasion methods from my behavioral science studies at Harvard University, I concluded that something akin to a social experiment was underway. With SARS, people were being frightened beyond reason, I realized. The classic definition of phobia was being manifested on a social, if not global, scale.

 

 Surely the SARS death rate, approximately 3%, was insufficient cause for such widespread panic. The media successfully whipped the Canadian population into a trembling mass of masked and quarantined ""sheeple."" Officials were forced to direct the closing of hospitals, restaurants, schools, and workplaces with only two deaths reported at the onset of the media onslaught. Within a few days, more than a thousand healthcare workers volunteered for home quarantine because of SARS. Otherwise, they faced legal arrest and incarceration as advised by the World Health Organization. You will find many of these reports from Canada's daily newspapers, documenting these facts, as well as incoming American press reports, in the archive files of this website.

 

 Mission

 

 I have dedicated this website to examining the social and political implications, as well as the correlates (i.e., things related to) and antecedents (i.e., factors or events that predated or precipitated) this new SARS pandemic. By examining this illness's etiology, which lies more in the realm of global politics, corporate profits, and population control, than elsewhere, this information offers educated people an alternative to the fright and irrational behaviors promulgated by ""mainstream"" propagandists including news sources and health officials better known as ""spin doctors.""

 

 Most intelligent persons will conclude from the following information that this new microbial attack was premeditated and precedent-setting. In other words, SARS is a well orchestrated social experiment.

 

 Who is behind this SARS madness? I accept the risk of triggering your ""conspiracy theory"" buttons by identifying the widely recognized ""global military-medical-petrochemical-pharmaceutical cartel"" as the only suspect that can wield the powers necessary to effect these frightening outcomes.

 

 Although you may find it comforting to simply consider this a conspiracy theory, I view SARS is a huge conspiracy with very few witting villains. Clearly, what you are witnessing is a well organized terror campaign carried out by mostly well-meaning, yet grossly ignorant, ""authorities""-medically indoctrinated and virtually hypnotized ""Manchurian candidates"" if you will allow me to postulate.

 

 Indeed, people are dying from SARS. Yet, I diagnose this illness, by medical-sociological parameters, as a grotesque scam perpetrated for a greater purpose than simply fueling a multi-billion dollar ""cottage health industry,"" as some analysts have written.

 

 Alternatively, I propose that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, may be best diagnosed by SARS's telltale dependence on the propaganda used to herald its presence, prompt hysteria, and broadly engage social and economic resources. In military intelligence circles this is called standard ""psychological operations"" (PSYOPs).

 

 I further suggest this fright's likeliest purpose is in facilitating evolving economic and political agendas that ultimately include targeting approximately half the world's current population for elimination. Much of this will be accomplished, not with SARS, but quite effectively and efficiently by the widely anticipated ""Big One"" discussed later on this website in a feature article written for the Associated Press by Emma Ross.

 

 

 

 ""[T]here's fame, fortune, and big budgets in sounding the 'emerging infection' alarm and warning of our terrible folly in being unprepared."" 

 

 Michael Fumento, National Post, March 28, 2003

 

 

 

 This concept of a microbiological Armageddon is not new to most readers. ""Experts"" have been predicting the arrival of a super-plague for decades. What is HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS about the mysterious and terrifying arrival of SARS is its timing. It arrived virtually synchronous with the global war on terrorism, and the Anglo-American war with Iraq. This is pathognomonic (i.e., symptomatic and characteristic) of what is predicted and explained in the book, Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare (Tetrahedron Publishing Group, 2001; http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=3), a prophetically-titled text that predated the 9-11 attacks on America by several months, and provides a contextual analysis of this current condition and spreading plague of phobic deception.

 

 This work, and this SARS website, in essence, offers insight into the broad application of a new form of institutionalizedÊ ""bioterrorism"" consistent with state sponsored biological warfare. Saddam Hussein is said to have exposed populations in his and adjacent lands with biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction. These advancing infectious disease attacks in North America are sanctioned by medical-pharmaceutical and allied military industrialists. They complement the global ""War on Terrorism,"" and bioterror-influenced culture, as additionally profitable, population-controlling, threats.

 

 

 

 Perceiving Harsh Reality Versus Generally Promoted Myths

 

 What lay persons view as ever increasing madness in the world around them, is eerily consistent with earlier globalist think tank recommendations for the development and deployment, in the new millennium, of ""conflicts short of war,"" and ""economic substitutes for standard militarization."" These developments were adequately detailed and referenced in Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism, and Toxic Warfare (http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=3). As compared with the first and second world wars, these smaller, more manageable, and better controlled conflicts, orchestrated events, and state sponsored threats, were consistently selected options among foreign policy makers and government officials beginning in the late 1960s.

 

 Henry Kissinger, for instance, as National Security Advisor (NSA) under Richard Nixon, oversaw foreign policy while considering Third World population reduction ""necessities"" for the U.S., Britain, Germany, and other allies. This Bush nominee to direct the 9-11 conspiracy investigation, a reputed war criminal, then selected the option to have the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) develop biological weapons, according to the U.S. Congressional Record of 1975. Among these biologicals were germs far deadlier than the SARS agent (thought to be a strain of coronavirus). Under Kissinger's watch as NSA, influenza and parainfluenza viruses were, for example, recombined with quick acting leukemia viruses (acute lymphocytic leukemia) to deliver a weapon that potentially spread cancer like the flu. (More on this later.) These incredible realities have been generally neglected, if not officially secreted.

 

 

 

 Weapons selections like these continue to the present day not simply by radical terrorist groups, but also among a handful of military cartel industrialists that continue to sell weapons of mass destruction to those who can afford them.

 

 These conflicts short of major wars like WWI and WWII, and war economy substitutes (such as the ""War on AIDS,"" ""War on Crime,"" ""War on Drugs,"" ""War on Terrorism,"" ""War on Cancer,"" the environmental protection movement, and the ""Star Wars"" Strategic Defense Initiative, all require sophisticated propaganda programs employing fear campaigns for social acceptance and popular support. These PSYOPS for command and control warfare (C2W), military and behavior experts correctly advise, best support a well-defined rapidly evolving ""Revolution in Military Affairs"" (RMA) which is synonymous to a the evolution into ""a form of human slavery"" in which the captives-the world's population, including you and your loved ones-would not perceive this enslavement.

 

 The RMA incorporates the use of debilitating biological weapons and incapacitating chemicals, similar to the toxic carcinogenic organophosphate pesticides deployed against mosquitoes in the ""War Against the West Nile Virus."" These are often called ""non-lethal warfare"" agents, yet are indeed deadly. Death results slowly along with advancing mortality from such toxic exposures. Larger profits are made by allied pharmaceutical and medical industrialists as victims of the ""non-lethal"" exposures die slowly, commonly in expensive hospitals and long-term care facilities, from chronic debilitating diseases. Most of these ailments, including the plethora of autoimmune diseases and newer cancers, were virtually non-existent 50 years ago. This fact, lone, strongly suggests a modern socio-economic and political conspiracy. Unless you simply wish to believe it is God's will or man's greed that has brought these conditions to bear upon humanity.

 

 ""People are all too willing to relinquish their civil rights and personal freedoms in the wake of such engineered frights.""

 

 In recent decades, military think tanks prescribed options for ""conflicts short of war"" that included novel population control policies and methodologies. These provided for:

 

 1) the establishment of new profit centers as traditional large-scale wars were phased out by the new millennium.Ê Examples here include the many multi-billion dollar ""homeland security"" programs that emerged from post-9/11 legislation, such as those securing air travel and mail delivery. These are just two examples of myriad evolving profit centers fueled by frights and institutionalized terror campaigns; 

 

 

 

 2) the development of advanced persuasion and population control programs, with high tech methods of support, to facilitate ""a form of slavery"" in which humanity would not realize it had become conditioned into relinquishing personal and social freedoms for the mirage of health, safety, and security. These provided other profit centers and population control options. Once habituated to modern lifestyle restrictions, such as enforced health and travel restrictions, the general population might become virtually ""enslaved"" with little effective resistance, widespread pharmaceutical dependence (particularly using anti-depressant drugs), through the use of PSYOPs. Media distractions and manipulations were considered essential in achieving this objective; and

 

 3) lucrative depopulation methods to be employed, including the conditions and resources necessary for culling ""excess populations.""

 

 SARS, when considered in light of these social and political impositions, can be clearly understood.

 

 SARS for Profit

 

 By Friday, March 28, 2003, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, Michael Fumento, published a thesis in Toronto similar to the one I advance here. This well regarded author of The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS: How a Tragedy Has Been Distorted by the Media and Partisan Politics (Regnery Gateway, 1990) provided an editorial titled ""Super-bug or Super Scare""Ê published in the National Post (p. A16.). This included the following:

 

 It's ""an incident of unprecedented scope and magnitude,"" according to Toronto health officials, who warn Canadians to ""quarantine themselves,"" wear masks, and in some cases stay home. Ontario Health Minister Tony Clement has declared a ""health emergency."" The meda have dubbed it the ""mysterious killer pneumonia"" or ""super-pneumonia."" 

 

 

 

 But a bit of knowledge and perspective will kill this panic. 

 

 

 

 Start with those scary tags, ""Mysterious"" in modern medicine usually means we haven't yet quite identified the cause, although we have now done so here. What's been officially named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is one or more strains of coronavirus, commonly associated with colds. ""Killer pneumonia"" is practically a redundancy, since so many types of pneumonia (there are more than 50) do kill. 

 

 

 

 The real questions are: How lethal, how transmissible, and how treatable is this strain? And the answers leave no grounds for excitement, much less panic. 

 

 

 

 Super? 

 

 

 

 At this writing, SARS appears to have killed 54 people out of almost 1,400 afflicted according to the World Health Organization, a death rate of less than 4%. But since this only takes into account those ill enough to seek medical help, the actual ratio of deaths to infections is certainly far less. [This is a tremendous understatement.] 

 

 

 

 In contrast, the 1918-1919 flu pandemic killed approximately a third of the 60 million afflicted. 

 

 

 

 Further, virtually all of the deaths have been in countries with horrendous medical care, primarily mainland China. In this country, three people have died out of 28 afflicted according to Health Canada, but that may say more about Canada's vaunted national health-care system than about SARS. In the United States, 40 people have been hospitalized with SARS with zero deaths. 

 

 

 

 Conversely, other forms of pneumonia kill more than 40,000 North Americans yearly. 

 

 

 

 Transmissibility? 

 

 

 

 Each year millions of North Americans alone contract the flu. Compre that with those 64 SARS cases diagnosed thus far and, well, you can't compare them. Further evidence that SARS is hard to catch is that health care workers and family members of victims are by far the most likely to become afflicted. 

 

 

 

 Treatability? 

 

 

 

 ""There are few drugs and no vaccines to fight this pathogen,"" one wire service panted breathlessly. But there are also few drugs to fight any type of viral pneumonia, because we have very few antiviral medicines. . . .Ê [Consider also approximately 97% of cases naturally defended themselves successfully against this plague. What did they, or their immune systems do right? Why is this rarely, if ever, mentioned or investigated by any mainstream source? Alternatively, Mr. Fumento mentions ""Ribovirin,"" which he states, ""appears to be effective against SARS.""

 

 [Is this another form of medically-sanctioned institutionalized bias that even the well- intentioned Fumento expresses? Consider the fact that SARS only existed a few weeks prior to Fumento's editorial. In fact, the coronavirus had been questionably cultured from SARS patients only days before Fumento's wrote the above. Surely no clinical trials matching Ribovirin with SARS had ever been conducted. At best, then, this statement reflects either drug company propaganda and/or health official speculations.]

 

 Fumento continued:

 

 ""So why all the fuss over this one strain of pneumonia? 

 

 

 

 First, never ignore the obvious: It does sell papers. 

 

 

 

 But an added feature to this scare is the cottage industry that's grown up around so-called ""emerging infectious diseases."" Some diseases truly fit the bill, with 

 

 

 

 AIDS the classic example. Others, like West Nile Virus in North America, are new to a given area. 

 

 

 

 But there's fame, fortune, and big budgets in sounding the ""emerging infection"" alarm and warning of our terrible folly in being unprepared. The classic example is Ebola virus, . . . [Mr. Fumento downplays the Ebola threat here.] 

 

 

 

 Yet, you'd almost swear that every out break of Ebola is actually taking place in Toronto or New York. . . . 

 

 

 

 . . . The U.S. government and various North American universities have also seen these faux plagues as budget boosters. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a journal called Emerging Infectious Diseases, though in any given issue it's hard to find an illness that actually fits the definition. 

 

 

 

 The U.S. Institute of Medicine just issued a report warning that the United States is grossly unprepared to deal with emerging pathogens. Soothingly, however, it adds that it's nothing that an injection of tax dollars can't cure. 

 

 

 

 Meanwhile, a disease that emerged eons ago called malaria kills up to 2.7 million people yearly. Another, tuberculosis, kills perhaps three million more. Both afflict North Americans, albeit at very low rates. 

 

 

 

 The big money and headlines may be in the so-called 'emerging diseases,' but the cataclysmic illnesses come from the same old boring killers. In fact, there may be no fatal illness that will cause fewer deaths in North America this year than SARS."" 

 

 

 

 Michael Fumento concluded by asking, and challenging you to consider:

 

 ""How do our priorities get so twisted? There's your mystery?"" 

 

 

 

 

 Favored Economic Victims of SARS and Other SCAMS in the RMA

 

 Contrary to Mr. Fumento's well considered conclusion that SARS boosts budgets of those who sound alarms loudest, the mainstream media has consistently attempted to have you think otherwise. One article in Canada's leading financial newspaper, the Financial Post, on March 31, 2003, heralds, ""SARS virus begins to take toll on global economy.""

 

 With no mention of the far larger number of people and industries that profit from such plagues, and the fears surrounding them, reporter Jacqueline Thorpe's editor assigned her to focus on the airline and tourism industries that are ""particularly hard hit."" She wrote:

 

 ""Businesses in Singapore have shut down, planes over Hong Kong are empty and thousands of people in Toronto have been forced into quarantine as a deadly pneumonia virus adds yet another strain to the beleaguered global economy. 

 

 

 

 While severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may not be as debilitating as war in Iraq, slumping stock markets or a weak U.S. labor market, it is already starting to take its toll on some Asian economies and the long-suffering tourism industry. . . . 

 

 

 

 In Hong Kong, where the number of infections leapt by 60 to 530 over the weekend and 13 people have died, economists at JPMorgan Chase estimate the economy could lose 0.2% to 0.5% of gross domestic product every month from the drop in tourism and private consumption. . . . 

 

 

 

 Businesses in many Chinese shopping districts [in Toronto] have reported a sharp drop in business. 

 

 

 

 Dennis Yuent, a merchant in Pacific Mall in Toronto --Ê North America's largest shopping mall - said his sales have dropped by about 70% since the SARS scare began.""

 

 Notice that the expert bankers at JPMorgan Chase, and Ms. Thorpe, failed to mention the stunning growth in medical/pharmaceutical/security/and law enforcement sectors, and the increase in ""gross domestic product"" due to SARS and similar scams.

 

 In the weeks and months following the 9-11 attacks on America, I traced the widely publicized anthrax mailings ""mystery"" to U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) commissioned biological weapons contractors with ties to Britain's MI6, Porton Down, the Anglo-American pharmaceutical cartel, including the Bayer, Hoecsht, Baxter and Merck Corporations, and ultimately to George Soros-a global banking and investment industrialist and chief money manager for Europe's wealthiest oligarchy-owners of the Genomic Institute that performed the DNA sequencing on behalf of the anthrax vaccine maker/British Porton Down subsidiary, Bioport. A complete expos on this topic is provided at =http://www.tetrahedron.org/articles/anthrax/anthrax_espionage.html.

 

 

 

 China's Threat and the Anglo-American RMA

 

 It seems suspiciously convenient that the travel industry, and Asian travel in particular, would be the greatest victims at a time when globalists (i.e., global industrialists including members of the ultra-rich) have directed military and political policies consistent with the RMA and ""conflicts short of war"" agenda. Reducing travel helps to secure wide ranging RMA objectives.

 

 Think about it. Less mobile populations, and less people in general, are easier to control, especially with increased exposure to television while having to waste their time at home. This is entirely consistent with the ""Changing Images of Mankind"" advanced by Willis Harmon for Anglo-American military and business interests. The effect of this similar to forced ""quarantine."" Isn't this consistent with a ""form of slavery in which humanity would not know it had become enslaved?""

 

 People are all too willing to relinquish their civil rights and personal freedoms in the wake of such engineered frights. The passage of the infamous ""Homeland Security Act"" in America, and its counterpart in Canada, are classic examples of this societal direction, forced legislation, and egregious manipulation.

 

 How convenient that Asia, and China in particular, is said to be the origin of this North American scourge at a time when Chinese-Anglo-American relations are strained to say the least.

 

 In the days preceding the emergence of the first SARS cases, American raced to the Pacific Rim to impact escalating aggressions on the Korean peninsula. Communist China-a ""most favored"" trading partner with America, is politically allied with several American enemies, including those said to possess weapons of mass destruction, including Iraq. Coincidental? Not likely when viewing the larger political picture involving the Ango-American oligarchy's RMA and instigated ""conflicts short of war.""

 

 Ultimately, ""We the People"" have become the greatest victims of this latest fright, and the larger political agendas it serves. 

 

 

 

 The Media's Role in SARS: Setting a Precedent

 

 Consider the fact the media's mainstream has been heavily influenced, if not entirely controlled, by multi-national corporate sponsors protecting and advancing the interests of a relatively small number of global industrialists (I have called ""globalists;"" and others say the ""ruling elite,"" or ""European oligarchy""). Also recall that the focus of news providers, on any given day or hour, results from intelligence agency directives, according to reputable authorities including myriad retired news officials and intelligence officers. So ask and answer the following intelligent questions:

 

 * Why have American military officials, beginning with Secretary of Defense William Cohen during the Clinton years, publicized America's greatest vulnerability lies in the realm of biological weapons wielded by terrorists? Is this not a form of treason against the United States to relay such sensitive intelligence to potential enemies through the mainstream press? During the McCarthy era, Hollywood producers were persecuted for having the slightest liberal or Communist sympathies. What has changed to allow the Hollywood production of ""Black Hawk Down"" to be used by Saddam Hussein and his military and intelligence commanders to educate and inspire his troops?

 

 * Why does the mainstream media continue to foretell of the expected arrival of the ""Big One""-an influenza virus that will produce a super-flu that will kill billions of people, like the ""Spanish flu"" did between 1918-19, while totally disregarding the individuals, organizations, and laboratories that have labored to produce these weapons of mass destruction? Even the devastating Spanish Flu virus has been, literally, unearthed for further study and, do you suppose, deployment?

 

 *

 Why was the ""Spanish flu"" influenza virus called the ""Spanish flu"" when it originated, by historic accounts, in Tibet in 1917? It is said that Spanish newspapers were the only ones reporting on the great plague due to their neutrality over World War I politics. However, Spain was as dear to America then as Communist China is to the United States today. The ""Spanish flu"" was named such following two decades of disputes between America and Spain over colonization of the Caribbean Islands, Hawaii and the Phillippines beginning with the Spanish American war that ended in the Phillippines in 1902. Does this history appear to be repeating with the advent of SARS, allegedly from China?

 

 * If the legions of recognized authorities herald the coming of the ""Big One,"" why do the same persons disregard this author's publication of U.S. Government, National Institutes of Health, and National Cancer Institute documents showing that the U.S. Army's 6th top biological weapons contractor in 1969-1970 prepared mutants of influenza and para-influenza viruses recombined with acute lymphocytic leukemia viruses? In other words, how would you like to have a strain of the flu that spreads cancer by sneezing? Can you even rationalize the develop of such a virus-lymphocytic leukemia that kills most victims in just a few weeks following airborne transmission?

 

 These have been shown clearly on page 452 of the national bestselling book, Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola-Nature, Accident or Intentional? http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=4) in circulation since 1996. A copy of this ""menu"" of infectious agents, potential biological weapons, listing several mutant recombinants involving flu viruses is posted below for your inspection.

 

 Why haven't you previously heard about these developments? Especially since these documents have been extensively circulated throughout newsrooms and government offices, particularly those engaged in public health, since 1996? 

 

 

 

 Finally, how, if I published this information, and definitive documentation, and sent this critical intelligence along with urgent pleas to approximately 8,500 members of the mainstream media (as I have done this week and on dozens of previous occasions for the past seven years) can you turn on your television sets and gain nothing but the ""same old song?""

 

 If you have considered and answered the above questions, doesn't it make sense that America is being manipulated, if not targeted, for the purpose of advancing a global population reduction agenda, if not World War III?

 

 The ""Big One"" is Coming

 

 The U.S. Army's 6th top biological weapons contractor in 1969-1970 prepared mutants of influenza and para-influenza viruses recombined with acute lymphocytic leukemia viruses. In other words, how would you like to have a strain of the flu that spreads quick killing cancer by sneezing?

 

 According to most emerging disease experts and government health officials the 'Big One"" might arrive at any time.

 

 Emma Ross of the Associated Press reported on SARS as the World Health Organization (WHO) launched its ""crisis plan to attack"" the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. WHO, as you may recall, is a U.N. sponsored organization that is rumored to have helped spread AIDS to Africa by way of contaminated hepatitis B and/or polio vaccinations. There is a reasonable amount of evidence to support this contention.

 

 More disconcerting, the U.N. is known to be heavily influenced by Rockefeller family members and corporate interests. History shows Rockefeller fortunes built the U.N. building in New York City. During WWII, the Rockefeller family and their Standard Oil Company supported Hitler more than they did the allies according to court records. One federal judge ruled Rockefeller committed ""treason"" against the United States.Ê Following WWII, according to attorney John Loftus-an official Nazi war crimes investigator-Nelson Rockefeller persuaded the U.N.'s South American voting block to favor Israel's creation only to assure secrecy regarding his support for the Nazis. Earlier that century, John D. Rockefeller joined Prescott Bush and the British Royal Family in sponsoring the eugenics initiatives that gave rise to Hitler's racial hygiene programs. During the same period the Rockefeller family virtually monopolized American medicine, American pharmaceutics and the cancer and genetics industries. Today, the Rockefeller family, foundation, U.N. and WHO remain at the forefront of administering ""population programs"" designed to reduce world populations to more manageable levels. As per a recent advertisement Foreign Affairs-a prestigious political periodical published by the David Rockefeller directed Council on Foreign Relations-the U.S. population is being targeted for a 50% reduction.

 

 ""We've never faced anything on this scale with such a global reach,'"" said Dr. David Heymann, of the WHO, regarding SARS.

 

 ""This is the first time that a global network of laboratories are sharing information, samples, blood, pictures,"" added Dr. Klaus Stohr, a WHO virologist coordinating labs internationally. ""Basically overnight, there are no secrets, there is no jealousy, there is no competition in the face of a global health emergency. This is a phenomenal network. 

 

 

 

 In one week, the Associated Press reported, the WHO's lab network had ""isolated the SARS virus, produced a preliminary diagnostic test, and narrowed the virus' identity down to two candidates - neither one a new strain of influenza. In the following week, various antiviral drugs were tested as possible treatments. 

 

 

 

 ""Meanwhile, doctors were also sharing information. . . . WHO coordinated exchanges of symptoms, case histories and possible treatments. . . . Asian doctors talked about various therapies they were trying; later, the Europeans and North Americans conferred.

 

 ""In eastern Asia - at government invitation - expert field teams of WHO staffers and scientists from international institutes were sent to Vietnam, Hong Kong and China to figure out how the disease was spread, to help treat patients and advise how to control it.

 

 ""Aileen Plant, an infectious disease epidemiologist from Curtin University in Australia, led a dozen experts in Hanoi, one of the hard-hit areas. Her international team focused on the Hanoi French Hospital, which closed its doors to new patients and quarantined those inside. Many of the sick were doctors and nurses. . . .

 

 ""With newly released figures from China, there have been more than 1,500 cases and slightly more than 50 deaths worldwide, including three in Canada. The WHO believes the disease is generally under control, but Hong Kong remains a challenge. In mainland China, the picture is somewhat murky. . . .

 

 ""Many inside the WHO see the SARS operation as a kind of dress rehearsal - 'good practice,' Heymann said - for the Big One, the inevitable killer flu pandemic that experts say could come at any time.

 

 ""'This isn't the Big One, because I think it's being contained.'""

 

 What You Should Do

 

 The above information has been meticulously documented and referenced in this author's two previous works, Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola-Nature, Accident or Intentional? and Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare. It begs the question of what to do? There are personal and socio-political directions for a rational response. Here are my recommendations.

 

 1. Personally, you and your loved ones are encouraged to do everything in your power to lift your natural immunity to beyond the 3rd percentile that is apparently necessary to prevent your death from SARS, or other more pathogenic agents.ÊÊ For instructions in this regard, I recommend learning from various alternative medical websites, including www.healingcelebrations.com. These are dedicated to helping you improve your health naturally.

 

 There are five practical steps you can take that are detailed therein, and in my Healing Celebrations: Miraculous Recoveries Through Ancient Scripture, Natural Medicine and Modern Science (Tetrahedron Publishing Group, 2000). These include: 1) detoxification, 2) deacidification/alkalinization, 3) immunity boosting, 4) oxygenation, and 5) bioelectric/energetic methods.

 

 2. Socially, you should alert your family and friends regarding these matters in an effort to prevent their victimization, media manipulation, and continued confusion.

 

 3. Politically, you may wish to become active in an effort to bring greater public attention to these appalling realities. ""We the People"" can make a difference in halting the ongoing genocides being conducted under the guises of ""medical science"" and ""public health."" This was recently demonstrated when our revealing light of truth illuminated the risks and myths surrounding the deadly smallpox vaccine. Grassroots publications like Smallpox Alert, published by the Idaho Observer, and the affiliated website at www.allaboutsmallpox.com, created a massive backlash bringing the entire program to an embarrassing halt. By forwarding this article and related website, www.SARSscam.com, to as many people as possible, we can effect the same successful result.

 

 

 

 About the Author

 

 Leonard G. Horowitz, D.M.D., M.A., M.P.H., is an internationally known authority in the overlapping fields of public health, behavioral science, emerging diseases, and bioterrorism. He received his doctorate in medical dentistry from Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in 1977, was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship in behavioral science at the University of Rochester, earned a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University, and another Master of Arts degree in health education from Beacon College, all before joining the research faculty at Harvard. Dr. Horowitz is best known for his national bestselling book, Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola-Nature, Accident or Intentional? (Tetrahedron Press, 1998; 1-888-508-4787; http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=4) which recently resulted in the United Stated General Accounting Office investigating the man-made origin of AIDS theory. (See: http://www.healingcelebrations.com/gao.htm) Dr. Horowitz's work in the field of vaccination risk awareness has prompted at least three Third World nations to change their vaccination policies. His recent stunning testimony before the United States Congress' Government Reform Committee, literally brought the hearing to a halt. (See: http://www.healingcelebrations.com/Disease%20Deities%20on%20Capitol%20Hill%20Address%20Autism.htm) ÊDr. Horowitz questioned government health officials regarding a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) secreted report showing a definitive link between the mercury ingredient (i.e., Thimerosal), common to most vaccinations, and the skyrocketing rates of autism and behavioral disorders affecting our children and the future our nation.

 

 Incredibly, Dr. Horowitz alerted the FBI, in writing and in person, one week before the first anthrax mailing was announced in the press, that a ""major anthrax fright"" was in the process of unfolding that demanded the FBI's urgent attention. Needless to say they did not heed Dr. Horowitz's prophetic warning.

 

 Moreover, three months before the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Dr. Horowitz released his thirteenth book, prophetically titled Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare (http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=3),. The book focuses on the West Nile Virus as an act of bioterroism, and considers what and who is really behind this and other recent outbreaks. Dr. Horowitz argues that his disclosures expose the roots of global terrorism, along with the individuals and organizations at the heart of what he calls ""the petrochemical-pharmaceutical cartel."" He believes this ""multi-national corporate beast"" is in the process of committing global genocide, profiting from engineered frights, and at the same time, most efficiently culling targeted populations considered excessive.

 

 As you may have heard, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called for an investigation into the links between the recent West Nile Virus outbreaks and bioterrrorism. Dr. Horowitz is among the leading pioneers of this theory.Ê

239,"(Reuters Health) - - Pregnant women who get the flu, or a flu vaccine, are not increasing their baby’s risk for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a new study suggests.

Researchers analyzed data on 196,929 children born from 2000 through 2010 in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system after at least 24 weeks gestation.

During follow-up periods ranging from two to 15 years, 1.6 percent of the children were diagnosed with ASD. Among the mothers of that 1.6 percent, fewer than 1 percent had the flu while pregnant, and about 23 percent had gotten a flu vaccine.

Neither influenza infection nor vaccination during pregnancy were tied to children being diagnosed with ASD, the research team reports in JAMA Pediatrics.

“Our data showed pretty convincingly that there was no association with influenza at any time during pregnancy and autism in the child,” said senior author Lisa Croen, of Kaiser Permanente Northern California in Oakland.

“We’re not recommending that any changes be made to the vaccination policy,” Croen told Reuters Health. “We are encouraging women to get vaccinated while pregnant.”

Previous studies looking at possible links between influenza during pregnancy and ASD had produced mixed results, Croen and her colleagues note in JAMA Pediatrics. And until now, they add, no studies had looked for links between ASD and flu vaccines, which are recommended for pregnant women.

People with ASD may have social, communication and behavioral challenges that may cause them to interact, learn and behave in ways different from most people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

A second study published in the same journal also found no link between vaccines against influenza A (H1N1) - sometimes referred to as swine flue - during pregnancy in 2009-2010 and complications later in life for over 60,000 Danish children.

The results support the overall safety profile of the vaccine, write the researchers, who were led by Anders Hviid, of the Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen. They support the World Health Organization’s recommendations that pregnant women should get a flu vaccine.

While the CDC recommends that everyone over 6 months of age receive a flu vaccine, it’s especially important for some people - including pregnant women - who are more likely to experience complications from the virus.

“The flu in pregnancy is dangerous,” said Dr. Loralei Thornburg, a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. “We know that women who have the flu do much worse and we know their babies do worse.”

Pregnant women with influenza may be at an increased risk for premature labor and delivery, according to the CDC. There is also a greater risk of birth defects in their babies.

“There have been a lot of fears about vaccines, but the data suggest they are effective and don’t increase the risk of autism and other perinatal complications,” said Thornburg, who was not involved with the new studies. “The benefits strongly outweigh any risks or theoretical risks that we’ve seen.”",mainstream,M0abc2,vaccine.autism

Amid a rout that has sent global stocks and oil prices lower, three pharmaceutical companies saw outsize gains on Monday because of China's coronavirus outbreak.

Shares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Moderna, and Novavax surged as the Wuhan coronavirus spread further. The companies continued rallies that were sparked on Thursday when the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a public-private nonprofit based in Norway, announced that it would provide as much as $11 million in funding to Inovio and Moderna to develop vaccines against the coronavirus.

The University of Queensland in Australia is also working on a vaccine for the coronavirus and received funding from the coalition.

As of Monday, the virus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, had killed at least 81 people and infected more than 2,700 others amid fears of a global outbreak. There are no vaccines or treatments for the virus, officially called 2019-nCoV. It's similar to the virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which incited global panic during a 2003 outbreak.

While some of the experimental vaccines the pharma companies are working on to target the Wuhan virus could be ready for human testing in a few months, approval for widespread use will take much longer, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.

Myth: I got all my vaccines as a child, so I’m done with those shots. Not so. “The immunity we get from vaccinations wanes over time,” says pediatrician Danelle Fisher, MD, of Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. You may also have missed a dose of a vaccine as a child or were given an older, weaker version. “If you can’t remember when you got your last vaccinations and were a baby or young child, talk to your doctor,” Fisher says. “It might be a great time to get a booster.”

Myth: I can’t get the flu vaccine because I’m allergic to eggs. Yes, you can! There are egg-free versions of the flu vaccine for people 18 and older. Ask for them. If that’s not available or you’re too young for the egg-free vaccine, and you’ve ever only had a mild reaction to eggs (such as hives), you can get the regular vaccine and just be monitored more closely afterward.

You never outgrow the need for a yearly flu vaccine. Plus, there are other vaccines that grown-ups need, including:
• The shingles vaccine, which is recommended for adults 60 and older.
• The two pneumococcal vaccines, which are recommended for people 65 and older. (People with certain medical conditions should get them earlier.) You should also keep up with any boosters you need for protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough (pertussis). Remember, with whooping cough, anyone who’s going to be around babies or young kids should get vaccinated to help protect those children.

Vaccines don’t have many other ingredients besides antigens. For instance, tiny amounts of formaldehyde and thimerosal (a preservative that has mercury in it) can be used to kill the virus when it’s being made. Aluminum is also sometimes used to help the vaccine work better. “The amount [of these ingredients] is very small compared to what we expose ourselves to on a regular basis,” Fisher says. And there is no evidence these trace amounts build up in your body or cause problems down the road.",mainstream,M086e4,vaccine

1079,"A person with coronavirus (COVID-19) or suspected to have it must enter mandatory isolation.

Isolation is different from quarantine and physical distancing.

Who must go into isolation

You will need to isolate to prevent the spread of the virus to others if:

You will need to isolate in:
• hospital if you need hospital care
• your home if it is suitable
• another location if needed as decided by your public health authority

The public health authority will advise you when you can leave.

Steps you need to take while in isolation

If you are not at home when you find out you have COVID-19, you must go straight home. You cannot stop anywhere, not even to buy medicine or groceries. Where possible, use personal transport such as a private car.

You must stay isolated until your public health authority advises you are safe to leave. If you leave isolation without permission you may face criminal charges or a fine.
• must not leave your home except in an emergency or to get essential medical care
• must not go into public places including work and shops
• must not let any other person into your home unless the person
• lives with you and cannot live somewhere else
• is providing medical care for you
• is entering for an emergency

You should tell your public health unit before leaving your house if possible. If you leave, you must wear a mask.

If you live in a house, you may go into your garden or courtyard. You can go onto your balcony if you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel.

If you are in a hotel you must avoid contact with other guests and staff.

If your symptoms get worse phone your doctor. You should be on the lookout for high fevers or trouble breathing.

Keep in contact with your GP so they can monitor your health.

If you are having serious symptoms you should call 000 straight away. This includes shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or chest pressure or pain. Tell the ambulance staff you have COVID-19.

If you live alone, a friend or family member can ring you to check you are OK.

Living with other people while in isolation

If you share your home with others, you should limit your contact with them. Do this by:
• staying alone in your own room
• using a different bathroom, if possible
• wearing a mask when in the same room as others
• not being in the same room as other people, especially people at risk of severe disease (this includes elderly people and people with heart, lung, or kidney conditions and diabetes)
• frequently cleaning the house, especially things people touch often, like door handles
• cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze
• if you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve or elbow
• wash your hands straight away with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or

You should wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser if your hands are not visibly dirty.

Always do this:
• before entering an area where there are other people
• before touching things used by other people
• after using the bathroom
• before putting on, and after removing, gloves and masks.

Wear a mask when you are:
• in the same room as another person, even if they are also in isolation

Make sure your mask covers your nose and mouth at all times. Don’t touch your mask unnecessarily and replace it if it is wet.

You should not share items with people in your home if possible, including:

After using these items, wash them with soap and water or put them in a dishwasher or washing machine.

Steps other members of the household and caregivers can take to prevent infection

You should only share a house with a person with COVID-19 if:
• you are providing essential care to that person
• you cannot find a different place to live

People who stay in the same place as someone with COVID-19 will be a close contact and must follow quarantine rules. People should follow these rules for 14 days from when the person with COVID-19 was last infectious.

Wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser if your hands are not visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Always wash your hands before putting on and after taking off gloves and masks.
• you are in the same room as the person with COVID-19
• you touch or have contact with the person’s blood, body fluids and/or secretions
• make sure your mask covers your nose and mouth at all times
• throw out masks and gloves after use
• wash your hands immediately after taking off masks and gloves

If you are a caregiver or household member and develop a cold or flu-like symptoms you should call your GP or healthdirect. Tell them you are a close contact of someone with COVID-19.

If you become very unwell and it is a medical emergency call 000.

Clean all 'high-touch' surfaces at least once per day wearing water-proof disposable gloves. This includes:

You should also clean any surfaces that may have blood, body fluids and/or secretions on them.

Read labels of cleaning products and follow the instructions for use. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product. They also include precautions you should take when applying the product.

There are 2 options for cleaning something:
• a 2-step cleaning process, where you clean something with detergent and then disinfect it
• a 1-step process, where you use a combined detergent and disinfectant product.

The disinfectant you use should say on the label it is hospital-grade that kills viruses. You can also use a chlorine-based product such as bleach.

If you are cleaning something for another person who has COVID-19 you should:
• wash your hands immediately after removing gloves and masks
• wash laundry. Do not shake the laundry items before washing
• remove and wash clothes or bedding that has blood, body fluids and/or secretions on them
• read and follow the directions on laundry items and detergent. Wash and dry with the warmest temperatures recommended on the label
• wash dishes in a dishwasher where possible

Put gloves, masks, and other contaminated items in a lined waste bin before disposing of them with other household waste. Wash your hands immediately after handling these items.

How to get food and medication

You can get food and medication while in isolation in the following ways:
• Ask friends or family members you don’t live with to get food and medication to leave at your door. If you need a prescription filled arrange this with your usual pharmacist or GP. You can then let your friend or family member know where to go to collect the medication.
• Arrange a food delivery service. Have all food left outside your house. Do not let any delivery person into your home.
• If you need a prescription filled, you can arrange for your doctor to send your prescription to your pharmacy. They can then deliver it to your house. Read more about getting medicines and accessing health services.

Your Public health Unit will advise you when you are clear to end isolation and return to normal activities.

You must continue to practise physical distancing, and good hygiene.

If you become unwell and have any cold or flu like symptoms return home and contact your doctor.

Most interventions targeting patients’ thoughts and feelings have met with little success. But patients aren’t the only way to increase vaccination rate; providers wield significant influence over patient behavior: One study showed that 99% of patients accept the flu shot following a provider recommendation. But how do you motivate busy providers to vaccinate more of their patients? To address that question, the authors conducted a randomized controlled experiment to explore whether offering financial incentives or creating competition by informing clinics how their performance ranked relative to others had the biggest impact.

Last year, the World Health Organization ranked vaccine hesitancy, a “reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines,” among the top 10 health threats worldwide, alongside Ebola, H.I.V. and drug-resistant infections.

To state it bluntly, being unvaccinated can result in illness or death. Vaccines, in contrast, are extremely unlikely to lead to side effects, even minor ones like fainting.

As vaccination rates have fallen, highly contagious illnesses like measles have resurged globally. For instance, measles is now widespread in several European countries. In Samoa, a Pacific island nation of about 200,000 people, almost 5,700 measles cases have been recorded since September, resulting in at least 83 deaths. Almost all of those who died were young children.

One defendant, Luse Emo Tauvale, has admitted to three charges of obstruction of justice and two of negligence and manslaughter, while Leutogi Te’o has pleaded guilty to one charge of manslaughter.

Health Impact News reported on the original story in 2018 when it made headline news on TV1 in Samoa.

Tala Fou brings you breaking news on the death of two young children both aged 1-year-old from the villages of Safotu and Sasina in Savaii. Both children died within minutes of being vaccinated with the MMR vacine at Safotu Hospital on Friday morning the 6th of July. Our News Reporter Alisa Faamaoni met with both families in Savaii today. The parents of the first child Marietta and Samuelu Tuisuesue of Sasina explained in detail to Tala Fou that within three minutes of their 1-year-old daughter Lannacallystah Samuelu being injected with the MMR vacine by a nurse she was dead.
• CDC, check YOUR data, MMR rates are NOT declining

What was so tragic about this story was that the parents of the second child who died had reportedly already learned about the first infant’s death a couple hours earlier and declined to have their child receive the same vaccine.

The mother reported that the nurse administered the MMR vaccine against her consent, leading to the child’s immediate death upon receiving the vaccine.

The second family from Safotu is still coming to grips with the loss of their 1-year-old son Lameko Siu. The parents Punipuao and Si’u Timua arrived at the Safotu hospital with their son Lameko on Friday within two hours of the death of the first child once they became aware of what had happend the mother refused to allow her son to be vaccinated. The mother claims that the nurse on duty persisted and without her consent vaccinated her son administering the MMR vaccine and within a minute he was dead.

After the second death, government authorities immediately confiscated all the remaining doses of the MMR vaccine, and dismissed the medical staff, not only to apparently conduct an investigation, but for their own safety from an outraged public.

The Prime Minister of Samoa, Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, issued a statement about the tragic events and reported that, as a grandfather, one of his grandsons had previously suffered something similar, an apparent vaccine injury that he survived but now can no longer talk.

Death leaves a heartache no one can heal. And I can imagine that there is no pain more far reaching and deeper than losing a child. My heart and prayers go out to the grieving families at this most difficult time. To that effect, I humbly extend my deepest sympathy, condolences and pray that comfort and peace will come to them. As a grandfather and father, I can relate to the grief by the families for their loss. I also almost lost one of my grandsons several years ago under similar circumstances. But with the Grace of our Father in Heaven my grandson survived with the proper treatment but he will never be the same as he has lost the ability to speak. As Prime Minister, I have called a full inquiry into the circumstances leading up to this devastating incident which I do not take lightly. There are already processes that will determine if negligence is a factor. And if so, rest assured those processes will be implemented to the letter to ensure that such a tragedy will not be repeated and those responsible will be made to answer.

A Prime Example Why Informed Consent and Parental Rights are Important, and How Forced Vaccinations Endanger the Lives of Children

Vaccines carry serious risks, and even the U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged these risks by stating that vaccines are “Unavoidably unsafe.”

All across the U.S. pro-vaccine extremists are trying to eliminate vaccine exemptions and parental choice for vaccines.

A recent bill passed in Oregon even gave dentists the right to vaccinate children, as the vaccine extremists push the agenda of Big Pharma to try and vaccinate the entire public, regardless of whether or not some children are more susceptible to vaccine injuries than others.

And in California Senator Richard Pan wants California to be the first state in the U.S. to eliminate even the medical exemption for vaccines, where physicians can best determine whether their patients should receive every vaccine recommended by the CDC in the childhood vaccination schedule.

Pan wants the politicians, the state Department of Public Health, to approve any medical exemption to vaccines instead of medical doctors who provide medical services to California children, and their parents.

Of course when children die or are injured by vaccines in the United States, there is no media attention and public outcry like there was in Samoa. That’s because the U.S. is the only country in the world that has given the pharmaceutical industry immunity from legal consequences due to harm caused by vaccines.

772,"Latest on global search for coronavirus vaccine: 1st US candidate set for Phase 2; WHO tracks 8 efforts; Pfizer tests in humans

An unprecedented, all-out global race to develop a safe vaccine against the new coronavirus is underway. The stakes couldn't be higher, as public health officials and world leaders say an effective vaccine or treatment against the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 is necessary to fully restart economies and resume civic life.

As the pace accelerates, USA TODAY is rounding up some of the week's most notable vaccine developments. Here's what we know about the first U.S. candidate being tested on hundreds of volunteers, the eight potential vaccines being tracked by the World Health Organization, and the $8 million that's funding laboratories.

First US vaccine candidate cleared by FDA for Phase 2 of testing

The first U.S. SARS-CoV-2 trial vaccine has been cleared to go into Phase 2 testing by the Food and Drug Administration, Massachusetts-based Moderna announced Thursday. The vaccine candidate (a potential vaccine that could be used if found safe and effective) is called mRNA-1273 and was first given to volunteers in Seattle on March 16 as Phase 1 testing began.

FDA has completed its review of Moderna's Investigational New Drug application for mRNA-1273, which allows it to now proceed to Phase 2 study. Moderna expects such tests to begin “shortly,” it said in a news release.

Phase 2 testing is done with several hundred volunteers and looks to see how their immune systems respond to the vaccine and whether it makes them immune to the disease. Safety and side effects are also studied.

Moderna said it is finalizing the protocol for Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273. Those tests are expected to begin in early summer.

Phase 3 trials involve giving a vaccine to large numbers of people to see whether it works, whether it is safe and whether it has unknown or rare side effects. These can range from the thousands to the tens of thousands of volunteers.

Consider this: To find a coronavirus vaccine, can we ethically infect people with a disease with no cure?

WHO is tracking 8 vaccines in clinical evaluation

As of Wednesday, the World Health Organization was tracking eight potential vaccines for COVID-19 (called candidate vaccines) in clinical evaluation. These included four from China, one from England, two from the United States and one from the European Union.

The list also includes 100 candidate vaccines in preclinical evaluation, meaning they are still being tested in test tubes or in animals. The previous version of the list, published on April 20, included 5 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation and 71 in preclinical evaluation.

New York-based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Monday began testing a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In its announcement, the company said it went from pre-clinical studies in test tubes and animals to injecting humans with a possible vaccine in less than four months.

The trials, which are taking place in the United States, are still Phase 1. These test whether a potential vaccine is safe, has side effects and produces the desired response from the body’s immune system. Vaccines must go through Phase 1, 2 and 3 testing before they can be licensed. Each phase involves larger numbers of volunteers.

Pfizer is working with German pharmaceutical company BioNTech on the candidate vaccine, dubbed BNT162. The company first tested it in Germany last month on 12 healthy adults. The companies say they plan to test the candidate vaccine on 360 healthy volunteers in the United States

BNT162 is a messenger RNA vaccine that instructs cells to make a specific piece of protein to match what’s on SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein. The hope is the protein pieces will cause the body to create antibodies that will stop the virus from being able to attach to and invade cells.

Scientists at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute plan to test a candidate vaccine on more than 6,000 people by the end of May. If it is effective and safe, they could have millions of doses ready in the fall.

The work is being done at the university’s Jenner Institute, named for Edward Jenner, the 18th-century British physician who pioneered the smallpox vaccination. Tests done in six rhesus macaque monkeys seemed to show the candidate vaccine was protective. Now Phase 1 human tests are beginning.

The university is partnering with the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to move forward with manufacturing should the candidate vaccine prove effective.

Both have agreed to operate on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, with only the costs of production and distribution being covered. Oxford University and its spin-out company Vaccitech, which jointly hold the rights to the technology used to develop the candidate vaccine, will receive no royalties during the pandemic, the university said.

In a video meeting on Monday hosted by the European Union, world leaders, nonprofits and celebrities pledged $8 billion to fund laboratories working to develop and produce a vaccine.

The money was for the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, or the ACT Accelerator, a collaboration between the World Health organization and governments, nonprofits and industry worldwide. It was launched April 24. They all pledged to work with and support the effort.

The collaboration’s mission statement said in part, “We know that as long as anyone is at risk from this virus, the entire world is at risk – every single person on the planet needs to be protected from this disease.’

The United States was among the few countries not taking part in the fund-raising effort.

The three-hour event fundraising effort on Monday was something like an old-fashioned telethon, with a leader from each country taking a few minutes on the video call to pledge money for the ACTS Accelerator.

1122,"Dr. Stephen Thomas, who helped develop vaccine candidates for diseases such as Ebola, Zika and MERS, discusses the challenges involved in accelerating development during a pandemic.

When I served in the U.S. Army as a physician-scientist, I was assigned to Thailand, and there is one patient I remember vividly. He was only about 8 years old, lived on a farm in the northern part of the country, and was in the hospital with a serious brain infection. His infection was caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which he’d caught from a mosquito. If he survived, he was destined to live his life with severe and debilitating neurologic abnormalities. Even worse – this tragedy could have been avoided. Thailand had a safe and effective JEV vaccine and worked extremely hard to routinely immunize all its children, but this child had been missed.

The heartbreaking situation reminded me what my friend and mentor, Dr. Bruce Innis, told me as I embarked on a career in vaccine development, “Vaccines don’t save lives, vaccination saves lives.” He should know, Dr. Innis has helped successfully develop more than 15 vaccines, including the JEV vaccine licensed in the U.S.

Developing vaccines is a complex process driven by the fundamentals of biology, biomanufacturing and engineering, and innovation. Vaccine concepts are explored, and prototypes first tested in the lab. Scientists then test the safety of the vaccine on animals and, if results are promising, clinical trials involving people begin. It can take years to develop a vaccine, and something that works well in the lab may not fare as well in people. We need to keep this long, complicated, uncertain process in mind as we hear news emerge about vaccine candidates for the Covid-19 pandemic.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviews and decides whether a vaccine candidate is suitable for experimentation in humans. Although the agency does consider the results of animal studies, much of its review focuses on how the vaccine is manufactured, and whether the process is scalable. Manufacturing at scale (hundreds of millions of doses) is important because it is not enough to demonstrate a vaccine is safe and has clinical benefit, you need a system in place to make sure the vaccine is accessible, and people are actually vaccinated.

The entire process can take up to ten years, sometimes longer, and can cost up to a billion U.S. dollars, sometimes more. Even in times of a public health emergency it is difficult to advance a vaccine from concept to the marketplace. I played key roles in developing candidate vaccines for Ebola, MERS-CoV, and Zika, and despite the human suffering caused by these diseases, despite their international focus, and despite considerable investment from governments and the pharmaceutical industry, only one of those vaccines (Ebola) has been licensed.

The World Health Organization (WHO) attempts to expedite global vaccine development efforts by facilitating coordination and communication, using tools like their ‘vaccine pipeline tracker.’ In an unfortunate but recurring pattern, numerous vaccine candidates always populate the tracker initially as outbreaks unfold and the money flows but, invariably, developers move on and drop off as resources and interest dries up. It is unclear how the WHO’s role and influence will change if the U.S. severs ties and withdraws its people and funding from Geneva.

Many developers with promising vaccine candidates become permanently stalled in their development process because they cannot afford the costs of required testing. Others experience significant bottlenecks when trying to access the limited biomanufacturing facilities specialized in producing vaccines suitable for human use. Even large pharmaceutical companies with generous financial coffers and in-house capabilities face sizeable opportunity costs by pursuing epidemic outbreak projects. They are forced to borrow staff and other resources from current projects to support new development teams, thereby stalling ongoing projects and the introduction of vaccines against other human diseases.

Facing such programmatic headwinds, how is the U.S. government going to execute its Covid-19 vaccine development plan, Operation Warp Speed? Compared to the U.S. government responses for Ebola, MERS, and Zika, many elements of the operation are status quo, especially in the areas of development and manufacturing. The Covid-19 vaccine effort, however, looks to employ new approaches in the hopes of reducing project timelines. For example, utilizing the Department of Defense to deploy, distribute, and administer vaccines could support the rapid immunization of sizable populations.

Another new approach is the expanded role of the federal government in the private-public partnerships that have defined the Covid-19 vaccine development space. Operation Warp Speed directs that the federal government will decide on the vaccine development pathways and the pharmaceutical companies will not, “…decide on their own protocols.”

The successful past performance of private-public partnerships in vaccine development leave me very encouraged for the prospect of a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine. My expectations are measured and cautious, however, given the difficult realities of public-private coordination, risk sharing, and industry finding the balance between meeting public health needs and revenue goals. As with any ambitious and audacious plan, the devil is in the highly complex details.

There is no doubt the federal government has numerous very experienced vaccine developers, and it was my privilege to work with many of them during my Army career and I continue to do so today. But vaccine development involves numerous teams working together and requires close coordination, not only between government agencies (this is hard enough), but with Congress and the academic and private sectors.

Achieving harmony in these relationships has been difficult in the past because the mission scope and incentives for the government and the private sector are different in many important ways. John Young, Pfizer’s chief business officer, was recently quoted saying Pfizer would not seeking government funding (even after they were selected by U.S. government as a finalist for funding) because their focus was speed and they, “…didn't want to … spend a month negotiating with the U.S. government.”

The government is focused on protecting the Nation and its citizens. The pharmaceutical industry cares greatly about public health, but also answers to shareholders. Committing millions of dollars to high-risk ventures is a daily occurrence in the life science industries but that risk is carefully calculated, as is the financial upside. In some cases, such as with Merck’s Ebola and GSK’s malaria vaccines, companies embark on development projects despite understanding there will be financial losses, but these situations are the exception. How will industry manage the risks and costs of developing a Covid-19 vaccine, while relinquishing considerable developmental command and control to the government?

Why does it matter who controls the development plan? Because they determine how the vaccine will ultimately be used and by whom, thereby defining the market. If protocol designs are restricted to meet U.S. or largely Western agendas, industry may lose out on accessing a global Covid-19 vaccine market, perhaps the biggest vaccine market, - which means billions would be left without a vaccine and industry would be left without a good way to recoup its investment.

There is also the issue of who will own the intellectual property (IP) generated during the collaboration. IP protections are major drivers of revenue streams and recovery of research and development investments. Members of Congress are already waging war on drug and other pharmaceutical pricing and profits. More than a few members wish to also revamp provisions in U.S. Code, like the Bayh-Dole Act, to limit industry’s exclusive rights to IP developed using U.S. taxpayer dollars.

The government may contend, some say rightly, that if U.S. taxpayers are paying the development bill, the U.S. must be guaranteed an immediate return on its investment - such as preferential vaccine access and/or pricing. But this concept of “America first,” is not playing well. Paul Hudson, the CEO of French vaccine juggernaut Sanofi Pasteur, was quickly corrected by the French government when he implied the U.S. may be entitled to preferential Covid-19 vaccine access due to its financial investment.

Heads of prominent non-governmental organizations, governments, and industry convened this spring to discuss the topic of vaccine access and the result, expressed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, was that, “Countries, health partners, manufacturers, and the private sector must act together and ensure that the fruits of science and research can benefit everybody.”

Once a vaccine is available, manufacturing and distribution activities will need to be sustained and licenses and certifications maintained long after the U.S. government has moved on to the next problem. These activities represent millions of dollars in expenditures every year. The pharmaceutical industry executes these tasks on a routine basis but without the financial upside of global market access and IP rights, how will they be incentivized? Many companies jump into the vaccine development pool during epidemics and pandemics because it is the right thing to do for public health. But few possess, or tolerate, the required financial staying power to see the project to completion.

My experience leaves me little doubt that developing a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine is feasible. The unprecedented scope of coordination between, and among, U.S. government agencies and industry is reassuring that the process can move fast, maybe even approach very fast, but that’s slightly slower than warp speed.

Last week it was reported that the government identified five companies it believes have the highest likelihood of delivering a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine, including Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Pfizer. But numerous questions remain about how the relationship between the development partners will continue to be mutually beneficial long enough to not only realize the development of a vaccine but to witness lives saved through vaccination.

275,"Originally published at McClatchy Newspapers by Greg Gordon on 5/20/11

WASHINGTON — Buried in FBI laboratory reports about the anthrax attacks that killed five people in 2001 is data suggesting that a chemical may have been added to try to heighten the powder’s potency, a move that some experts say exceeded the expertise of the presumed killer.

The lab data, contained in more than 9,000 pages of files that emerged a year after the Justice Department closed its inquiry and condemned the late Army microbiologist Bruce Ivins as the perpetrator, shows unusual levels of silicon and tin in anthrax powder from two of the five letters.

Those elements are found in compounds that could be used to weaponize the anthrax, enabling the lethal spores to float easily so they could be readily inhaled by the intended victims, scientists say.

The existence of the silicon-tin chemical signature offered investigators the possibility of tracing purchases of the more than 100 such chemical products available before the attacks, which might have produced hard evidence against Ivins or led the agency to the real culprit.

More at The Real News

But the FBI lab reports released in late February give no hint that bureau agents tried to find the buyers of additives such as tin-catalyzed silicone polymers.

The apparent failure of the FBI to pursue this avenue of investigation raises the ominous possibility that the killer is still on the loose.

A McClatchy analysis of the records also shows that other key scientific questions were left unresolved and conflicting data wasn’t sorted out when the FBI declared Ivins the killer shortly after his July 29, 2008, suicide.

One chemist at a national laboratory told McClatchy that the tin-silicone findings and the contradictory data should prompt a new round of testing on the anthrax powder.

A senior federal law enforcement official, who was made available only on the condition of anonymity, said the FBI had ordered exhaustive tests on the possible sources of silicon in the anthrax and concluded that it wasn’t added. Instead, the lab found that it’s common for anthrax spores to incorporate environmental silicon and oxygen into their coatings as a “natural phenomenon” that doesn’t affect the spores’ behavior, the official said.

To arrive at that position, however, the FBI had to discount its own bulk testing results showing that silicon composed an extraordinary 10.8 percent of a sample from a mailing to the New York Post and as much as 1.8 percent of the anthrax from a letter sent to Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, far more than the occasional trace contamination. Tin — not usually seen in anthrax powder at all — was measured at 0.65 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, in those letters.

An FBI spokesman declined to comment on the presence of tin or to answer other questions about the silicon-tin connection.

Several scientists and former colleagues of Ivins argue that he was a career biologist who probably lacked the chemistry knowledge and skills to concoct a silicon-based additive.

“There’s no way that an individual scientist can invent a new way of making anthrax using silicon and tin,” said Stuart Jacobsen, a Texas-based analytical chemist for an electronics company who’s closely studied the FBI lab results. “It requires an institutional effort to do this, such as at a military lab.”

Martin Hugh-Jones, a world-renowned anthrax expert who teaches veterinary medicine at Louisiana State University, called it “just bizarre” that the labs found both tin — which can be toxic to bacteria such as anthrax during lab culturing — and silicon.

“You have two elements at abnormally high levels,” Hugh-Jones said. “That reduces your probability to a very small number that it’s an accident.”

The silicon-tin connection wasn’t the only lead left open in one of the biggest investigations in FBI history, an inquiry that took the bureau to the cutting edge of laboratory science. In April, McClatchy reported that after locking in on Ivins in 2007, the bureau stopped searching for a match to a unique genetic bacterial strain scientists had found in the anthrax that was mailed to the Post and to NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, although a senior bureau official had characterized it as the hottest clue to date.

FBI officials say it’s all a moot point, because they’re positive they got the right man in Ivins. A mentally troubled anthrax researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md., Ivins overdosed on drugs not long after learning that he’d soon face five counts of capital murder.

In ending the inquiry last year, the Justice Department said that a genetic fingerprint had pointed investigators to Ivins’ lab, and gumshoe investigative techniques enabled them to compile considerable circumstantial evidence that demonstrated his guilt.

Among these proofs, prosecutors cited Ivins’ alleged attempt to steer investigators away from a flask of anthrax in his lab that genetically matched the mailed powder — anthrax that had been shared with other researchers. They also noted his anger over a looming congressional cut in funds for his research on a new anthrax vaccine.

However, the FBI never found hard evidence that Ivins produced the anthrax or that he scrawled threatening letters seemingly meant to resemble those of Islamic terrorists. Or that he secretly took late-night drives to Princeton, N.J., to mail them.

The FBI declared Ivins the killer soon after paying $5.8 million to settle a suit filed by another former USAMRIID researcher, Steven Hatfill, whom the agency mistakenly had targeted earlier in its investigation.

Anthrax is one of the deadliest and most feared biological weapons. Once inhaled, microscopic anthrax spores germinate into rapidly multiplying, highly toxic bacteria that attack human tissue. The resulting illnesses are lethal within days if untreated.

The letters, mailed just weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, not only went to the New York Post, Leahy and Brokaw, but also to American Media Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., and to Democratic then-Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota. Five people died, 17 were sickened and about 31,000 were forced to take powerful antibiotics for weeks. Crews wearing moon suits spent several weeks eradicating the spores from a Senate office building and a central Postal Service facility in Washington.

The FBI guarded its laboratory’s finding of 10.8 percent silicon in the Post letter for years. New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler asked FBI Director Robert Mueller how much silicon was in the Post and Leahy letters at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee in September 2008. The Justice Department responded seven months later that silicon made up 1.4 percent of the Leahy powder (without disclosing the 1.8 percent reading) and that “a reliable quantitative measurement was not possible” for the Post letter.

The bureau’s conclusions that silicon was absorbed naturally drew a gentle challenge in February from a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, which evaluated the investigation’s lab work.

While finding no evidence that silicon had been added to the mailed anthrax, the panel noted deep in its report that the FBI had provided “no compelling explanation” for conflicts in silicon test results between the Sandia National Laboratories and its own lab.

Sandia — which used electron microscopes, unlike the FBI — reported only a tenth as much silicon in the New York Post letter as the bureau’s lab did. Sandia said it was all embedded in the spore coatings, where it wasn’t harmful.

The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ran a third set of tests and found pockets of heavy silica concentrations, but it couldn’t say whether they were inside or outside the spores.

Jacobsen, the Texas chemist, suspects that the silica pockets represented excess material that went through a chemical reaction and hardened before it could penetrate the spores.

The National Academy of Sciences panel wrote that the varying composition of the powder might have accounted for the differing findings.

While finding no evidence that silicon was added, the panel said it “cannot rule out the intentional addition of a silicon-based substance … in a failed attempt to enhance dispersion” of the New York Post powder.

Tufts University chemistry professor David Walt, who led the panel’s analysis of the silicon issue, said in a phone interview that “there was not enough silicon in the spores that could account for the total silicon content of the bulk analysis.”

He said it was unclear whether the “trace” levels of tin were significant.

During the FBI’s seven-year hunt, the Department of Homeland Security commissioned a team of chemists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to grow anthrax-like spores under varying conditions to see how much silicon would end up naturally in the final product.

They found little, if any, silicon in most cases, far less than was in the New York Post letter, said Stephan Velsko, one of the two researchers. He called the tin readings from the FBI’s anthrax data “baffling.”

Peter Weber, Velsko’s co-researcher, said the academy panel’s focus on the conflicting data “raises a big question,” and “it’d be really helpful for closure of this case if that was resolved.”

He suggested that further “micro-analysis” with a highly sophisticated electron microscope could “pop the question marks really quickly.”

In a chapter in a recently updated book, “Microbial Forensics,” Velsko wrote that the anthrax “must have indeed been produced under an unusual set of conditions” to create such high silicon counts. That scenario, he cautioned, might not be “consistent with the prosecution narrative in this case.”

About 100 tin-catalyzed silicone products are on the market, and an even wider array was available in 2000 and 2001, before the mailings, said Richie Ashburn, a vice president of one manufacturer, Silicones Inc., in High Point, N.C.

Mike Wilson, a chemist for another silicone products maker, SiVance, in Gainesville, Fla., said that numerous silicon products could be used to make spores or other particles water-repellent. He also said that the ratios of silicon to tin found in the Post and Leahy samples would be “about right” if a tin-catalyzed silicone had been added to the spores.

Jacobsen, a Scottish-born and -educated chemist who once experimented with silicon coatings on dust particles, said he got interested in the spore chemistry after hearing rumors in late 2001 that a U.S. military facility had made the killer potions. He called it “outrageous” that the scientific issues haven’t been addressed.

“America, the most advanced country in the world, and the FBI have every resource available to them,” he said. “And yet they have no compelling explanation for not properly analyzing the biggest forensic clue in the most important investigation the FBI labs had ever gotten in their history.”

As a result of Ivins’ death and the unanswered scientific issues, Congress’ investigative arm, the Government Accountability Office, is investigating the FBI’s handling of the anthrax inquiry.",conspiracy,C010c4,vaccine
1289,"Oprah Winfrey recently appeared on the Ellen show talking about her recent bout with pneumonia, a relatively common, albeit potentially quite dangerous, infection of the lungs. She described how she had initially thought it was just a cold. But her unrelenting symptoms of coughing and 'chest rattling' led her first to an emergency room, and then to a lung specialist. Thankfully, Oprah is better now. And thankfully, she received excellent care, including close monitoring, antibiotics, and likely inhalers as well. In her chat with Ellen, she voices the importance of getting flu shots and pneumonia shots.

For those of us in healthcare, this is not radically new information. We are just entering this year's flu season, already having seen at least one child die from the flu. The flu shot is recommended to all people ages 6 months and older. Every year. Period. But what about the pneumonia shot? That one doesn't usually make it to the headlines. Until Oprah had pneumonia, that is. The pneumonia vaccine is not actually a vaccine that prevents pneumonia per se, as pneumonia can be caused by a multitude of viruses and bacteria. But it does prevent infection from 13 to 23 types of the bacteria pneumococcus, a powerful organism that can knock anybody for a loop. The PCV13 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13) is recommended to infants and children, and adults ages 65 years and older; the PCV23 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 23) is recommended to children ages two years and older, and adults ages 65 and over who are at risk for pneumonia, or have a chronic illness.

Oprah just turned 65 this past January. While she hasn't proclaimed whether or not she's had the PCV13, the PCV23, or neither, nor whether or not she's had the flu shot, she does have a history of supporting other celebrities most known to physicians as vocal anti-vaxxers. Perhaps most notorious is Oprah's promotion of Jenny McCarthy back in 2007, whereby she gave McCarthy a platform on her talk show to talk about how her son's autism symptoms were triggered by his receiving the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Ms. McCarthy has been one of the loudest celebrity voices of the antivaxx movement, which only continues to thrive today.

Because of the inaccuracies and downright falsehoods in linking MMR vaccines to autism, the critical number of children receiving this vaccine in the United States has dropped to such a low number that there continue to be measles outbreaks nearly weekly. In August 2019, the United Kingdom lost its ""measles free"" status according to the WHO, and the U.S. is not far behind.

Celebrity endorsements regarding wellness products, weight loss regimes, and health maintenance are nothing new, but continue to carry more power than most doctors, nurses, or even health organizations can claim. Perhaps a shout out for shots by one of the most powerful voices in the media will change some vaccine-hesitant minds this season. Or perhaps it wont.",mainstream,M074cc,vaccine.autism
1241,"ISLAMABAD - Pakistan announced Friday that it would begin “within weeks” production and export of the antiviral drug remdesivir for treating COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

As of Friday afternoon EDT, according to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the pandemic had killed more than 306,000 people and infected more than 4.5 million worldwide since late in 2019, when it struck first in China.

Zafar Mirza, Pakistan’s health minister, told reporters in Islamabad that a local pharmaceutical company, Ferozons Laboratories Ltd., would make the medicine in partnership with America’s Gilead, which developed remdesivir.

He noted that Pakistan would be one of only three countries to produce and export the drug.

""The manufacturing of the injectable medicine will start within six to eight weeks and it will be available not only for coronavirus patients in Pakistan, but it will also be exported to 127 countries,” Mirza said.

Regulators in America have allowed emergency use of remdesivir, which appeared to help some coronavirus patients recover faster in clinical trials.

The U.S. pharmaceutical company has also signed agreements with four drugmakers in neighboring India to help manufacture and supply the drug to those countries.

Under the “nonexclusive licensing” pacts with the South Asian partners, Gilead said, the companies all will have the ""right to receive a technology transfer of the Gilead manufacturing process for remdesivir to enable them to scale up their production quickly.”

Osman Khalid Waheed, the chief executive of the Pakistani pharmaceutical company, speaking alongside Mirza, said once production begins, the medicine will be exported to both developed and low-income nations.

“We are committed together with Gilead to produce the medicine at minimum cost and make it most accessible in the developing world,” Waheed said.

Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, has confirmed that more than 37,000 people have contracted the coronavirus and more than 800 of them have died since the country detected the outbreak nearly three months ago.

Prime Minister Imran Khan vowed Friday to further relax a nationwide partial lockdown, citing a relatively very low number of infections and deaths as opposed to the earlier official projections.

Khan defended his decision, saying while the virus-related situation remained under control, ""about 150 million individuals” across Pakistan, including daily wagers and laborers, could soon begin suffering from starvation because of the economic shutdown.

“Until a vaccine is available, the coronavirus will persist irrespective of a lockdown. Hence, we will have to learn to live with it until then,” he said.",mainstream,M079a9,drug.companies; vaccine.covid
254,"Mandatory Vaccination: Why We Still Got to Get Folks to Take Their Shots (2006 Third Year Paper)

Vaccination is widely considered one of the greatest medical achievements of modern civilization. Childhood diseases that were commonplace less than a generation ago are now increasingly rare because of vaccines. In order to be effective at eliminating communicable diseases, vaccines must be administered to sufficient levels of persons in the community. Because of this, public health officials have mandated vaccination for certain diseases as a condition to school attendance. The overwhelming effectiveness of vaccination programs may lead individuals to ignore the benefits of vaccination and focus more on the risk of side effects. Moreover, some have criticized the coercive nature of these programs. These objections may lead to an unacceptably high number of exemptions, which can compromise vaccination programs and leave the population susceptible to outbreaks. This paper explores vaccination programs with an eye toward greater public safety without ignoring the reality of a small but committed group of vaccine critics. The paper begins with a discussion of the historical development of mandatory vaccination policies and the issues posed by exemptions. It then addresses some of these issues in the context of vaccine safety. It also seeks solution by framing the discussion in economic terms. It concludes by recommending stricter enforcement of mandatory requirements for most vaccines and greater dissemination of information on the continued importance of vaccination.",mainstream,M093d9,vaccine
296,"Why Do We Still Vaccinate? – 25 Questions From A Former Vaccine Advocate

I used to be pro vaccine. I know the feeling of thinking others were just plain crazy and wrong for not vaccinating their children and themselves. ‘Irresponsible!’ I said when pointing my finger. I’d use the same old arguments about polio and small pox and how vaccines saved us from all those horrible diseases and just swallowing and regurgitating the propaganda I was brought up with. It was only recently, in 2009 that I started questioning my long held beliefs and began digging in to the history, efficacy and safety of vaccines. I was appalled at what I found and the recklessness of those government health agencies entrusted with our health and our children’s safety, and angry with myself that I had put my family’s health at risk by blind faith in others when I was ultimately responsible for the medical decisions of my family.

When I began to put this article together I specifically chose not to include research from or links to websites that are considered untrustworthy by most pro-vaxxers, sites such as Natural News, Mercola, etc. even though I personally trust those sites and much more than I would WebMd and for good reason [a]. Instead I chose to employ basic logic and also incorporate independent and .gov scientific studies-mostly peer review, journals, news from mainstream sources (that pro-vaxxers love and totally trust) and articles that link to other .gov scientific studies, as well as government statistical resources. So, I started writing down questions and then looking for answers. I’ll admit, some of these questions have already been asked by others, but I just expanded upon it to form a helpful list.



I hope the following information helps you in your lifelong journey in search of health, vitality and truth in your own lives and your children’s lives.

1. Why are newborn babies vaccinated on their first day of life against a disease that is primarily transmitted sexually and by needles in drug users?

 (Pregnant women are already tested for STD’s prior to birth so there’s no reason to give it to an infant). Interesting to note, of the few vaccines that still are given to infants and STILL has thimerasol in it is Hep B and DipTet (and Flu shot recommended to pregnant women). So, the claim that it has been removed from all vaccines is a lie and misdirection. If they give it to all newborns then ALL the newborns are getting that thimerasol (mercury derivative). “It was removed from many child vaccines in 2002 but remains in some vaccines (e.g., hepatitis B virus and)” Page 21.

2. Why are babies given vaccines to produce antibodies when they do not produce antibodies until after the age of 3 to 6 months?

 They get the required antibodies from breastfeeding.

3. Why does the government tell parents to delay breast feeding and get more vaccines when breast feeding babies produce higher levels of antibodies?

4. Why aren’t vaccine manufacturers held responsible when their product injures your child? Why would these companies need to be protected from the effects of such wonderful products?

 (Look into Vaccine Injury Compensation Program .gov and VAERS)

 The Supreme Court ruling exempting the vaccine manufacturers from all liability is done under the explicit understanding that they fall under the category “unavoidably unsafe products.”

5. Why have no double blind, placebo, randomized controlled trials been done on any vaccines?

 This is standard with any other drug.

6. Why are we following the US vaccination schedule? We are the most vaccinated population on the planet with the highest rates of infant deaths/SIDS in the western world?

9. Why are we frightened of non-fatal illnesses that train a child’s immune system how to behave?

10. Why are vaccine manufacturers allowed to reduce antigens and insert cheap and toxic additives that aggravate the injection site?

11. Why do we need multi-dose vaccines if the number ONE priority of vaccine manufacturers is your child’s safety?

12. Why will no physician sign a written guarantee for a child’s safety prior to vaccinating them with products they insist you take and that they say are completely safe?

13. Why is there no outrage about the 3.1 billion dollars paid out in vaccine injury/death claims and yet they claim there is no correlation and they are perfectly safe? 

 http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreport.pdf

14. Why don’t people recognize from history that the most widespread and lethal diseases in the last 200 years were reduced due to cleaner drinking water, improved sanitation, nutrition, less overcrowded areas and better living conditions? 

 Vaccines were introduced at points in time where every single disease was already declining, most almost completely gone. To give vaccines credit for global reductions in disease is like giving a band-aid credit for healing a wound that was already closing. Dr. Hans Rosling shows exactly how the health condition of nearly all countries of the world have improved with wealth, even 200 years ago, at the times where there no vaccines.

By the late 1950s, even before the introduction of measles vaccine, measles-related deaths and case fatality rates in the United States had decreased markedly, presumably as a result of improvement in health care and nutrition (Oxford Journal of Infectious Diseases).

15. Why do people keep parroting what they hear about ‘Herd Immunity?’

 Herd immunity is a hilarious concept that assumes that 1) Vaccinated people are immune to the diseases for which they’ve been vaccinated, 2) Can not carry the diseases for which they are vaccinated/immune, 3) Because most of the people are vaccinated, other people around them can’t catch the disease. My favourite analogy for herd immunity is that if 95% of people in a building are wearing hard hats when the ceiling falls in, the 5% are protected. (credit Dr. Robert Murdoch)

16. Why are almost all pro-vaxxer adults we talk to not up to date on their adult vaccinations/boosters?

18. Why didn’t our government health agencies ever safety test thimerasol (a mercury derivative and adjuvant) since Lilly developed it in the 1920’s?

 They used it in vaccines from 1930 to 2004! It still is in some vaccines such as the flu vaccine and others. Here is a 2 minute clip, from Congressional Hearings. The EPA themselves acknowledge the toxic effects of mercury:

19. Why is it that only 40% of health professionals receive the flu shot each year? They must not believe in it.

 http://abcnews.go.com…

20. Why? Instead of a mandatory vaccine law, why don’t they have a mandatory law passed to protect us from Iatrogenic Death? (Death by Doctor, 3rd leading cause of death!)

 http://articles.mercola.com…

 http://www.worldlawdirect.com…

 

 21. Why doesn’t the pro vaccination public admit that the vaccinated spread disease and stop blaming us?

 http://www.cnbc.com/id/102473744

 http://www.nc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/5/00-0512_article



 22. Why do people still trust their government health agencies when they say vaccines are perfectly safe? 

 With all the big pharma fraud cases, Merck, Glaxo Smith Kline, etc. and all the class action suits that come out several times a year for death/injury you see on tv commercials every week, combine that with the VICP and VAERS .gov statistics, and Iatrogenic Death statistics, why do people still trust their government health agencies when they say vaccines are perfectly safe? Having said that, why is government trusted at all since Democide statistics (death by government) show that nearly 300 million in this last century were killed by the state. Those are non-combatants.

Review is made of 107 cases of neurological complications of pertussis inoculation reported in the literature. The early onset of neurological symptoms was characteristic, with changes of consciousness and convulsions as the most striking features. The question of aetiology is considered and contraindications are discussed…as is the grave danger of further inoculations when a previous one has produced any suggestion of a neurological reaction.

Aluminum Studies:

 – Do aluminum vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence ofautism?

 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099159

“…A second series of experiments was conducted on mice injected with six doses of aluminum hydroxide. Behavioural analyses in these mice revealed significant impairments in a number of motor functions as well as diminished spatial memory capacity.”

Experimental research, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. click for entire study

– Integrating experimental (in vitro and in vivo) neurotoxicity studies of low-dose thimerosal relevant to vaccines.

 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21350943

There is a need to interpret neurotoxic studies to help deal with uncertainties surrounding pregnant mothers, newborns and young children who must receive repeated doses of Thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs).

Information extracted from studies indicates that: (a) activity of low doses of Thimerosal against isolated human and animal brain cells was found in all studies and is consistent with Hg neurotoxicity; (b) the neurotoxic effect of ethylmercury has not been studied with co-occurring adjuvant-Al in TCVs; (c) animal studies have shown that exposure to Thimerosal-Hg can lead to accumulation of inorganic Hg in brain, and that (d) doses relevant to TCV exposure possess the potential to affect human neuro-development.

– Administration of thimerosal to infant rats increases overflow of glutamate and aspartate in the prefrontal cortex: protective role ofdehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.

 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22015977

Thimerosal, a mercury-containing vaccine preservative, is a suspected factor in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. We previously showed that its administration to infant rats causes behavioral, neurochemical and neuropathological abnormalities similar to those present in autism.

The ACIP’s recommendation of influenza vaccination during pregnancy is not supported by citations in its own policy paper or in current medical literature. Considering the potential risks of maternal and fetal mercury exposure, the administration of thimerosal during pregnancy is both unjustified and unwise. Also, take note of the 71 references at the end of this study.

31,"Vaccinations save lives, protect our children and are one of our greatest public health achievements. As public health officials, our role is to advance the health of the American people. This must include championing vaccinations.

Diseases like polio, measles, diphtheria and rubella were once common in the United States, afflicting hundreds of thousands of infants, children and adults, and killing thousands each year. Some older Americans may remember the fear associated with polio outbreaks and the era of iron lungs and leg braces — a time when swimming pools and movie theaters closed over concerns about the spread of the crippling disease. Others may recall the heartbreaking wave of rubella in the 1960s that resulted in thousands of newborn deaths, with thousands more born blind, deaf or with other lifelong disabilities.

We cannot let America be faced with these fears again. For those of us who have treated critically ill children with vaccine-preventable diseases, we know firsthand the devastation to the child — and to the family and community — of a death, limb amputation or severe brain damage that could have been avoided by a simple vaccination.

Modern vaccines are highly effective and safe, with most serious side effects being exceptionally rare — and much less serious than contracting the actual disease. But misinformation about vaccines is still widely reported, so we feel it is crucial to state clearly and unambiguously: Vaccines do not cause autism and they do not contain toxic chemicals. That fact was demonstrated again this week in a new study on MMR vaccination by Danish researchers.",mainstream,M093cc,vaccine.autism
1158,"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is seeking to create a vaccine that, theoretically, would protect people from most flu strains with a single shot of a universal vaccine. Senator Ed Markey introduced a bill that would funnel no less than a billion tax dollars toward the project. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases researchers are working on a DNA vaccine that, instead of injecting a piece of virus into a person to stimulate an immune response, would inject synthesized genes. [No matter what the promoters (who will be given the money) say, if genes are edited, deleted, or added, there inevitably will be unintended consequences. These unintended traits can never be removed from the human gene pool. Once monsters are created – even accidentally – they will be with us forever.] -GEG

Children’s Health Defense Note: CHD has internal documents in which the FDA acknowledges that technology that allows for the creation of these new vaccines has outpaced their ability to predict adverse events. Shouldn’t our federal agencies be calling for a moratorium until we have that knowledge—especially since it is heavily reported that the CDC/FDA post-marketing surveillance systems are inadequate to pick up problems after licensure?

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has launched efforts to create a vaccine that would protect people from most flu strains, all at once, with a single shot.

Over the years, I’ve written many articles refuting claims that vaccines are safe and effective, but we’ll put all that aside for the moment and follow the bouncing ball.

Massachusetts Senator and big spender, Ed Markey, has introduced a bill that would shovel no less than a billion dollars toward the universal flu-vaccine project.

Here is a sentence from an NIAID press release that mentions one of several research approaches:

“NIAID Vaccine Research Center scientists have initiated Phase 1/2 studies of a universal flu vaccine strategy that includes an investigational DNA-based vaccine (called a DNA ‘prime’)…”

This is quite troubling, if you know what the phrase “DNA vaccine” means. It refers to what the experts are touting as the next generation of immunizations.

Instead of injecting a piece of a virus into a person, in order to stimulate the immune system, synthesized genes would be shot into the body. This isn’t traditional vaccination anymore. It’s gene therapy.

In any such method, where genes are edited, deleted, added, no matter what the pros say, there are always “unintended consequences,” to use their polite phrase. The ripple effects scramble the genetic structure in numerous unknown ways.

This is genetic roulette with a loaded gun. Anyone and everyone on Earth injected with a DNA vaccine will undergo permanent and unknown genetic changes…

Here is the inconvenient truth about DNA vaccines—

They will permanently alter your DNA.

The reference is the New York Times, 3/15/15, “Protection Without a Vaccine.” It describes the frontier of research—the use of synthetic genes to “protect against disease,” while changing the genetic makeup of humans. This is not science fiction:

“By delivering synthetic genes into the muscles of the [experimental] monkeys, the scientists are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.”

“’The sky’s the limit,’ said Michael Farzan, an immunologist at Scripps and lead author of the new study.”

“The first human trial based on this strategy — called immunoprophylaxis by gene transfer, or I.G.T. — is underway, and several new ones are planned.” [That was three years ago.]

“I.G.T. is altogether different from traditional vaccination. It is instead a form of gene therapy. Scientists isolate the genes that produce powerful antibodies against certain diseases and then synthesize artificial versions. The genes are placed into viruses and injected into human tissue, usually muscle.”

Here is the punchline:

Read that again: “the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient’s own DNA.”",conspiracy,C00f96,vaccine.covid
1062,"The celebrations soon subsided though as heavy criticism came from the scientific community on the lack of details supplied on the study.

But was there good reason for so much enthusiasm? Several vaccine experts asked by STAT concluded that, based on the information made available by the Cambridge, Mass.-based company, there’s really no way to know how impressive — or not — the vaccine may be. While Moderna blitzed the media, it revealed very little information — and most of what it did disclose were words, not data. That’s important: If you ask scientists to read a journal article, they will scour data tables, not corporate statements. With science, numbers speak much louder than words.[2]

But another vital point which the press release failed to emphasize was the large number of serious injuries caused by the vaccine in the clinical trials. 3 of the 15 subjects[1] in the high dose cohort (250 mcg) suffered a “serious adverse event” within 43 days of receiving Moderna’s jab. Thats 20% of the subjects.

The press release stated that the three volunteers developed Grade 3 systemic events, which is defined by the FDA as “Preventing daily activity and requiring medical intervention.”[3]

The excitement really was all down to 8 of the volunteers producing neutralizing antibodies for the virus, which out of 45 people really is not overly impressive anyway. But lets pretend that is impressive for a moment, this stage in producing a coronavirus vaccine has never been the issue, the biggest hurdle to overcome is what happens when a subject comes into contact with the virus itself.

665,"Michelle Obama Helped Raise $55 Million for WHO Days After Trump Cut Funding

Obama, along with former First Lady Laura Bush, joined in to help raise funds

Former First Lady Michelle Obama is taking full political advantage of the coronavirus pandemic by helping raise $55 Million for the communist China-linked World Health Organization (WHO), days after Trump cut its funding.

Despite WHO being accused of covering up for China on the severity of the coronavirus and putting the entire world at risk, Michelle Obama decided the UN global body might need some help.

Obama, along with former first lady, Laura Bush, joined in to help raise funds for Global Citizen, the nongovernmental organization that launched the “Together at Home” virtual concert last week.

“Following One World: Together At Home, a historic global broadcasting event, Global Citizen together with Lady Gaga, announced $127 million in commitments to date in support of health care workers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.""

An eye-watering $55.1 million was set to go to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO, with $72.8 million allocated for “local and regional responders.”

“World leaders, corporate partners, and philanthropists announced their support for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO, powered by the UN Foundation, during the One World: Together At Home global broadcast event. Donations to the fund will also support the vaccine development alliance Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and UNICEF,” the release continued.

“The Together At Home effort will also aid over 100 additional local and regional charities that will also receive funds, including Education, Cannot Wait, Direct Care, Feeding America, and United Way, among others.

""Changemakers, investors, and foundation leaders came together to contribute quickly to related efforts, like strengthening health care systems and investing in vaccine development.”

Here is the video featuring Michelle Obama and Laura Bush:

“We’ve had the profound privilege of getting to know you and your families. Your hopes, your struggles, and your triumphs,” Obama said.

“The coming days will not be easy, but this global family of ours is strong.

""We will continue to be here for one another, and we will get through this crisis together. Thank you.”

“The spirit and courage of the American people is most evident in times of crisis, and during this period of physical separation, we’ve never been closer,” Bush added.

""Not just in our great country, but tonight we stand with the people of the world.""

Meanwhile, three men from New York are suing the World Health Organization (WHO) for 'incalculable' damages over its response to the coronavirus pandemic.

They accuse the WHO of not reacting quickly enough to declare a pandemic, and also covering up for Communist China.

Additionally, US lawyers also launched an unprecedented lawsuit against China.

The landmark legal action, to sue the Chinese government for trillions of dollars over the coronavirus pandemic, accuses leaders of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) of negligence and an attempted cover-up of COVID-19.

The class-action lawsuit was filed in Florida and involved thousands of claimants from 40 countries, including Britain and the U.S.

As Neon Nettle reported earlier this month, an email released by Taiwan revealed the WHO also received a warning in December about the coronavirus outbreak in China but chose to ignore it,

The Taiwanese government says WHO ignored its inquiries about COVID-19, and they were denied adequate information to fight the coronavirus.

Michelle Obama's decision to help raise money for the global health body, which covered for the communist Chineses and put the entire world at risk, maybe a statement in opposing Trump.

Still, it also shows what side of the fence she is on.

1050,"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - The number of suspected cases of measles on the Pacific island of Samoa has more than doubled over the past week to 3,530, and deaths related to the outbreak rose to 48 from 20 a week ago, the country’s Ministry of Health said Sunday.

Samoa has become vulnerable to measles outbreaks as the number of people becoming immunized has declined with the World Health Organization (WHO) saying vaccine coverage is about 31%.

The government started a mandatory vaccination program Nov. 20 after declaring a state of emergency because of the outbreak. The health ministry said in its statement that 57,132 people have since been vaccinated.

Schools and universities have been closed and most public gatherings banned on the island state of 200,000, located south of the equator and half way between Hawaii and New Zealand.

Of the 48 deaths, 44 where among children younger than 4. Since Saturday, there have been 173 new cases of measles recorded and four people have died.

Neighboring New Zealand and a number of other countries and organizations, including the U.N. agency UNICEF, have delivered thousands of vaccines, medical supplies and have sent medical personnel to help with the outbreak.

Measles, a highly contagious virus that spreads easily through coughing and sneezing, has been reported also in other Pacific nations, including Tonga and Fiji, but there have been no reports of deaths and the countries have greater vaccination coverage.

Tonga’s ministry of health said in a statement late last week that there were 394 cases of suspected measles identified, but only eight people required hospitalization.

767,"Trump announces 'Operation Warp Speed,' says U.S. could have coronavirus vaccine by January

Likening it to the national push to build the atomic bomb during World War II, President Trump on Friday announced Operation Warp Speed, a government coordinating effort aimed at securing a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year.

""Operation Warp Speed, that means big and it means fast,"" Trump said from the White House Rose Garden. ""A massive scientific and industrial, logistic endeavor unlike anything our country has seen since the Manhattan Project.""

Its objective is to finish developing and then manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible.

""We'd love to see if we can do it prior to the end of the year,"" Trump said. ""I think we're going to have some very good results coming out very quickly.""

Vaccine ethics: To find a coronavirus vaccine, can we ethically infect people with a disease with no cure?

The presentation was short on details but noted the initiative is evaluating roughly 100 vaccine candidates from all over the world and has identified more than 14 believed to be the most promising. Officials are working to narrow the list still further.

""We have some really interesting choices to be made,"" Trump said.

The government is providing support and resources to safely expedite trials on those vaccine candidates, ""moving on at record, record, record speed,"" the President said.

Trump confirmed the United States will invest in manufacturing all of the top vaccine candidates before they're approved. Known as “at risk” production, the government will take on the financial costs, legal liability and clinical trial costs, with no guarantee of getting a usable vaccine.

""That means they better come up with a good vaccine,"" Trump said.

Such extraordinary steps will allow the United States to have vaccine ready as soon as a specific candidate is signed off on as safe and effective by regulatory authorities. The military will be used to help distribute doses.

'We're getting ready so that when we get the good word that we have the vaccine, we have the formula, we have what we need, we're ready to go, as opposed to taking years,"" Trump said.

Trump acknowledged the risk and expense but said, ""we'll be saving years if we do this properly.""

The initiative brings together expertise from the National Institutes for Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies.The partnership also joins the resources of the Department of Health and Human Services together with the Department of Defense.

At the news conference, Trump brought to the podium venture capitalist and former pharmaceutical head Moncef Slaoui. It was announced Wednesday he would lead the partnership.

Slaoui was chair of the vaccines division at pharmaceutical GlaxoSmithKline, a British multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in London. He is now a partner at Medicxi Capital, a Philadelphia-area venture capital firm.

In addition, four-star Army Gen. Gustave Perna will serve as the chief operating officer overseeing logistics. Perna is the commanding general at U.S. Army Materiel Command in Huntsville, Alabama.

The national project will bring together the best of American industry and innovation, the full resources of the United States government and the excellence and precision of the United States military, Trump said.

The U.S. is working with its allies and other countries on the effort. Specifically, Trump said, the U.S. would work with China, despite previous reports that a vaccine from the country where the pandemic began would not be considered for use in the United States.

""We have no ego, whoever gets it, we're going to work with them, they're going to work with us,"" Trump said, adding the U.S. is viewed as the vaccine effort's global leader. ""Whoever gets it is going to be very proud to give it.""

In order to make a vaccine available to the entire American population by January, the Food and Drug Administration mayissue an emergency use authorization. Such orders allow unapproved medical products to be used during a public health crisis, without the benefit of the validated testing that would normally take place.

""We're working for a fully approved vaccine but we'll also use ... all of our regulatory tools appropriate to bring vaccine available for the entire American population by January,"" Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said at the news conference.

In the past, drugs authorized for emergency use have mostly been given to people with terminal illnesses with little to lose.

“There’s never been an emergency use authorization for a vaccine before because it’s by and large a technology that is given to healthy people,"" said Thomas Bollyky, who directs the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Big ideas are certainly needed, said Lois Privor-Dumm, policy director at the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

But, she cautioned: ""We just need to ensure that decisions are made thoughtfully and in an apolitical manner as to not undermine the existing structures and expertise in place to keep vaccines safe and ensure impact. Any misstep risks eroding confidence in vaccines that could have lasting implications.""

Trump said even if a vaccine is not discovered, the United States would prevail. He asserted the coronavirus could disappear on its own without an immunization, though having one would put America ahead.

“It’ll go away at some point, it’ll go away,” he said. ""Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back.""

528,"Once airports and borders open again and people are able to fly freely — a process already in play as airports of all sizes around the world ready strategies to ensure healthy air travel — how much are you ready to change your flying habits?

As much as was required after 9/11? Less? More?

Considering some of the changes already happening and the many more recommended before airports can reopen safely to commercial routes, experts are referring to the coronavirus pandemic as ‘the new terrorism,’ triggering the biggest crisis the airline industry has ever faced.

Let’s start with the entire process of checking in for flights, which some calculate could take up to four hours and involve social distancing, sanitation of passengers and luggage, wider spaces for various lines and waiting to board.

Nine out of 10 experts expect slower turnarounds between flights due to the need of thorough cleaning of cabins and following of sanitary measures at airports.

In the short run, though, it’s expected that reduced passenger numbers and airlines traveling to a smaller pool of destinations may reduce delays.
• None American Airlines workers bring class action saying material in new gray uniforms made them sick
• None The Brave New World of Bill Gates and Big Telecom” by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Dafna Tachover

What You Can Expect

Among the steps under consideration: no cabin bags, no lounges, no automatic upgrades, face masks, surgical gloves, self-check-in, self-bag-drop-off, immunity passports, on-the-spot blood tests and sanitation disinfection tunnels.

Digital technologies and automation will play a critical role in the future of air travel. The need to reduce “touchpoints” at airports implies mandatory use of biometric boarding that allows passengers to board planes with only their face as a passport.

A number of airlines including British Airways, Qantas and EasyJet already are using the technology.

According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), “the ‘new normal’ at major airports, such as Heathrow, JFK and Singapore Changi will include almost exclusive use of online check-ins, and contactless payments.

Then there are the radical changes the airports will have to make starting most probably with stopping non-fliers from entering at all except for unaccompanied minors or others who need assistance.

They will need more extensive all-biometric check-in systems and efficient DYI for dropping off bags, ‘travel bubbles,’ or tunnels for disinfection. (After being checked in, luggage may also be put through a disinfection fogging tunnel.) They also must install demarcation of the spaces for social distancing in corridors and concourses, larger spaces for queues and waiting, plexiglass or other protective barriers at customer service counters, hand sanitation stations and thermal scanning to check crowds for fever-grade body temperatures, which already are in use in some major airports.
• None Bill Gates’ Philanthropy: 30,000 Indian girls used as guinea pigs to test cancer vaccine

“Only those ‘fit to fly’ will be allowed to enter,” predicts the airline strategy firm SimpliFlying, in a recent report, where it identifies more than 70 different areas in the passenger journey that “are expected to either change or to be introduced from scratch, including having bags ‘sanitagged’ after going through fogging, electrostatic or UV-disinfection to restore confidence in flying after COVID-19.”

The Telegraph explains that “it may sound futuristic, but UV sanitation is likely to become commonplace at the world’s airports. London Heathrow says it is to begin trialling the process for its security trays.”

And then comes boarding

The boarding process is expected also to become ‘touchless,’ with options including facial recognition, already used in some U.S. airports for international flights. On the planes, there will be blocked seats, electrostatic spraying, personnel in protective gear and, of course, masks. Major European carriers such as Air France and KLM already have made them compulsory and it’s expected that all other airlines will do the same.

As for food, the tendency is to stop serving altogether on short-haul flights, while the airlines consider ‘light refreshments’ for long-haul flights. Hong Kong Airlines has decided to stop offering food altogether.

At the arrival point, SimpliFlying forecasts, international passengers will need to show some type of immunity document/passport, also advocated by the International Air Transport Association, IATA, to border control agents. Once a vaccine has been found, that could shift to a proof of vaccination.

“Arriving passengers will also undergo another temperature screening at their final destination and potentially even blood tests for COVID-19,” Conde Nast predicts. “Some airports like Hong Kong and Vienna are testing passengers for the coronavirus with a blood test before they are allowed to enter the country. Those types of tests, however, might be short-lived.”

Thermal testing is also recommended by IATA, “while Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic, has said ‘pre-screening’ of travelers should be introduced ideally as early in the passenger journey as possible,” reports The Telegraph.

Although there are no standard decisions about making such tests and screening mandatory, airports and airlines are pushing for uniform regulations. It’s not clear who will be responsible for checking travelers’ temperatures and other Covid-19 symptoms, for example.

SimpliFlying predicts that a new federal health agency likely will be created to coordinate health screenings inside airports.

As immediately following 9/11, a process of trial-and-error is likely, with many airports and airlines following what some ‘pioneers’ establish.

“There will be new protocols for check-in involving digital technology; hand sanitizer stations at frequent points including where luggage is stored; contactless payment instead of cash; using stairs more often than lifts where the two-meter-rule can be harder to maintain; and fitness equipment being moved for greater separation, among other examples,” the WTTC wrote in a recent report.

The international institution says that the sector will face a gradual return to travel over the coming months as a “new normal” emerges before a vaccine becomes available on a mass scale, large enough to inoculate billions of people.

Travel is likely to return first to domestic markets with “staycations,” then to a country’s nearest neighbors before expanding across regions, and then finally across continents to welcome the return of journeys to long-haul international destinations. WTTC believes that younger travelers in the 18-35 age group, who appear to be less vulnerable to COVID-19, also may be among the first to begin traveling again.

According to Gloria Guevara, WTTC President & CEO, traveling in the ‘new normal’ age requires coordinated actions, including new standards and protocols, “for a safe and responsible road to recovery for the global Travel & Tourism sector as consumers start planning trips again.”

The new protocols and standards are being defined following feedback from associations representing the different travel sectors including International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Airport Council International (ACI), Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), United States Travel Association (USTA), Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Travel Commission (ETC) and the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO).

But with protocols and standards, biometric systems, immunity passports and the best intentions for a safe road to recovery, the future of traveling, as New York Times’s Niraj Chokshi explains, is still bleak: “With much of the world closed for business, and no widely available vaccine in sight, it may be months, if not years, before airlines operate as many flights as they did before the crisis. Even when people start flying again, the industry could be transformed, much as it was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.”

And in the process, as it is already the case, some airlines, especially smaller ones, will be push into bankruptcy or become takeover targets. “Consumer fears about catching the virus on crowded planes could lead to reconfigured seating. Carriers may initially entice wary travelers with discounts, but if they can’t fill up flights, they may resort to raising ticket prices.”

For Dave CalhounIn, CEO of Boeing, not only are the smaller airlines in danger. He thinks that at least a major U.S carrier will “most likely” go out of business due to the coronavirus pandemic. In an interview with NBC News’ TODAY, on Tuesday he told Savannah Guthrie: “…something will happen when September comes around. Traffic levels will not be back to 100%. They won’t even be back to 25%. Maybe by the end of the year we approach 50%. So there will definitely be adjustments that have to be made on the part of the airlines.”

855,"A single sperm donor is the biological father of at least 12 children who all developed — an extraordinary case that prompted one woman to sue her sperm bank, according to news reports.

The case came to light when the woman, Danielle Rizzo of Illinois, was researching treatments for her two sons, who both have autism, according to . Both sons were conceived with sperm from the same donor, and Rizzo was shocked to discover that other mothers who used the same donor also had sons with autism, the Post reported.

Rizzo was told that the likelihood of all these related children having autism by chance was like all the mothers ""opening up a dictionary and pointing to the same letter of the same word on the same page at the same time,"" she told the Post.

That means a mutation in the donor's sperm was likely responsible. But is there a single ""autism gene?""

In short, no: There are hundreds of genetic variations tied to autism spectrum disorder, according to the . In most cases, these mutations increase a person's risk of autism, but they don't destine someone to develop the condition. In other words, genes typically play only a partial role in the risk of developing autism, with environmental factors, such as the parents' ages and birth complications, contributing as well.

But in rare cases, genetic mutations are thought to be the main cause of autism. Only about 2% to 4% of people with autism have these mutations, according to the NIH.

""We call autism one thing, but it's different in every person. In some, it's all about the genes. Some it's a combination of genes and the environment. Some people, it's unknown,"" Dr. Wendy Chung, a professor of pediatric medicine at Columbia University, told the Post.

Studies of Rizzo's children found that they had two mutations tied to autism in genes called MBD1 and SHANK1.

Most reproductive clinics test for several hundred genetic conditions, but there is no test for autism, The Post reported.

In Rizzo's lawsuit, she alleged that the donor's profile had false information. For example, she said that the donor did not have a college degree, as the profile listed, and that he had been , which was omitted from the profile, the Post reported. She settled the lawsuit in March for $250,000.

• Beyond Vaccines: 5 Things that Might Really Cause Autism",mainstream,M0886e,vaccine.autism
23,"The world is in a race to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. We are determined to defeat this disease, which continues to infect millions of people and cause death and suffering around the world. Given the urgent crisis, it’s clear that a vaccine cannot be developed soon enough to help stem the pandemic. With the goal of accomplishing what in normal times would have been deemed impossible, we are engaging collaboratively with regulatory authorities to adapt traditional vaccine research and development to meet this unprecedented challenge.

With our partner BioNTech, a German biotech company, we are developing not one but at least four different vaccine candidates all at once. We began testing the vaccine in Germany on April 23. This week, we’re starting to test our mRNA vaccine candidates in a U.S. trial — only six weeks after kicking off our COVID-19 partnership.

Never in my over 25 years of developing vaccines have I seen a clinical trial launched at this speed. Usually, it takes years of dedicated research to get to this point. This record milestone is a testament to the innovation and collaboration among researchers and colleagues from two very different organizations and cultures, unprecedented access to advice and support from regulatory agencies and other government agencies, and the willingness of companies to go above and beyond what is “normal” for them.

Our approach is based on the same technology that we are developing in another partnership with BioNTech — an mRNA seasonal influenza vaccine, which has not yet entered clinical studies. If successful, that vaccine could potentially transform the yearly “scramble” of producing a flu vaccine by increasing the speed of development and coverage of circulating strains. We saw the opportunity to pursue a collaboration with BioNTech on the same platform technology for COVID-19, which could potentially help us develop a vaccine faster than using traditional approaches.

Unlike many conventional vaccines — which usually take months to years of research because they entail first developing biological cell, virus or bacterial production processes — mRNA vaccines are fully synthetic, well characterized and use nearly identical processes for purification. If the vaccine platform is proven to work, it could allow us to quickly adapt the platform to other pathogens by exchanging the small portion of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic code for that of another pathogen.

In most conventional viral vaccines used today, weakened or killed forms of a virus, or protein components of the pathogen known as antigens, are administered to a person. The immune system then recognizes these foreign virus components and unleashes a multipronged defense: special immune cells to kill infected cells and specific antibodies to prevent the virus from infecting our cells. Then, if a vaccinated person encounters the virus in the future, their immune system already knows how to recognize, respond and defeat it before they become sick.

The mRNA vaccine technology does not require the lengthy production of weakened or killed viruses or the viral antigen. Instead, mRNA, a set of genetic instructions coding for viral antigens, is injected into the body. Once inside cells, these instructions guide the cell’s machinery to produce the antigens, which can then teach the immune system how to recognize and fight off a future virus attack. In addition, RNA platforms can also “help” the immune system mount a stronger response to an antigen than that induced by the antigen alone. The genetic material RNA can be seen by the immune system as “viral.” That launches a potent arm of the immune system called innate immunity, which recognizes patterns of common pathogens such as viruses and bacteria and increases the potency of the vaccine.

Clinical trials at pandemic speed 

Vaccine clinical trials are typically run with only one vaccine candidate in three separate phases, moving from small safety and immunogenicity studies then scaling up to large efficacy trials that usually involve tens of thousands of participants. It’s a deliberative and sequential process that can take many years.

Due to the urgency of the pandemic, well-established clinical development paths would take too long for us. To shorten the time from preclinical to clinical evaluation, we are using a unique approach to test at least four different RNA vaccine candidates in parallel in a smaller number of clinical trial participants.

The ongoing U.S. phase 1/2 study uses a new trial design that maximizes development speed while ensuring safety by quickly eliminating suboptimal vaccine candidates for the benefit of the “winner” in the race. Instead of using sequential individual trials, we plan to adapt the same phase 1/2 trial in real time and based on continuous data collection to select the final vaccine candidate, ensure safety and tolerability and collect functional immunogenicity data to inform the seamless transition into the clinical efficacy stage of the study. Given this design, we are shaving many years from the vaccine development timeline, and assuming success, we’ll potentially be able to roll out a promising vaccine candidate as early as fall 2020.

Early vaccine clinical trials are typically done exclusively in younger populations first and then tested in older populations. We are also changing this model: After determining the safety of each candidate’s dose level in younger populations, we will then immediately test that dose level in older adults, so that necessary safety and immunogenicity data for the population most vulnerable to COVID-19 are available almost at the same time to begin the efficacy stage of the trial.

The war against the virus

The other critical aspect of creating a successful vaccine is ensuring that we can manufacture and distribute hundreds of millions of doses. Again we have changed the typical development approach. Under normal circumstances, the investment of many hundreds of millions to billions of dollars is needed to build vaccine production capacity. These investments occur only after a vaccine candidate has proven itself to be safe and immunogenic.

Today we are compressing a process that usually takes years to one that may take only several months, with huge upfront investments of capital and resources before we have clinical evidence that the vaccine candidate may be successful. To that end, we are working together with BioNTech and Pfizer’s manufacturing teams to quickly scale up infrastructure and try to eliminate any potential bottlenecks in sourcing the materials needed to produce hundreds of millions of vaccine doses in record time.

I’ve dedicated my scientific career to creating and developing vaccines so that vulnerable populations all over the globe can be protected from disease and death. I have witnessed firsthand the tremendous power of vaccines to change lives and help ensure that children have a fighting chance to grow up healthy.

Vaccine R&D has always been challenging, but there is normally sufficient time to solve scientific problems during development. The current crisis has turned our world upside down as time is the one thing we do not have. We are all energized and inspired to offer potential solutions with an unprecedented sense of urgency to make what seemed impossible only a couple of months ago now possible. The ongoing experience has fortified my belief in the power of science, researchers, health care professionals and others working closely to address the pandemic. This virus is our enemy. And we need to do everything in our power to win the war against it, not tomorrow, but today.

Since their founding 120 years, the secret Anglo-American Pilgrims Society, Wellcome Trust, Marconi Wireless and the Empire Press Union (creators of MI6, MI5 and GCHQ) have been testing deadly viruses on human beings not to heal, but to destroy humanity (e.g., foot and mouth, Spanish flu, Ebola, AIDS, SARS, MERS, anthrax, sarin, Hong Kong flu, swine flu, bird flu, zika, yellow fever, encephalitis, West Nile, diphtheria, malaria, Coronavirus COVID-19)

To these satanists, viruses are their silent armies marching through our blood streams to destroy humanity in order to make more room for them

Are they worried about catching the virus? No, they have a patent and already have the antidote

(MAR. 16, 2020)—This is one of the most important posts we have ever released. In the last 48 hours—just as the Coronavirus lock down was occurring in the US—researchers uncovered the likely culprits behind the Coronavirus bioweapon.

Despite the obvious U.S. Patent. No. 10,130,701 held by The Pirbright Institute (UK) operated by The Wellcome Trust, no one in the mainstream media is talking about this glaring fact. Even the alt-media is mute. We believe because the culprits are using every propaganda trick in their playbook to prevent a light being shined on the British Privy Council and the Queen.

China has been blamed, sort of, although the specifics are vague. We have shown that just a four-hour drive from Wuhan is Nanchang and the Merial Animal Health Institute manufacturing vaccines for The Pirbright Institute.

The decision by The Pirbright Institute (Wellcome Trust) to move their Merial Health vaccine manufacturing plant offsite was taken after a virulent foot and mouth outbreak at their Merial plant.

On Oct. 12, 2009, Merial moved their plant to Nanchang, China and slapped a new “Boehringer Mannheim “shingle on their Merial Pirbright UK plant, then carried on merrily. Same plant, different name, same controller: Wellcome Trust.

This means the British have, right now, a Merial (Wellcome Trust) vaccine manufacturing plant just four hours away from Coronavirus ground zero. But, why is no one pointing out this obviously suspicious FACT. All it would take to release the Coronavirus in Wuhan is for an employee at Merial to get in the car a vile of Coronavirus vile, and sprinkle it around in Wuhan.

Better yet, send a 5G signal in Wuhan (a 5G test city) to instruct Coronavirus nanotubes developed by just indicted Harvard Professor and popular Wuhan University of Technology nanotechnology lecturer Dr. Charles Lieber to release their deadly Coronavirus microbe payloads. See previous post.

WHO WAS THE WELLCOME TRUST CHAIRMAN WHO SET UP THE MERIAL NANCHANG PLANT NEAR WUHAN?

The Wellcome Trust chair was Baroness Elizabeth Lydia Manningham-Buller, the former director of British MI5 (2002-2007). Her mother was GCHQ. Her father was Privy Council, Attorney General and Solicitor General, with a “Bullying Manner.” She is an eighth-generation peer.

That’s not all, Manningham-Buller also chaired Genome Research Limited (2008-2015), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wellcome Trust.

That’s not all, Manningham-Buller also chaired Genome Research Limited (2008-2015), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wellcome Trust.

In Oct. 2013, Baronness Manningham-Buller was the keynote speaker at the Pilgrims of Great Britain London at the Sir Harry Brittain Memorial Lecture. Sir Harry Brittain was the founder of the Pilgrims Society (with about 50 British peers including Viscount Alfred Milner and Winston Churchill) in 1902. MI5, MI6 and GCHQ were founded from newspapermen who attended the Pilgrims’ First Imperial Press Conference, 1909. Given her father’s membership in the Privy Council and her Wellcome Trust intimacies, her membership in the Privy Council and the Pilgrims Society are certain.

Operating from the same Wellcome Genome Campus is Genomics England Limited (controlled by the Queen’s Golden Share).

Of particular note are two Genomics England director-chairs:

We have already written about Sir Chisholm’s formation of QinetiQ (when SERCO moved into the U.S.) and the fact that former C.I.A. director George Tenet, and former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Edmund P. Giambastiani Jr. were QinetiQ directors. QinetiQ has been awarded over $8 billion in U.S. contracts in space, satellites, information technology, military and government agencies. See previous post.

QinetiQ has received over $8.5 billion U.S. federal contracts. (PDF | Excel-downloads directly to your Downloads folder).

While our research zeroed in long ago on the Anglo-American Pilgrims Society as the actual “Deep State” globally, and while we have gotten tantalizingly close to find this person, his or her name has alluded us.

Now we have found him: Sir Jonathan Richard Symonds.

On Sep. 01, 2019, Symonds was appointed chairman of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Plc, the successor to Glaxo Wellcome.

GSK is strategically aligned with Wellcome Trust where former MI5 director Manningham-Buller is the current chair.

Symonds has been a director of HSBC Holdings plc since 2014-just months after James Comey left an HSBC directorship to become FBI director. He has been HSBC deputy group chair since 2018, he was also chair of HSBC Bank plc (2014-2018) until just recently.

Symonds was also chief financial officer of drug manufacturer Novartis AG (2009-2013).

Prior to Novartis, Symonds was managing director of Goldman Sachs (2007-2009).

Symonds was also chief financial officer of AstraZeneca PLC (1997-2007).

Here is the lynchpin that shows Symonds is the organizational Deep Throat of the Anglo-American Pilgrims Society. He was director and audit chair of the newly-formed QinetiQ (Feb. 28, 2003-Jun. 30, 2004)

THE PRIVY COUNCIL’S ACCOUNTANT FOR THE QUEEN’S “GOLDEN SHARE” CONTROLS WORLD COMMERCE

Symonds was QinetiQ’s second director just long enough to set up the chart of accounts and the share stock structure giving the Monarch’s Special Share (“Golden Share”) control of the company no matter how many sub-classes of stock were established.

QinetiQ shares property with The Pirbright Institute (Wellcome Trust), the patent holder of the Coronavirus financed by Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. See also Coronavirus Traced to the British Crown.

Our latest discovery that Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller, former head of MI5 (2002-2007), is chair of Wellcome Trust and their related DNA-harvesting research associates, further confirms that the Anglo-American Pilgrims Society are making their move to dramatically reduce the world population by attacking our blood streams

Their secret global communications network is being managed by the Anglo-American Pilgrims Society that is protected by the British Privy Council and the American Senior Executive Service (SES)

They operate a secret global satellite system for themselves out of the Cobbett Hill Earthstation adjacent to The Pirbright Institute (UK)—on the site of the 2007 foot and mouth outbreak (READ: There are demons in those fields)

Yes, this is hard to believe, but these facts are now screaming for us to pay attention.

58,"Could the flu vaccine combat the ? That's the question President Donald Trump asked during a White house roundtable discussion between his coronavirus task force and pharmaceutical company executives on Monday (March 2).

His question was answered with a direct ""no"" from an executive. The is designed to prevent infections with viruses, which are very different than coronaviruses. But the answer is slightly more complicated than that: The flu vaccine won't prevent you from getting a coronavirus, but it can help officials better respond to the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.

""I do think immunizing people against influenza has a very important indirect effect,"" said Dr. Albert Ko, a professor and department chair at the Yale School of Public Health.

First, health care workers are already burdened by flu cases so getting a flu shot, reduces the number of flu patients, thereby helping to ""relieve pressures"" in hospitals also treating patients with COVID-19, he said.

But there's another reason a flu shot could improve the country's response to the new outbreak: the U.S. is lagging behind other countries in testing for COVID-19. And that's unlikely to improve in the near term. On Thursday (March 5), Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the coronavirus, announced that the U.S. does not have enough test kits to meet demand.

How does that relate to the flu? If people get their flu shots, fewer people come down with the flu and come into clinics with nonspecific symptoms such as fever and cough, which overlap with .

Having fewer flu patients will make it easier to find the patients with COVID-19, he said.

Higher vaccination rates would ""make us much more efficient in detecting coronavirus,"" cases, Ko told Live Science. Finding COVID-19 cases is still akin to picking a ""needle out of a haystack,"" but reducing flu cases can ""decrease the haystack,"" he added.

As SARS-CoV-2 is spreading in communities on both coasts of the U.S., distinguishing between flu and COVID-19 will become more difficult.

On the bright side, it is ""incredibly rare,"" to catch both the flu and COVID-19 at once, said Dr. Eric Cioe Peña, director of Global Health, Northwell Health in New York and an emergency room physician. ""Usually if they have one, they don't have the other.""

Flu season is naturally dying down as spring approaches, but for those who haven't yet done so, ""we still recommend getting a flu shot,"" he added.

People with the flu are still coming into the hospital and there's always a chance there could be a second spike of the flu, Peña told Live Science.

That being said, flu cases in New York City have been down 25% each week for the past two weeks, he said. It's a positive step ""that we aren't seeing as many flu patients in the ER, so we have more room for severe coronavirus patients,"" Peña said.

At Northwell Health, patients aren't being tested for COVID-19 unless they meet criteria for admission to the hospital. ""That’s the only time that we're really testing because of the limited supply of tests,"" he added.

1185,"This is especially true in the community of Khayelitsha, a coronavirus hotspot that also has the highest prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in the Cape Town metropolitan area; in 2015, one-third of its pregnant mothers were HIV positive.

“The people who were struggling before are now doubly at risk,” says Claire Keene, Khayelitsha medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which runs the field hospital in partnership with local health authorities.

South Africa’s COVID-19 epidemic has bucked some of the trends seen in other nations. Locking down early, just three weeks after the first case was confirmed on March 5, seems to have spared the country the rapid exponential rise seen in Italy and Spain. But the country has been unable to stop the spread, as South Korea and New Zealand managed to. Disease models predict that COVID-19 will claim between 40,000 and 48,000 South African lives by the end of this year.

Now, as the country eases restrictions, which will allow its cash-strapped citizens to earn a living, South Africa is bracing for a wave of infections. Health-care networks designed to fight the world’s most devastating co-epidemic—HIV and TB—are being subsumed into the COVID-19 response. The government has deployed more than 28,000 community health workers to screen for the coronavirus in poor areas, and teams once established to trace the contacts of TB patients have pivoted to handling this year’s pandemic.

Yet many fear that shifting these resources could undo some of the hard-won progress made against HIV and TB. National data show that during the lockdown, the number of TB tests conducted was cut in half, as people couldn’t visit clinics, or didn’t want to for fear they might catch the coronavirus. According to many health workers, the lockdown saw a drop in patients accessing their TB and HIV therapies, and a large nationwide survey conducted by the country’s Human Sciences Research Council found that 13 percent of patients have struggled to access regular medication during the COVID-19 lockdown.

“It’s going to take us years to recover what we’ve lost in the past few months,” says Gavin Churchyard, CEO of the Aurum Institute, a Johannesburg-based research and health nonprofit.

The Khayelitsha Field Hospital is one of several temporary facilities established to house COVID-19 patients in Cape Town, which—with two-thirds of the country’s more than 50,000 coronavirus cases—is the current epicentre of South Africa’s epidemic. The field hospitals in Cape Town collectively plan to add 1,400 beds by the end of this month—but projections show the city could still run out of beds when the peak hits in July.

Khayelitsha residents face myriad challenges, from food and job insecurity to gender-based violence and drug abuse. Whereas any of these challenges could tip somebody into poverty or cause them to drop out of long-term HIV or TB care, COVID-19 “will make all those things worse,” Keene says.",mainstream,M0751e,coronavirus; covid.19; vaccine
644,"The UK and US have issued a joint warning cyber-spies are targeting the health sector.

Hackers linked to foreign states have been hunting for information, including Covid-19 data and vaccine research, they say.

UK sources say they have seen extensive activity but do not believe there has been any data theft so far.

Those behind the activity are not named in the alert but are thought to include China, Russia and Iran.

The three countries have all seen major outbreaks of the virus but have denied previous claims of involvement in such activity.

The joint advisory says the UK and US are currently investigating a number of incidents in which other states are targeting pharmaceutical companies, medical-research organisations, and universities, looking for intelligence and sensitive data, including research on the virus.

Understanding how other countries are dealing with the Covid-19 crisis and progress in research has become a high priority for intelligence agencies around the world.

In a crisis, every state will want to use its intelligence capability to better inform itself.

And in a locked-down world, cyber-espionage is more practical than traditional human espionage, making it another field where an existing trend towards online working may be accelerated.

Analysts say they are seeing a particular rise in aggressive operations from a range of states at the moment.

And this has meant organisations that might not have considered themselves to be top targets for hackers from foreign states are now in their sights.
• A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?
• AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise
• TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has been working with these organisations since the start of the crisis, to offer advice and protection.

And the new public advisory, issued jointly with its US equivalent, the Cyber-security and Infrastructure Security Agency(CISA), aims to further increase awareness of the threat.

""In today's world, there is nothing more valuable or worth stealing than any kind of biomedical research that is going to help with a coronavirus vaccine,"" senior US intelligence official Bill Evanina told BBC News last week.

At Tuesday's daily briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""As well as providing practical advice, the UK will continue to counter those who conduct cyber-attacks.

""And we're working very closely with our international partners both to respond to the threats but also to deter the gangs and the arms of state who lie behind them.""

UK authorities are understood to have offered advice to Oxford University, at the leading edge of developing a vaccine, and Imperial College in London, which has played a key role in the epidemiological modelling that has shaped policy responses.

The advisory warns cyber-spies are targeting supply chains and taking advantage of people remotely working, with a technique called password-spraying - in which they try to use commonly used passwords to access accounts.

And cyber-criminals could target healthcare providers, knowing they may be even more willing than usual to pay a ransom for the return of their data.

""Protecting the healthcare sector is the NCSC's first and foremost priority at this time and we're working closely with the NHS to keep their systems safe,"" operations director Paul Chichester said.

Meanwhile, Western spies will be focusing hard on China as they seek to understand what Beijing may know of the virus's origins - with the US administration pushing the theory it may have escaped from a lab - as well as looking for any data on the true extent of the outbreak in the country.",mainstream,M0a450,vaccine
526,"American drug maker Moderna said Monday that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced antibodies in a small group of healthy people in an early trial.

The company said eight people who received two small amounts of its vaccine developed antibodies similar to those developed by people who have recovered from the disease.

The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases led the experiment, also called a trial. It involved 45 volunteers who received one or two shots of differing amounts of the vaccine.

Tal Zaks is the chief medical officer at Moderna. Based on early results of the trial, he said the vaccine “has the potential to prevent COVID-19 disease….” He also said the company now can better choose the vaccine amount needed for further experiments.

The testing involved three different amounts. Zaks said the two smaller amounts of vaccine seem safe and the larger amount caused some short-term side effects. Three study subjects developed “flu-like” conditions following a second shot of the large dose. Moderna said it plans to drop that amount for the next part of the trial.

Amesh Adalja is an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was not involved in the study. He told Reuters that the findings are meaningful, but noted that they come from only eight people. “It was designed for safety. Not for efficacy,” he said.



 Moderna has been permitted to start a second part of human testing that will involve several hundreds of people. In April, the U.S. government gave the company $483 million for vaccine development. Last week, U.S. officials gave the vaccine special recognition to help speed the process for approval.

Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna, said the company is hoping to start part three of the study in July. The company will try to find the lowest amount of vaccine necessary to protect people.

In May, Moderna and the biotechnology company Lonza agreed to work together over the next ten years to make a vaccine. The partnership could lead to the manufacture of 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine treatments a year.

There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19. Almost 4.8 million people are confirmed to have had the virus. It is known to have killed about 320,000. However, experts think the numbers may be underreported.

The World Health Organization has listed more than 100 efforts to develop effective treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus. The list includes clinical trials in China, at the University of Oxford, and with American drug makers Pfizer, Inovio and Moderna.

Experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop. The results of Moderna’s early trial have not been published. But the news lifted the company’s stock prices and spread hope that a solution against the infectious disease might be close.

231,"A CORONAVIRUS vaccine being developed by Oxford University may not stop people becoming infected with the disease, experts warn.

The latest animal trials of the ""front runner"" vaccine carried out using six monkeys revealed all went on to catch the killer infection.

⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates

The revelations come as Drug giant AstraZeneca said it will make 30 million doses of the vaccine by September if it works and the UK will be the first to get them.

Oxford finished its first phase of human trials this week - with everyone planned having received their vaccine doses on schedule.

However, following the publication of detailed trial results it was revealed the vaccine was unable to prevent monkeys from catching Covid-19.

On the upside, none of the vaccinated animals displayed pneumonia which suggests that, while not stopping the virus, it may be partially protective.

The setback has led some to question the effectiveness of the jab and in particular whether it will be able to prevent the spread of the virus.

Dr William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor, said: ""All of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged, as judged by recovery of virus genomic RNA from nasal secretions.""



 He wrote in an article on Forbes: ""There was no difference in the amount of viral RNA detected from this site in the vaccinated monkeys as compared to the unvaccinated animals. Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected.""

Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said the data suggests the jab may not be able to prevent the spread of the virus, reports the Telegraph.

""That viral loads in the noses of vaccinated and unvaccinated animals were identical is very significant. If the same happened in humans, vaccination would not stop spread,"" he said.

""I genuinely believe that this finding should warrant an urgent re-appraisal of the ongoing human trials of the ChAdOx1 vaccine.""

The trials on the rhesus macaque monkeys were carried out at the National Institute of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratory in the US.

Six monkeys were infected with single doses of the vaccine and then exposed to the coronavirus.

A control group of three non-vaccinated monkeys were also infected.

Both groups were then monitored for seven days for signs of developing Covid-19.

However, none of the vaccinated monkeys displayed pneumonia which suggests it may be in some way protective.",mainstream,M0ba1c,vaccine; vaccine.covid
208,"Getting ahead of the virus

Viruses are stealthy. They disguise themselves as they infect a host and penetrate that host’s cells, which gives them a head start over the body’s immune response. Once a cell recognizes certain telltale signs of a pathogen, it throws out an alarm signal to the immune system. But because the virus has that head start, it still has time to replicate itself and infect a new host before the immune system can catch up.

That’s why someone’s first experience with an infectious disease can be so nasty. The immune system is not so easily tricked a second time: When it’s beaten an invader once, it keeps a specialized weapons cache dedicated to that particular pathogen, ready to mount a high-speed reaction if it’s ever detected again. So, the second time the disease shows up in your body, the virus won’t have that handy head start.

To have herd immunity, each infected person must, on average, infect less than one person (though clearly, it’s not possible to infect half a person; if some infected people pass on the infection and others don’t, the average transmission rate will be less than one.) Once the transmission rate drops below one, a community has herd immunity. That won’t stop each and every case, but it will prevent the disease from spreading indefinitely.

Many of our lessons on herd immunity come from the measles, because it's so contagious. The more infectious a disease is, the more people who need to be immune to reach herd immunity. One person with measles, for instance, could infect up to 18 other people in a susceptible population. To get that transmission rate all the way down to less than one, almost everyone in the population needs to act as a buffer between an infected person and a new potential host. That’s why measles needs such a high rate of herd immunity—around 95 percent.

The do’s and don’ts of making a herd

Vaccines create a weapons cache for a disease without the body ever having to fight off the disease itself, which is why herd immunity is something that’s generally pursued through vaccination rather than infection. For example, about 30 percent of measles cases have complications such as seizures, pneumonia, and encephalitis, resulting in about two deaths for every thousand cases in the U.S. Exposing a whole population to measles would be a dangerous way to cultivate herd immunity among the survivors.

“The problem with coronavirus is that no-one has had it before, regardless of age,” says Gostic of the University of Chicago. It’s almost as if chicken pox had just emerged for the first time, leaving adults more susceptible to the more severe cases that come with age, she explains.

Herd immunity also isn’t something that can work for any disease. It doesn’t matter how many people are vaccinated against tetanus, for example: If someone who isn’t vaccinated steps on a rusty nail, they can still get infected, because tetanus lives in reservoirs outside of the human body. An infection must be transmitted between people for herd immunity to have a protective effect.

Immunity also doesn’t always last that long. HIV mutates so quickly that it can actually evolve within a single person, says Jessie Abbate, an infectious disease expert at the Research Institute for Development in France. Swiftly mutating flu is also a moving target for immunity and vaccines, which is why each flu season’s vaccine needs to anticipate the strain that will circulate widely, she explains.

What does this mean for coronavirus?

Four other coronaviruses already circulate among humans, says Gaunt, and they all cause the common cold, since we don’t stay immune to those viruses for very long. If the novel coronavirus is similar, that means that people would need to be repeatedly vaccinated or infected for herd immunity to be sustained.

Some reports describe reinfections of the novel coronavirus in people who tested positive again after they had already recovered. It’s not clear, though, that these are actually cases of reinfection—it’s more likely that they can be explained by people continuing to shed the virus for a long time, and that the level of virus shedding fluctuates over time.

Rapid reinfection is, for now, “an outside possibility,” Abbate agrees. If people were able to get sick again really quickly, we wouldn’t see the rapid decline in case numbers that is happening in certain parts of the world. And it would go against almost every other virus that we’ve known about, she says.",mainstream,M08be4,population.control; vaccine; vaccine.covid
1027,"Financial writer and professional trader Rick Ackerman says the economy is tanking, and there is no way to avoid an economic depression. Ackerman explains, “It’s going to be an interesting depression because we have all the infrastructure of affluence. We have achieved a pinnacle of affluence, and the metaphor I use is riding to the soup kitchen on an $8,000 trail bike. . . . I hope we find things that make life worth going on without all the stuff. So, we are going to be in a period of living without all the good stuff, and that is going to be the norm. There is also a really hopeful side to economic distress, but we are most surely headed into a period of severe distress . . . and a period of living without. We will find we are not living without things that are intrinsic to human nature that are good. . . .We going to have to find ways to get along because we are headed into hard times.”

A few years ago, Ackerman predicted that the trend for interest rates was down. The 10 year Treasury is now near a record low. Does Ackerman see rates going even lower? Ackerman says, “Yes, I see lower rates. I think we will have lower rates until, at some point in the future, people will start sniffing out a hyperinflation. You know I have been a deflationist for a lot of years. I think we will have to cross the valley of deflation, but somewhere there is a hyperinflation. It won’t take high interest rates to do it because we will be dealing with a real burden of debt that is going to be crushing no matter where interest rates are even if they are fixed at 2%.” Ackerman sees the 10-year Treasury hitting “.25%.”

Is real estate a safe bet? Ackerman says, “When real assets start to sink like real estate, what are you going to do? Are you going to send mortgage checks out on behalf of homeowners to the lenders? . . . . You’d have to be crazy to think when real estate opens up it will be trading at the prices in February. We will get a 25% haircut from the get go . . . because we are going to have to deal with a lot of speculative excesses. . . . Minimum, it will be down 25%, which will bring us close to the 2007-2008 where real estate across the country lost about 33% of its value. I have been saying for a long time that real estate will sink 70% with maybe a 90% drop in second homes. Everything has come back from the last time, but I think we are going to do the whole 70% drop in value this next time.”

Ackerman also thinks cash will be valuable in the future because it will be rare. Ackerman points out that the “debt being destroyed and defaulted on dwarfs the amount of money printing” for now, and that is deflationary. So, he likes cash in the near term and gold in the longer term. Ackerman contends, “What do we use to buy stuff now? We use credit cards or real cash pretty much. If we have deleveraging of the derivatives market and the daisy chain and clearing relationships for credit cards and debit cards . . . I don’t think that system would survive the implosion of the derivatives market. So, it leaves you with cash and barter. I hate to say it, but we are going to get there at some point. . . . This could happen tomorrow because of some little accident. You don’t know–like nobody knew the coronavirus was coming.”

Ackerman says he likes gold because even in deflation, debt default and destruction, “Gold will hold its value. . . . Gold is catching on now because of uncertainty and not inflation—yet.”

In closing, Ackerman says, “I still believe we are going to have a deflationary abyss to cross before we get to the hyperinflation of the mind where people realize the government’s obligation either to default on Treasury debt or not is the crux of the hyperinflation argument. Yes, at that point, I have to acknowledge the Fed can print money without limit, and they may have to.”

1169,"Trump is about to name a “vaccine czar” to run “Operation Warp Speed,” a fast-track scheme to distribute 300 million untested, unsafe vaccines across America before the end of the year. The person being named to the position is a former executive with GlaxoSmithKline, a criminal corporation that admitted to a large-scale felony bribery scheme in its $3 billion settlement with the DOJ. GSK’s bribery scheme involved 44,000 doctors and violated the laws of every state in the nation.

With no qualms about doing business with corporate felons, President Trump is now jumping in bed with Big Pharma criminals to turn the American people into human guinea pigs in order to push Big Pharma profits and try to boost the stock market in time for the November elections. And instead of choosing to work with a corporation that has no criminal record, he chose the vaccine maker that has the worst criminal record across the entire vaccine industry.

Moncef Slaoui, a former GlaxoSmithKline executive, will lead “Operation Warp Speed,” Trump’s push to accelerate the vaccine development process for COVID-19, according to an administration official. Slaoui is to serve in a volunteer capacity, and will be assisted by Army Gen. Gustave Perna, the commander of United States Army Materiel Command.

If you’re wondering why a US Army general is getting involved with the GlaxiSmithKline vaccine push, it’s because Trump has just announced he’s going to “rapidly mobilize” the US military to distribute the vaccine, according to CBS News:

“We’re mobilizing our military and other forces but we’re mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine. You know, it’s a massive job to give this vaccine. Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year we’re going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly,” the president said

It’s quite clear that Trump is describing a military-run forced vaccination program that involves mandatory injections, “to a lot of people very, very rapidly.”

Why would the US military be required to distribute a vaccine? Because, of course, the vaccine won’t be optional. President Trump is going to use the United States military to force vaccinate millions of Americans against their will. Trump has sold out America and is now going to turn the American people into live human guinea pigs for Big Pharma’s mad vaccine experiments. The entire “Operation Warp Speed” scheme is about skipping safety tests and clinical trials in order to roll out a risky, untested, unsafe vaccine that will be injected into you at gunpoint.

That’s why the military is about to be deployed across the United States to administer vaccines.

Trump has betrayed his nation and the American people. He is now an agent of Big Pharma and the anti-human rights vaccine industry that uses human children for medical experiments, all around the world.

It won’t be just any normal vaccine, either. Yesterday the Dept. of Defense issued a press release celebrating its effort to acquire 500 million “ApiJect” vaccine injection devices to be ready for the coronavirus vaccine.

As described on the ApiJect website, the ApiJect syringe features RFID tracking and GPS geo-location combined with medical data sharing with a government cloud:

With an optional RFID/NFC tag on each BFS prefilled syringe, ApiJect will make this possible. Before giving an injection, the healthcare worker will be able to launch a free mobile app and “tap” the prefilled syringe on their phone, capturing the NFC tag’s unique serial number, GPS location and date/time. The app then uploads the data to a government-selected cloud database. Aggregated injection data provides health administrators an evolving real-time “injection map.”

So the military will be “mobilized” across America to administer forced vaccines that are tagged with RFID and GPS location data, linked to your personal identification and synced with a government database that will of course be used very soon to enforce “immunity passports” and other Bill Gatesian ideas rooted in medical tyranny.

Are you getting the picture yet?

President Trump. GlaxoSmithKline. Operation Warp Speed. Big Tech censorship of “anti-vax” information. Department of Defense. Military deployment. “Injection map” tracking with GPS and RFID…

Are you getting the picture yet?

You are about to be tagged, gagged and bagged, then medically raped by an armed agent of the Trump administration. Trump has sold you out to the vaccine industry, and he’s about to roll out a medical-military dictatorship across America.

This is going to turn most of his existing base against him, by the way, which is why his odds of being re-elected are plunging by the day. We had previously estimated just a 1 in 8 chance of him winning re-election, but now we estimate a 1 in 4 chance that he will somehow find a way to cancel the elections and declare himself a military dictator, assuming power during the very “emergency” that he helped create through his own pandemic denialism and the selling out of the American people to the vaccine industry.

We are calling on Trump to declare whether these military-backed vaccines are intended to be optional or mandatory. And if Trump won’t answer the question, you can conclude they will be mandatory.

Trump is following in the footsteps of tyrannical dictators who carried out mass genocide against their own people

That means Trump is setting himself up along the lines of Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot to go down in history as a genocidal maniac who mass murdered his own people in order to appease his corporate puppet masters.

Look at the facts. The DoD announcement. The ApiJect RFID technology. The “rapid mobilization” of the US military to “distribute” the vaccines. Look at who’s running the White House coronavirus response: Dr. Fauci, the criminal at the NIH who funneled money to the Wuhan virology lab that engineered the very same bioweapon that’s now ravaging our economy and resulting in forced lockdowns.

Look at how no action has been taken against Obama, James Comey or the Clintons. Ever wonder why? Because they’re all working for the same globalist agenda.

Big Pharma has conquered the White House, and they already control the media and Big Tech. Now they’re coming for your body, and anyone who resists will likely be medically raped with a forced vaccine injection that was never subjected to rigorous clinical trials or typical safety standards.

President Trump is now all-in with Big Pharma and its globalist agenda of mass human extermination and depopulation. Have no illusions. Connect the dots. This conclusion is now inescapable, even for those of us who voted for Trump and supported him in 2016.

Trump is now an agent of Big Pharma and the vaccine industry.

Prepare to join the pro-human resistance against Trump and Big Pharma. If you allow yourself to be injected with this euthanasia vaccine, you will be killed by a subsequent infection after the Fauci / Wuhan “Covid-21” bioweapons release next year.",conspiracy,C00b7b,big.pharma; vaccine; vaccine.covid
1314,"World leaders pledged on Friday to accelerate work on tests, drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 and to share them around the globe, but the United States did not take part in the launch of the World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa were among those who joined a video conference to launch what the WHO billed as a ""landmark collaboration"" to fight the pandemic.

The aim is to speed development of safe and effective drugs, tests and vaccines to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the lung disease caused be the novel coronavirus - and ensure equal access to treatments for rich and poor.

""We are facing a common threat which we can only defeat with a common approach,"" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom

Ghebreyesus said as he opened the virtual meeting.

""Experience has told us that even when tools are available they have not been equally available to all. We cannot allow that to happen.""

During the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, there was criticism that distribution of vaccines was not equitable as wealthier countries were able to purchase more.

""We must make sure that people who need them get them,"" said Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund to Fight on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. ""The lessons from AIDS must be learned. Too many millions died before anti-retroviral medicines were made widely accessible.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the objective at a global pledging effort on May 4 would be to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.10 billion) to ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment.

""This is a first step only, but more will be needed in the future,"" von der Leyen told the conference.

Leaders from Asia, the Middle East and the Americas also joined the videoconference, but several big countries did not participate, including China, India and Russia.

A spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva had earlier told Reuters that the United States would not be involved.

""Although the United States was not in attendance at the meeting in question, there should be no doubt about our continuing determination to lead on global health matters, including the current COVID crisis,"" he said by email.

""We remain deeply concerned about the WHO's effectiveness, given that its gross failures helped fuel the current pandemic,"" he later said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted the WHO as being slow to react to the outbreak and being ""China-centric"" and announced a suspension of funding.

Tedros has steadfastly defended the WHO's handling of the pandemic and repeatedly committed to conducting a post-pandemic evaluation, as the agency does with all crises.

Macron, Merkel, Ramaphosa, and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were among those voicing strong support to WHO.

Macron urged all G7 and G20 countries to get behind the initiative, adding: ""And I hope we'll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the U.S., because this is about saying 'the fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle'.""

Merkel said: ""This concerns a global public good, to produce this vaccine and to distribute it in all parts of the world.""

Ramaphosa, chairman of the African Union, warned that the continent - with its generally poor standards of healthcare - was ""extremely vulnerable to the ravages of this virus and is in need of support"".

More than 2.7 million people have been infected with COVID-19 and nearly 190,000 have died from it since the new coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to a Reuters tally.

""As new diagnostics, treatments and vaccines become available, we have a responsibility to get them out equitably with the understanding that all lives have equal value,"" said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation, which was WHO's second largest donor last year.

More than 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI vaccine alliance, a public-private partnership that leads immunisation campaigns in poor countries.

""We need to ensure that there are enough vaccines for everyone, we are going to need global leadership to identify and prioritise vaccine candidates,"" he told a Geneva news briefing.

467,"“We’re engaged in numerous activities, but never fully devoting ourselves to focus on anything in particular,” says Franklin. Psychologists call this continuous partial attention, and it applies as much to virtual environments as it does to real ones. Think of how hard it would be to cook and read at the same time. That's the kind of multi-tasking your brain is trying, and often failing, to navigate in a group video chat.

This leads to problems in which group video chats become less collaborative and more like siloed panels, in which only two people at a time talk while the rest listen. Because each participant is using one audio stream and is aware of all the other voices, parallel conversations are impossible. If you view a single speaker at a time, you can’t recognise how non-active participants are behaving—something you would normally pick up with peripheral vision.

For some people, the prolonged split in attention creates a perplexing sense of being drained while having accomplished nothing. The brain becomes overwhelmed by unfamiliar excess stimuli while being hyper-focused on searching for non-verbal cues that it can’t find.

That’s why a traditional phone call may be less taxing on the brain, Franklin says, because it delivers on a small promise: to convey only a voice.

By contrast, the sudden shift to video calls has been a boon for people who have neurological difficulty with in-person exchanges, such as those with autism who can become overwhelmed by multiple people talking.

John Upton, an editor at the New Jersey-based news outlet Climate Central, recently found out he is autistic. Late last year, he was struggling with the mental load of attending packed conferences, engaging during in-person meetings, and navigating the small-talk that’s common in work places. He says these experiences caused “an ambiguous tension, a form of anxiety.”",mainstream,M08db0,mind.control; september.11.attack; vaccine.autism
900,"Vaccinations give protection against specific diseases, but the level of protection in a population depends on the proportion of people vaccinated.

Pathogens are microbes that cause diseases . Vaccines contain a dead or altered form of the disease-causing pathogen, which is introduced into the body. These dead or altered pathogens carry a specific antigen . This causes the immune system, specifically the white blood cells , to produce complementary antibodies , which target and attach to the antigen.

The body has two kinds of white blood cells which work together to destroy the pathogens.
• None The first kind of white blood cell makes antibodies which cause the pathogens to clump together.
• None The second type of white blood cell second destroys the pathogen by engulfing and digesting it. This process is also called

The white blood cells which make antibodies remain in the body afterwards. These are called memory cells . They enable a more rapid and larger build-up of antibodies following a second exposure to the pathogen.

During the primary infection the antibodies slowly increase, peak at around ten days and then gradually decrease. A second exposure to the same pathogen causes the white blood cells to respond quickly in order to produce lots of the relevant antibodies, which prevents infection.",mainstream,M076b9,vaccine
581,"US biotech firm Moderna reported promising early results on Monday from the first clinical tests of an experimental vaccine against the novel coronavirus performed on a small number of volunteers.

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said the vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, appeared to produce an immune response in eight people who received it similar to that seen in people convalescing from the virus.

""These interim Phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection,"" said Moderna's chief medical officer Tal Zaks.

""These data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent COVID-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials,"" Zaks said.

Moderna, which was founded nine years ago, said the vaccine ""was generally safe and well tolerated"" and that patients suffered no more than redness or soreness from the shots.

In a conference call, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said the preliminary tests inspired confidence that mRNA-1273 has ""a high probability to provide protection"" against the virus.

""We could not be happier about these interim data,"" Bancel said of the Phase 1 test, the first of three in the development of a vaccine.

Separate tests performed on mice showed that the vaccine prevented the virus from replicating in their lungs, according to the company.

The US government has invested nearly half a billion dollars in the development of Moderna's vaccine candidate.

It is being developed in a partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease headed by Anthony Fauci and the clinical test was carried out by the National Institutes of Health.

- 'As fast as safely possible' -

Three groups of 15 patients aged 18 to 55 received three different doses of the vaccine in the Phase 1 test, the complete results of which are not yet known.

The Phase 2 trial, with 600 subjects, has already received the green light from the US Food and Drug Administration and Moderna said they should begin this quarter.

A Phase 3 trial, the largest and most important to validate the efficacy of a vaccine, should begin in July.

""The Moderna team continues to focus on moving as fast as safely possible to start our pivotal Phase 3 study in July,"" said Bancel, Moderna's CEO.

Based on the Phase 1 partial results, Moderna said they would no longer study the highest dose since the lower doses appeared to provide some effect.

""The lower the dose, the more people we expect to be able to protect,"" said Moderna president Stephen Hoge.

President Donald Trump has said that he wants 300 million vaccine doses by January 2021 to protect the US population and his administration has provided funding to Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and France's Sanofi.

The development of a vaccine usually takes years but the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 315,000 deaths, has given unprecedented urgency to the search.

A dozen clinical trials are taking place around the world, half of them in China, according to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

China has said that it is carrying out tests on humans of five experimental vaccines.

The challenge is not only finding a safe and efficient vaccine but also producing billions of doses.

Several large laboratories, including Moderna, have said they would immediately begin production of an eventual vaccine even before the completion of all of the clinical trials.

977,"The number of children in Scotland receiving the MMR vaccine by five years of age has fallen slightly but remains ""very high"", official NHS figures show.

By the end of March, the three-month figure was 96.6% - down from 97%.

Uptake rates of one dose of MMR by the age of five have remained above the government's 95% target since 2009.

Scotland's chief medical officer welcomed the figures but urged teenagers heading abroad on holiday to make sure they are fully protected.

Dr Catherine Calderwood said young adults remained vulnerable to a recent global surge in measles as a result of anti-vaccine publicity in the early 2000s.

She said: ""We are pleased to see the really good statistics in Scotland once again.

""We have been over our 95% target since 2009, so the level of immunity against measles in particular in Scotland is very high.

""People seem to be wanting to come forward and have their vaccines done because they understand how important it is.""

Dr Calderwood added that an increase in measles cases around the world should not be ignored.

""There was a period of time about 15 or 20 years ago when our vaccine levels were not as good,"" she said.

""Those babies at that time are now teenagers and young adults. They may not know that they were not vaccinated or they may not have had the second dose.

""So I would really encourage them if they are travelling abroad, or attending festivals or sporting events where there are lots of people, to check out whether they have been vaccinated and that they are fully protected.""

The latest vaccination figures show more than 95% of children had received each routine immunisation by the time they were 12 months of age.
• What are vaccines, how do they work and why are people sceptical?

Uptake of rotavirus vaccine, which helps protect young children from infection that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, was 93.1% by 12 months of age.

This vaccine is given within strict age limits which, according to the NHS Scotland report, ""explains the slightly lower uptake rate compared with other vaccines offered in the first year of life"".
• By 24 months of age, 94.2% of children had received the Hib/MenC booster vaccine.
• The uptake rate for the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) booster was also 94.2%.
• Uptake of the MenB booster vaccine by 24 months has remained at 93.5%.
• Uptake of one dose of MMR vaccine by 24 months of age remained unchanged this quarter at 93.6%.

'We're now happy with the jags'

Fife teenager Jake Sykes has had his MMR vaccinations at the age of 16 after his parents decided against it when he was a baby.

His father Paul said his son's childhood allergy to nuts, eggs and dairy raised their concerns because some of the vaccines used egg proteins.

In 1998, Andrew Wakefield published a report falsely linking autism and bowel disease to the MMR vaccine.

Even though his paper was discredited and he was struck from the medical register, there was a drop in the number of children vaccinated after his claims.

Mr Sykes, from Cupar, said their fears had now been allayed.

""At the time, we were living in London and there was a fear that MMR might cause autism,"" he said.

""But that link, I think, has been disproven and now we're happy for him to get the jags.

""With the increase in cases of mumps and measles and things like that, we thought it was a good thing to get it done now.""

The NHS says vaccines work by making people produce antibodies to fight disease without actually infecting them with it.

It says the immune system of a vaccinated person who comes into contact with the disease will recognise it, and immediately produce the antibodies to fight it.

155,"On Tuesday, May 5, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order announcing that this Friday the state will move to Stage Two of his 4-stage COVID-19 “framework,” wherein reopening of “lower-risk businesses” and spaces will be allowed to reopen, to be followed by the reopening of higher-risk

 businesses and spaces in Stage Three.

Even then, Newsom reserves the right of:
• The State Public Health Officer to revise the criteria and procedures of Stage Two “as she deems necessary to respond to the dynamic threat posed by COVID19”; and of
• County and local health officers “to establish and implement public health measures within their respective jurisdictions that are more restrictive than” the statewide Stage Two policy. As an example, Newsom’s Stage Two announcement conflicts with a more restrictive mandate issued Monday in six Bay Area counties (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara) which continues to prohibit most retail businesses, except for “essential” businesses such as grocery stores, from opening through May 31. Newsom said counties can keep their more strict guidelines in place and do not have to come into compliance with the state order: “We are not telling locals that feel it’s too soon, too fast to modify.”

SFGate reports that the “lower-risk businesses” that are allowed to reopen in Stage Two include bookstores, clothing shops, sporting goods stores and flower shops, provided that (a) their local officials give approval; and (b) the businesses make changes in their operations, such as having workers wear masks. Newsom will detail the new guidelines and requirements later this week.

Dine-in restaurants and offices will be part of a “later Stage 2 opening” –whatever that means.

More disturbing still is what Newsom said at a press briefing in Sacramento yesterday — California will not return to “normal” until there is immunity from the Wuhan virus SARS-CoV-2 via a vaccine. He said:

Readers’ comments on SFGate are mostly critical of Newsom. The best comment is this one from reader “gilgotha”:

The problems with a vaccine are:
• Although by Moderna Therapeutics, a biotech company based in Cambridge, Mass., and the NIH is readying the vaccine for human testing, it could be 12 to 18 months at best before it’s ready for the public — which means California won’t return to normal until one to 1½ years from now, at best.
• The Wuhan coronavirus has already mutated into at least 30 different strains , which means whatever vaccine that is developed will not be 100% effective , just as the vaccine for the seasonal flu is, at best, only partially effective. As an example, the 2019-2020 seasonal flu vaccine is only — “effective” defined as reduction in doctor’s visits for flu illness.
• According to a new survey, one-third of Americans say they won’t get vaccinated against the Wuhan virus even if/when a vaccine becomes available. (Daily Mail)

1329,"While some have been taking advantage of coronavirus lockdowns to make banana bread or catch up on their cleaning, one British family decided to help scientists hunting for a vaccine – by becoming their human guinea pigs.

The COVID-19 pandemic left Katie Viney, her husband Tony and their daughter Rhiannon locked down at home near Oxford, England. They didn’t want to stand by and do nothing, and they could now go down in health history by all taking part in Britain’s first human trial of a potential vaccine.

""So many other people have been able to do their bit and I just thought, I'm not a nurse, I'm not a trained doctor, so this is the thing I can do,"" 19-year-old Rhiannon told Euronews.

The Vineys are among more than 1,000 healthy volunteers recruited for the trial, led by the University of Oxford. Half of the participants are getting the prototype vaccine, the others a placebo.

The British government said this week it was pumping more money into such efforts to develop a vaccine, by giving an additional 84 million pounds (€94 million) to the study underway in Oxford as well as toward a separate vaccine trial at Imperial College London.

All participants in the Oxford trial have now received their dose, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said on Sunday. If it proves a success, the government plans to roll out the vaccine to 30 million people by September.

The Vineys have been regularly taking their temperatures, keeping an eye out for any symptoms.

""We've had absolutely no side effects whatsoever, really, I can't even feel where I've had the injection. And I'm not at all worried, I've got no concerns about having this,"" said Katie.

""The hope, as with everybody, is that we find that vaccine that could let the world get back to whatever 'normal' becomes,"" said Tony. ""It's really nice to be able to volunteer for something like this, and we feel a bit honoured to be able to do that, truthfully.""

What is the vaccine being tested?

The University of Oxford announced in April that it had reached a deal with AstraZeneca that would see the pharmaceutical company manufacture and distribute the vaccine globally.

The vaccine candidate, called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees, and that was genetically modified so that it cannot develop in humans.

Further genetic material was added to make the spike protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. That spike protein, which binds to receptors on human cells, is believed to play a key role in infecting people with the new coronavirus.

As a whole, the vaccine prototype aims to make the body recognise and develop an immune response to that spike protein, to stop the coronavirus from infecting human cells.

How is it being tested?

Researchers now want to see whether the vaccine triggers an immune response to stop COVID-19 infection – and keep any side effects in check.

Volunteers are given either the coronavirus vaccine candidate or an existing vaccine against meningitis that’s used as a ‘control’ for comparison.

The meningitis vaccine is typically given to teenagers or used as a travel vaccine. The reason for selecting it rather than saline water, for instance, is because scientists expect the coronavirus vaccine to cause some small side effects such as a sore arm, headache and fever. If they used saline, which would cause no such side effects, they fear participants would automatically know whether they were given the new vaccine or the placebo.

""It is critical for this study that participants remain blinded to whether or not they have received the vaccine, as, if they knew, this could affect their health behaviour in the community following vaccination, and may lead to a bias in the results of the study,"" the university explains.

When will we know whether or not it works?

To assess whether the vaccine protects from COVID-19, scientists will compare the number of infections in the control group with the number of infections in the vaccinated group.

The trial therefore relies on some participants developing COVID-19. And how quickly they get infected and transmit the disease will influence how quickly the trial will yield results. The team expects to collect enough data within six months at most.

If the results are encouraging, late-stage trials of the vaccine's effectiveness could take place in the second half of this year. That's much faster than usual procedures, which usually take several years.

If the vaccine doesn’t show positive results in the first phase, the university could decide to change dosing or stop the trial altogether.

Getting a vaccine to market usually takes years, not months, and some experts have warned that the magic bullet against COVID-19 may never be found.

With no guarantee of success on a vaccine, Oxford University is also leading what it describes as the world's biggest treatment trial. HIV and anti-malarial drugs, as well as an antibiotic, are among those being tested on COVID-19 patients.

Professor Richard Haynes, who coordinates the Recovery clinical trial at the University of Oxford, says it’s important to continue hunting for effective treatments too, as “some people will end up in hospital even when we have a vaccine.”

“Over the past eight weeks, we've now recruited over 10,000 people from over 180 different hospitals. We're testing lots of different treatments and at the moment it's too early to say whether any of them are beneficial or not. We won't know. But hopefully, we'll get some answers over the summer,"" he said.

582,"What Is the Immune System?

The immune system is the body's defense against infections. The immune (ih-MYOON) system attacks germs and helps keep us healthy.

What Are the Parts of the Immune System?

Many cells and organs work together to protect the body. White blood cells, also called leukocytes (LOO-kuh-sytes), play an important role in the immune system.

Some types of white blood cells, called phagocytes (FAH-guh-sytes), chew up invading organisms. Others, called lymphocytes (LIM-fuh-sytes), help the body remember the invaders and destroy them.

One type of phagocyte is the neutrophil (NOO-truh-fil), which fights bacteria. When someone might have bacterial infection, doctors can order a blood test to see if it caused the body to have lots of neutrophils. Other types of phagocytes do their own jobs to make sure that the body responds to invaders.

The two kinds of lymphocytes are B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes start out in the bone marrow and either stay there and mature into B cells, or go to the thymus gland to mature into T cells. B lymphocytes are like the body's military intelligence system — they find their targets and send defenses to lock onto them. T cells are like the soldiers — they destroy the invaders that the intelligence system finds.

How Does the Immune System Work?

When the body senses foreign substances (called antigens), the immune system works to recognize the antigens and get rid of them.

B lymphocytes are triggered to make antibodies (also called immunoglobulins). These proteins lock onto specific antigens. After they're made, antibodies usually stay in our bodies in case we have to fight the same germ again. That's why someone who gets sick with a disease, like chickenpox, usually won't get sick from it again.

This is also how immunizations (vaccines) prevent some diseases. An immunization introduces the body to an antigen in a way that doesn't make someone sick. But it does let the body make antibodies that will protect the person from future attack by the germ.

Although antibodies can recognize an antigen and lock onto it, they can't destroy it without help. That's the job of the T cells. They destroy antigens tagged by antibodies or cells that are infected or somehow changed. (Some T cells are actually called ""killer cells."") T cells also help signal other cells (like phagocytes) to do their jobs.
• neutralize toxins (poisonous or damaging substances) produced by different organisms
• activate a group of proteins called complement that are part of the immune system. Complement helps kill bacteria, viruses, or infected cells.

These specialized cells and parts of the immune system offer the body protection against disease. This protection is called immunity.

Humans have three types of immunity — innate, adaptive, and passive:
• Innate immunity: Everyone is born with innate (or natural) immunity, a type of general protection. For example, the skin acts as a barrier to block germs from entering the body. And the immune system recognizes when certain invaders are foreign and could be dangerous.
• Adaptive immunity: Adaptive (or active) immunity develops throughout our lives. We develop adaptive immunity when we're exposed to diseases or when we're immunized against them with vaccines.
• Passive immunity: Passive immunity is ""borrowed"" from another source and it lasts for a short time. For example, antibodies in a mother's breast milk give a baby temporary immunity to diseases the mother has been exposed to.

The immune system takes a while to develop and needs help from vaccines. By getting all your child's recommended vaccines on time, you can help keep your child as healthy as possible.",mainstream,M0a185,vaccine.covid
1134,"There are three known serotypes (closely related though distinguishable forms) of wild poliovirus: PV1 , PV2, and PV3. The most-widespread serotype is PV1. PV2 likely has been eradicated; the last PV2 case was reported in 1999 in Uttar Pradesh , India . The third serotype, PV3, is close to eradication.

Polio , in full poliomyelitis , also called infantile paralysis , acute viral infectious disease of the nervous system that usually begins with general symptoms such as fever , headache , nausea , fatigue , and muscle pains and spasms and is sometimes followed by a more-serious and permanent paralysis of muscles in one or more limbs, the throat , or the chest. More than half of all cases of polio occur in children under the age of five. The paralysis so commonly associated with the disease actually affects fewer than 1 percent of persons infected by the poliovirus. Between 5 and 10 percent of infected persons display only the general symptoms outlined above, and more than 90 percent show no signs of illness at all. For those infected by the poliovirus, there is no cure, and in the mid-20th century hundreds of thousands of children were struck by the disease every year. Since the 1960s, thanks to widespread use of polio vaccines, polio has been eliminated from most of the world. It is now endemic in only three countries: Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Nigeria . Nigeria, however, was on the brink of being polio-free in 2015. Worldwide, since 1988 the number of reported polio cases has dropped by more than 99 percent.

The course of the disease

Poliomyelitis means “gray marrow inflammation,” referring to the propensity of the poliovirus to attack certain cells in the spinal cord and brainstem. The poliovirus is a picornavirus (family Picornaviridae), a member of a group known as enteroviruses that inhabits the human digestive tract. (Human beings are the only known hosts of the poliovirus.) The virus enters the body most often by the so-called fecal–oral route—that is, from fecal matter taken into the mouth through contaminated food or fingers. It can also enter by ingestion of droplets expelled from the throat of an infected person. New victims may become ill about 7 to 14 days after ingesting the virus. Infected persons may shed the virus from their throats for a week, beginning a day or more before suffering any symptoms themselves, and they may continue to shed the virus in their feces for a month or more after their illness.

After the poliovirus is swallowed, it multiplies in lymph nodes of the intestinal tract and spreads through the body via the bloodstream. In some people the virus gets no farther, causing only a vague flulike illness to develop. The most-common early symptoms of polio are mild headache, fever, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, and drowsiness. Fever peaks in two to three days and then rapidly subsides, and patients recover within three to four days without the development of paralysis.

In some cases, however, the virus begins an assault on the central nervous system, inflaming and destroying motor cells of the spinal cord and brainstem. In those cases patients become irritable and develop pain in the back and limbs, muscle tenderness, and stiff neck. Many recover at that stage, but approximately 1 in 200 persons with polio develops what is known as flaccid paralysis. The motor impulses that normally move along the nerve fibres from the spinal cord to muscles are blocked, and, as a result, muscles become limp and cannot contract. The extent of paralysis depends on where the virus strikes and the number of nerve cells that it destroys. Cells that are not severely injured recover their normal function in time; to the extent that they do recover, a corresponding restoration of muscle function may be expected. Cells that are destroyed, however, are not replaced, because nerve cells cannot regenerate. In that case the paralysis is complete and permanent, with associated progressive atrophy of the unused muscles.

In most cases paralytic polio strikes the limb muscles, particularly the legs. Paralysis does not always involve the limbs, however. The abdominal muscles or the muscles of the back may be paralyzed, affecting posture. The neck muscles may become weak, so that the head cannot be raised. Paralysis of the face muscles may cause twisting of the mouth or drooping eyelids. In some types of spinal polio, the virus damages the upper part of the spinal cord, with resulting difficulties in breathing. In bulbar polio the virus attacks the brainstem, and the nerve centres that control swallowing and talking are damaged. Secretions collect in the throat and may lead to suffocation by blocking the airway. Some 5 to 10 percent of persons afflicted with paralytic polio die, usually of respiratory complications.

There seem to be individual differences in the degree of natural susceptibility to the disease. Many persons have acquired antibodies to the poliovirus in their blood without having had any symptoms of infection. It is generally held that a lasting immunity follows recovery from the disease. However, because there are three different serotypes of poliovirus, second attacks can occur. Persons who recover from an infection caused by one serotype of poliovirus are permanently immune to reinfection by that serotype but not to infection by the others. For that reason polio vaccines are trivalent—that is, designed to generate antibodies to all three poliovirus serotypes (see below).

Among as many as one-quarter of former polio victims whose condition has been stabilized for years or even decades, a condition called post-polio syndrome has been recognized. Post-polio syndrome manifests itself as increased weakness, muscle atrophy, or other conditions involving the originally affected muscle groups or a different group of muscles. The cause of the syndrome is not known for certain, but it may arise when nerve branches grown by nerve fibres that survived the original infection begin to deteriorate as the former polio victim passes through middle age. There is no cure for post-polio syndrome.",mainstream,M0b366,vaccine.covid
904,"Trials of experimental coronavirus vaccines are already under way, but it’s still likely to be years before one is ready and vaccination may not even be possible

MANY UK newspapers recently celebrated the first volunteer to receive an injection as part of a safety trial of an experimental coronavirus vaccine. But while there are claims that it could be possible for a vaccine to be ready within a year, the chances of this happening remain slim.

The UK trial, led by the University of Oxford, will ultimately involve 1100 adults, half of whom will receive the experimental vaccine. The other half will get a meningitis vaccine as a control. The team behind the trial hopes to move on to tests to gauge how effective the vaccine is against the coronavirus as early as August, raising hopes that a vaccine could be ready before the end of the year, and that this could be the answer to the difficult question of how the country gets out of strict social distancing measures.

Unfortunately, these hopes are probably misplaced. Vaccine design expert Maria Bottazzi of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, calls the schedule “unrealistic”. Even if everything goes according to plan in the first phase of trials, Bottazzi points out that researchers will still need time to determine how well the vaccine protects people from covid-19 and whether it provokes any side effects when a vaccinated person is subsequently exposed to the virus.

It is far from guaranteed that the vaccine will be safe and effective. 2013 study calculated that, before entering clinical trials, the average experimental vaccine has a 6 per cent chance of ultimately reaching the market. Of those that make it into trials, a 2019 analysis suggests the probability of success is 33.4 per cent.

But even if the Oxford vaccine succeeds, there will then be the issue of scaling up manufacturing to make hundreds of millions of doses. According to Bottazzi, this is the real bottleneck. Under the best of circumstances, the world is still looking at 12 to 18 months before a vaccine could be widely available, she says.

That in itself would be a remarkable achievement. The 2013 study found that between 1998 and 2009, the average time taken to develop a vaccine was 10.7 years. It is possible to speed this up to some extent – since then, an Ebola vaccine has become the fastest-developed vaccine ever, being produced in just five years.

But to lower this to just 18 months would require the next steps of the development process to be begun before the previous ones were completed, Bottazzi says. This increases the risk of significant loss of investment should the vaccine fail to pan out, as well as raising questions about safety. An expedited path from early trials to scaled-up manufacturing would mean that researchers won’t have as much time to study the long-term effects of a vaccine in trial participants before it is given to the public, for example.

“Between 1998 and 2009, the average time taken to develop a vaccine was 10.7 years”

To try to speed things up, on 21 April, UK health minister Matt Hancock said that the government will put money into manufacturing capability, in the hope that either the Oxford vaccine, or another vaccine being tested by Imperial College London, will prove successful. Similar measures are being taken elsewhere. US philanthropist Bill Gates has announced he is helping to build manufacturing capability for seven candidate vaccines – a strategy he said will lose billions of dollars but save time.

More than 100 vaccines for the coronavirus are currently in various early stages of development. The more that are tested, the higher the chances of finding something that is both safe and effective.

Yet there is no guarantee that it is even possible to vaccinate against the coronavirus. There is a lot we don’t know yet about how our immune systems respond to the virus, and whether it is possible to induce long-lasting immunity to it.

Hancock also said that the government is “throwing everything” at developing a coronavirus vaccine. But given the time it will take to get one – if it even proves possible to do so – it is clear that countries can’t wait for a vaccine to get them out of their current crises. As epidemiologist Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh, UK, told New Scientist in early April: “I do not think waiting for a vaccine should be dignified with the word ‘strategy’. It’s not a strategy, it’s a hope.”

We need to be realistic about the hopes of a vaccine, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth trying. Like annual flu vaccines, an effective coronavirus vaccine could help us protect those most at risk from the virus. As with childhood vaccines for measles and other diseases, it may also enable us to protect future generations from covid-19.

But it could be years before we have a vaccine. Until then, we will need to deal with multiple waves of infection with measures such as extensive testing, contact tracing and quarantining.",mainstream,M088b4,vaccine.covid
346,"The vaccine expert cautioned that the drug was not a complete ""knockout"" in the study — the first randomized clinical trial to deliver results on a potential coronavirus drug. But he said the findings are significant because ""what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.""

President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly touted unproven coronavirus drugs at White House briefings, was more upbeat about the trial results. ""It's a very positive event,"" he said.

Trial participants who received remdesivir recovered in an average of 11 days compared with 15 days for patients in the control group, who received a placebo. Eight percent of remdesivir patients died during the trial versus 11 percent in the placebo group.

The death rate is just slightly lower in the remdesivir group, but more data remains to be analyzed, Fauci said. But the scientist, who has led NIAID since 1984, said the news reminded him of the day 34 years ago when modest results for the drug AZT signaled the first potential weapon against HIV.

""That was not the end game, because building on that every year after we did better and better, we had better drugs of the same type, and we had drugs against different targets,"" Fauci said.

AZT, or azidothymidine, was originally developed as a cancer drug. In March 1987, it won FDA approval — in record time — for use against HIV, at a time when infection often led to a quick and painful death.

The medicine came with rough side effects, and questions about whether it actually extended life. It took another decade before scientists developed the combination antiretroviral drugs that transformed HIV into a chronic disease.

Scientists around the world have been racing to find coronavirus treatments, but no drug has been definitively proven effective.

Other early data for remdesivir have been mixed, including a pair of studies whose results were released hours ahead of the NIAID findings.

Gilead released its own study results this morning suggesting that severely ill patients receiving five days of remdesivir fared just as well as patients receiving a 10-day dosing regimen. More than half of both dosing groups were discharged from the hospital within two weeks of beginning their medication.

Eight percent of people in the five-day group died while 11 percent in the 10-day group died. But another 10 percent in the longer dosing arm had to discontinue treatment because of serious side effects, and the study lacked a control group.

Gilead said the data also suggests that people who received remdesivir early in their infection seemed to fare better than those that received it later. The study is not a traditional trial with a placebo arm to compare against remdesivir for effectiveness, earning Gilead some criticism from policy experts over sharing the news alongside the NIAID results.

""Piggybacking the severe trial release on [the NIAID study] is the part which is unjustifiable,"" said Peter Bach, director of Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Center for Health Policy and Outcomes. Calling Gilead's results positive even though they came from a trial without a control group ""has no basis in scientific inquiry,"" he added.

The Lancet medical journal responded to Gilead's news this morning by rushing to publish the inconclusive results from a Chinese trial accidentally leaked last week by the World Health Organization.",mainstream,M08a7d,vaccine
585,"As the measles outbreak spreads across the country, tens of thousands of children remain in a paperwork limbo — unsure whether they are fully vaccinated, a big unknown in assessing the risk at many schools.

A USA TODAY analysis of school vaccination records found that at more than 2,200 public and private schools in 12 states, at least a tenth of kindergarten students had either incomplete vaccination records or had fallen behind schedule in receiving their shots.

In some cases, schools dismiss that as a documentation problem, pointing out that many students have had at least one shot.

""You have to have all that information before you can start the work of controlling the outbreak,"" says Shoana Anderson, director of communicable disease and emergency preparedness for Nashville's Department of Public Health. ""The amount of staff time and work that it takes to gather that is incredible. And with diseases, you don't often have awhile.""

As an epidemiologist, she spent three months in 2008 trying to contain a measles outbreak in Tuscon.

In that outbreak, which centered around two hospitals and entered at least one school, half the 14 confirmed cases were in people with unknown immunization status.

Hundreds of hospital workers and a handful of schoolchildren who may have had contact with the patients couldn't provide proof of immunization — meaning workers had to be sent home and students kept out of school for as long as 18 days. The outbreak cost the hospitals nearly $800,000 and 15,000 lost hours of work, mostly because of furloughs, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. Among those who weren't sure of their vaccination status, about 10% were found to have no immunity.

""Most of the time, it doesn't impact you — these cases are so rare that you might never face the situation,"" Anderson says. ""But when it does happen, it has a pretty big impact.""

Students arrive at school without their shots for lots of reasons. In low-income neighborhoods, access to doctors has long been an issue. Newly arrived immigrants often appear without proof of immunization or with a spotty history of vaccinations. In some cases, parents scared of their children receiving more shots have decided to slow or stop the vaccination schedule. Anderson said lost or missing records can be a huge problem if parents change doctors or move.

Nearly 270 of the schools with the highest incomplete record rates were in Los Angeles' Unified School District. At a handful of schools with the most extreme cases, as many as nine out of every 10 children begin kindergarten under the state's conditional entry program for students missing some vaccines or their immunization paperwork.

""I know that sounds alarming,"" says Tonya Ross, the district's director of nursing, but she points out that conditional students in most cases have received at least some of their immunizations and that even if students receive one measles shot — instead of the recommended two — they still have 95% immunity.

Despite an outbreak of measles that began at nearby Disneyland, not a single case has appeared among students in the district's schools, she says.

""Even most of our students who have exemptions have some immunizations,"" she says. ""The kids are for the most part protected.""

Whether they — or any of the children across the country whose vaccination status is recorded as ""incomplete"" or ""conditional"" — ever get fully caught up on vaccines is less clear.

In Virginia, 104 schools have conditional entry rates above 10%. Parents have 90 days to get their children caught up, state epidemiologist Sandra Sommer says.

Sommer's office doesn't track or follow up on the conditional enrollment figures provided by each school, she says. More than half the schools with high conditional enrollment are in Northern Virginia's Fairfax health district, but only a ""low"" number of students have been taken out of school for failure to comply with the law.

Los Angeles school district officials couldn't say how many students had been taken out of school for not completing their vaccinations.

""That's always a last resort,"" Ross says. ""We want all kids to be in school.""

Epidemiologist Saad Omer of Emory University's Vaccine Center said his research had shown that many students who fall behind on immunizations never catch up.

""We do know that some parents eventually complete, but a majority of them don't,"" he says.

To look at the issue of incomplete records, USA TODAY analyzed immunization data collected from more than 42,000 public and private schools in 25 states across the country. Half the states don't require schools to report incomplete cases — Massachusetts, Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Arizona are among those. Some track the matter internally — Illinois law dictates that each school must keep a list of all students who aren't fully vaccinated.

In Arizona, state law says students without proof of all vaccinations are required to stay home during outbreak incidents. This year, unvaccinated students at two California high schools — in Huntington Beach and Palm Desert — were told to stay home after measles cases were diagnosed.

Starting in April, California's Oakland Unified School district won't allow students to attend school unless they have all their vaccines on file or have an exemption. The district has 40 schools that had conditional entry rates over 10% at the beginning of the school year.

Spokesman Troy Flint says those numbers are mostly because of untrained staff and spotty internal record keeping. Last week, the district trained employees how to properly report and follow up on vaccinations.

""I've seen this happen in schools where you do the training, and the vaccine rate goes from 20% to 90%, it was all just clerical error,"" he says.

Ross says her district works to see that students receive all their shots. School administrators pass pamphlets to parents about public health and school-based clinics. In areas where students often don't regularly see a doctor, school nurses host vaccine clinics. Nurses use the state's immunization registry to check whether proof of immunization for students has ever been entered in another city.

""We do hear a lot about that it's a burden for schools to monitor this information,"" says Shannon Stokley, associate director for science at the CDC""s immunization services division. ""But it's in their best interest, so they know their children are protected.""

1121,"New York, NY (UPI) -- U.S. and Chinese scientists have discovered that a proposed SARS vaccine triggers an autoimmune response causing the body to attack itself. Using new tools called glycan microarrays -- which can examine cell chemistry at extremely small scales -- scientists at Columbia University in New York and Sun Yat-sen University in China studied a vaccine made from an inactivated SARS-coronavirus. They found the antibodies the body created to fight the intentionally weak infection also attacked a particular glycoprotein, a molecule of linked protein and sugar, that is very common in the human system. ""These observations raise concerns on human use of the whole virus-based SARS vaccine that is produced by the monkey Vero E6 cell,"" the scientists said. The cell line used was produced by monkey Vero E6 cells. Based on the results, the scientists said it is too risky at the moment to introduce a whole-viral SARS vaccine to human subjects, but choosing an alternative cell line or genetically modifying the Vero E6 cell line might fix the problem.",conspiracy,C00e0d,vaccine.covid
196,"When a coronavirus vaccine becomes available in the United States, the federal government and states will face a crucial choice: Should all or most residents be required to get the vaccine?

Or should it be required only for school children, with a medical exception allowed, and for groups like front-line health-care workers? Some officials might want few or no requirements at all because they think enough people will get the vaccine voluntarily or have immunity from an infection to halt the spread of the disease.

But in states like Oklahoma, efforts to require and promote the vaccine could run into strong headwinds.

Anti-vaccine activists are vocal and influential in the state, spurred on by a national movement. It’s one reason Oklahoma is one of only 15 states, including Texas and Arkansas, that allow parents to cite personal reasons to exempt their children from immunizations required by schools and day-care centers. They fill out and turn in a form. All states grant exemptions for medical reasons, and 45 states plus Washington, D.C., allow exemptions for religious objections.

Vaccine skeptics have successfully fought off efforts in the Legislature and state government to tighten exemptions. Just this year, a state advisory committee proposed requiring parents who opt out of vaccinations for their children for religious or personal reasons to first attend a vaccine education session at their local health department. It also proposed that exemptions expire after sixth grade unless parents renew them. Both failed to advance.

A key reason driving proposals like these is Oklahoma’s rising numbers and rates of exemptions. In 2018-19, the overall exemption rate for all kindergarteners was 2.6%, up from 2.2% in 2017-18 and 1.9% in 2016-17, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. In 2009-10, the exemption rate was 1.1%. The number of approved vaccine exemptions doubled from 2,417 in 2014 to 5,082 in 2019.

Liza Greve, executive director of the Oklahomans for Health and Parental Rights Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes what is often called vaccine choice or health freedom, said she believes there’s a good chance Oklahoma will add a COVID-19 vaccine to its vaccination schedule for children, and health-care workers will be required to take it. But her organization will advocate for an individual’s right to choose.

“Whatever shakes out, Oklahomans need to have a choice in vaccination and treatment,” she said, citing concerns that rapid development of a COVID-19 vaccine will heighten risks of adverse reactions.

Dr. Ervin Yen, an Oklahoma City anesthesiologist who advocated for stronger immunization policies during his four years in the Oklahoma Senate, said he thinks the federal government should require the vaccine for all citizens because of how deadly and contagious the disease is. But he believes the decision will be left up to the states.

“I think a significant number of states will mandate it, and I think Oklahoma will have to consider it,” Yen said.

Oklahoma requires children entering school to be vaccinated for nine diseases, including measles, chickenpox and polio. Parents can apply for exemptions on medical, religious or personal grounds. Medical exemptions represent the smallest share of school exemptions in the state.

House Majority Floor Leader Jon Echols, R-Oklahoma City, anticipates the state health department would update the vaccination schedule for children to include COVID-19 once a safe and effective vaccine is available and the Legislature would approve it as long as parents could apply for the same exemptions.

“I think it would be widely used,” Echols said. “I would take it.”

But a general requirement to be vaccinated would not fly, Echols said. “There’s no chance of the Oklahoma Legislature passing a People’s Republic of China mandate,” he said.

Nationwide nearly half the states require young adults be vaccinated against meningococcal disease before heading to college, and 15 states also require the hepatitis B vaccine.

But unlike policies for children, few requirements exist for adult immunizations in the U.S. and little public health infrastructure supports mass vaccination of adults, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Doctors and scientists say every vaccine has an adverse reaction rate. For the measles vaccine, it is one per 1 million people vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization. “But you save 40 to 50 people (per million) from dying,” Yen said.

The benefits of the eventual COVID-19 vaccine will “hugely outweigh the risks,” he said. “Coronavirus is way deadlier than measles.” Even if the death rate turns out to be only 1%, a vaccine given to 1 million people would save 10,000 lives, Yen said.

Scientists across the globe are fast-tracking development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 118 candidate vaccines in the works, the World Health Organization reports. Of those, eight are in clinical or human trials and 110 are not yet being tested on humans.

It’s not clear when a safe and effective vaccine would be developed and available for distribution. Predictions have ranged from 12 or 18 months to at least a few years out, and residents in developed countries, or ones that originate a successful vaccine, could gain vaccine immunity first, while more impoverished countries wait.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is streamlining its processes for coronavirus vaccines and therapeutic treatments.

“The FDA is going to rush it through,” said William Hildebrand, a research professor at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine who is among the many scientists worldwide working to create a vaccine. “The public is demanding it.”

Hildebrand’s team is looking at using the body’s protective T-cells to find and kill virus-infected cells, rather than developing a vaccine that helps the body produce antibodies. It’s a long shot, he said.

“Everybody’s odds are a little long (individually), but collectively our odds are pretty good,” Hildebrand said. “The odds are pretty good the scientific community is going to come up with something that will stop this virus.”

For a vaccine to stop the spread of an infectious disease, a sufficiently high number of people must be immune to the disease. That provides indirect protection, or herd immunity, to those who aren’t vaccinated or who have compromised immune systems and are at greater risk of catching an infection, including babies, older adults or people with certain medical conditions.

Herd immunity for each disease is based on how many additional cases each infected person will cause during their infectious period. One person with measles, for example, will infect 12 to 18 others, so, based on a complex calculation, 90% of the population needs to be vaccinated to ensure the disease does not spread.

In the case of COVID-19, the science shows an infected person will pass it along to about three others, meaning about 70% of the population will need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity, said Gary Raskob, dean of the OU College of Public Health.

An analysis by the Journal of Infection in mid-March estimated that the percentage of a population that must be immune via vaccination or natural immunity to halt the spread of COVID-19 varies by country. In Kuwait, it’s less than 6%; in Japan, 33%, and in Spain, 81%. The percentages are based on R-naught values, the epidemiological number for the reproduction rate of the virus.

“The vaccine will be crucial,” Raskob said. “We have to get the public to understand the importance of vaccination.”

Public acceptance likely will be better than for the measles vaccine, he said. “Since measles was eradicated, many people have never seen a case of measles, even most physicians practicing today,” Raskob said.

Not so with COVID-19. People are reminded daily of the severe and fatal effects of the disease and many people have personal experience with it. People are likely to be waiting in line as production scales up once the FDA approves a vaccine, he said.

If there’s not enough vaccine to meet the initial demand, it would likely go first to health-care workers and then the most vulnerable population, Raskob said. Hospitals and long-term care facilities will have the ability to require that employees be vaccinated over any personal objections, he said.

Oklahoma law currently requires hospital employees to provide documentation of immunity to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. Several hospitals have adopted the Oklahoma Hospital Association policy that supports mandatory employee influenza vaccinations as a condition of employment in hospitals.

‘We Have to Proceed With Caution’

Amid the quest for a coronavirus vaccine, suspicion gathers among networks and groups that object to many proven vaccines and vaccination requirements.

A study published this week in the science journal Nature found nearly 100 million people expressing views on vaccination on Facebook and concluded the explosive growth in anti-vaccination views could increase opposition to a future COVID vaccine and “amplify outbreaks, as happened for measles in 2019.”

The Oklahomans for Health and Parental Rights political action committee, which contributes to state legislative campaigns, says vaccines have been linked to chronic childhood conditions, including autism, asthma, diabetes and obesity. Claims like these are made by other anti-vaccination groups despite research to the contrary showing vaccines are generally safe.

Greve, who leads the PAC as well as the nonprofit advocacy group, said supporters are following the COVID-19 vaccine news and keeping an eye on safety and efficacy studies.

“Sometimes in an emergency situation, corners are cut when they shouldn’t be,” Greve said. “The evolving science is moving very quickly. When it comes to a vaccine, we have to proceed with caution.”

One concern is the risk of immune enhancement, in which a vaccine actually weakens a person’s response to the virus so the person becomes sicker, Greve said.

An example occurred when an investigational vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) backfired in the 1960s. In one study, the hospitalization rate of infants who were vaccinated approached 80% compared to 5% for those not vaccinated, and two toddlers died, according to the National Institutes of Health’s National Library of Medicine.

Greve’s advocacy group supported a dozen vaccine-related bills filed this legislative session, including efforts to protect personal exemptions and establish a stronger tracking system for reporting any injuries or deaths from vaccinations.

Hildebrand, of the OU College of Medicine, said multiple studies are underway to provide the answers scientists need to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine in record time. He said the rush to discover a vaccine means the result could carry a greater risk of serious reaction than normal.

“This one might be more relaxed or liberal in its acceptable adverse reaction rate,” he said.

When the vaccine is available, he said, people will have to ask themselves what’s riskier, the odds of an adverse reaction or the danger of getting the disease.

56,"Crises create the opportunity for leaders to provide direction, meaning, and support when followers need it the most. One way for leaders to earn their followers’ trust in a crisis is through self sacrifice–either through their own giving or that of the organization. The author’s research shows that when leaders sacrifice in this way, it makes employees feel more positively toward them and more committed to their organizations. But to reap the benefits, leaders must give with purpose, and be transparent about why and how much they are giving.

You might think that crises tend to bring out the worst in people, but that isn’t reflected in how we view our leaders, at least. In fact, crises cause us to view leaders as more charismatic and effective than we normally do. This is probably why U.S. presidents are almost universally re-elected in times of war. And research has shown that leaders who self-sacrifice tend to be seen as the most effective.

Following 9/11, I was so intrigued by crisis leadership that I did a study on the topic. In my research I found that leader self-sacrifice, such as cutting one’s own salary or giving up one’s own benefits, caused employees to feel more positively toward their leaders and more committed to their organizations during crises. This finding has been corroborated by additional research in the lab and field that suggests that when leaders demonstrate self-sacrificial behavior, it makes us see them as having higher moral values and as being a better role model — leading to better organizational outcomes.

More recently, we have seen CEOs step up to support their employees during this pandemic by pledging not to lay off employees —even those who cannot go into work. For example, even though all of Patagonia’s stores are closed, CEO Yvon Chouinard has announced that the company will continue to pay all employees, leading some to conclude that the values-driven organization will survive the pandemic while other organizations will fail. Other CEOs who have committed to no layoffs include Hearst CEO Steven Swartz, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Visa CEO Alfred F. Kelly Jr., and FedEx CEO Frederick Smith, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins.

So, what can leaders do in this time to support their employees and how can they be sure that their giving hits the mark? Effective measures fall into three categories: taking some of the same hits as your staff; giving with a larger purpose in mind; and being aggressively transparent even when it’s hard.

Self-sacrifice is not just about the company doing what’s right. If you are going to ask your employees to sacrifice, you need to sacrifice as well. If you expect your team to behave safely, you as a leader should behave safely. If you expect your team to get down in the trenches, you should be down there with them. No one likes the leader who throws their team on the front line while they sit in their office.

Marriott International CEO Arne Sorenson, forfeited his salary for the year and is donating hotel rooms to front-line workers to help fight Covid-19. Marriot also asked its executives to sacrifice half of their salaries and has been furloughed many other employees. As a result, Marriot is still viewed – at least in the media — as an employer of choice despite its need to furlough employees.

Other companies whose top leaders have cut their salaries include NBCUniversal, Uber, Delta, and Yelp. In my own field of academia, highly paid deans, coaches, and administrators at top universities like Harvard are taking pay cuts to help make up for the impending deficits that higher education is facing. Even world leaders, like Jacinda Arden, New Zealand’s prime minister, are taking pay cuts.

Not all of us are CEOs who can make the decision to keep people’s paychecks coming or give up our salary for a year. But there are still ways to sacrifice for our employees. Small gestures like ordering lunch to be sent remotely to your employees for a team zoom meeting can go a long way at maintaining the morale of the team. If your organization has a leave donation program, you can donate some of your time off to your team members who need it.

When you’re a leader, sacrificing along with your employees could mean that they will be more committed to staying with the company during and after the crisis. And, considering the cost of employee turnover, this could mean the difference between recovering from the Covid-19 crisis — or not.

Many organizations are offering free services like free virtual tours or free learning tools for kids. Likewise, we have seen organizations step up to help provide resources needed to combat the effects of the pandemic. Tesla, Toyota, Ford and GM have shut down factories to make ventilators while Medtronic openly shared the software and specifications for their portable ventilators, allowing anyone to use them for free to help create ventilators in response to Covid-19.

But, whatever the give, it is important to tie the sacrifice to vision, mission, and the values of your organization so that people can understand why you are doing it. When Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff pledged not to do any layoffs for the next three months, he tied it to the cultural value of Ohana (family) and giving, asking that employees also continue to support the people they relied on before the crisis, such as house cleaners or dog walkers. Leaders should be clear about how their actions are consistent with the organization’s values.

If that purpose isn’t clear, there can be backlash. Research shows that we are a skeptical bunch and when leaders self-sacrifice, we try to infer why the leader might be doing it or focus on what they are not doing (like whether or not the leaders are keeping their bonuses). The more cynical among us might infer that Johnson & Johnson’s decision to invest a billion dollars to develop a Covid-19 vaccine was driven by profit. But, when CEO Alex Gorsky tied the act to their responsibility to improve the health of people and they announced that they would provide the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis, the doubt turns to admiration.

In addition to explaining why they are making a sacrifice, leaders should be transparent about what that sacrifice amounts to. If a leader publicly donates 10% of her salary to a nonprofit, she should explain what the nonprofit is and what exactly is happening to the money.

For example, Jack Dorsey is donating $1 billion of his Square equity (28% of his wealth) to fund Covid-19 relief. Not only is he giving away the money; he also shared a Google Doc showing how the funds would be spent.

Voluntary transparency becomes key in this situation. Disney’s CEO Bob Chapek is forgoing 50% of his salary and other benefits as a result of Covid-19. But this decision came after pressure from the union for some information from leadership over concerns about the closing of Disney parks.

Even when we are not in a crisis, 84% of employees think organizations are not doing enough to create transparency. But this comes at a cost to the organization. One study showed that organizations that were more transparent had higher productivity, innovation, and retention than those that were more opaque. In contrast, increasing transparency can in fact build trust.

Crises create the opportunity for leaders to provide direction, meaning, and support when followers need it the most. Learning that Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle reduced his salary to $10,000 while continuing to pay its employees or that Yum Brands CEO, David Gibbs, gave up his salary and gave $1,000 bonuses to the managers of his restaurants does more than lift the spirits of their employees. These various strains of research indicate that this type of sacrifice can improve morale and trust for the rest of us, and ease the pain the rest of us are feeling in this time.",mainstream,M07c2f,vaccine; vaccine.covid
65,"Only half of Americans say they would get a COVID-19 vaccine, AP-NORC poll shows

Only about half of Americans say they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if the scientists working furiously to create one succeed, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

That’s surprisingly low considering the effort going into the global race for a vaccine against the coronavirus that has sparked a pandemic since it emerged from China late last year. But more people might eventually roll up their sleeves: The poll, released Wednesday, found 31% simply weren’t sure if they’d get vaccinated. Another 1 in 5 said they’d refuse.

Health experts already worry about the whiplash if vaccine promises like President Donald Trump’s goal of a 300 million-dose stockpile by January fail. Only time and science will tell – and the new poll shows the public is indeed skeptical.

“It’s always better to underpromise and overdeliver,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

“The unexpected looms large and that’s why I think for any of these vaccines, we’re going to need a large safety database to provide the reassurance,” he added.

Coronavirus live updates: Food prices poised to jump; half of Americans not sure they want vaccine; US deaths near 100K

Among Americans who say they wouldn’t get vaccinated, 7 in 10 worry about safety.

“I am not an anti-vaxxer,” said Melanie Dries, 56, of Colorado Springs, Colorado. But “to get a COVID-19 vaccine within a year or two ... causes me to fear that it won’t be widely tested as to side effects.”

Dr. Francis Collins, who directs the National Institutes of Health, insists safety is the top priority. The NIH is creating a master plan for testing the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates in tens of thousands of people, to prove whether they work and whether they’re safe.

“I would not want people to think that we’re cutting corners, because that would be a big mistake. I think this is an effort to try to achieve efficiencies, but not to sacrifice rigor,” Collins told the AP earlier this month.

“Definitely the worst thing that could happen is if we rush through a vaccine that turns out to have significant side effects,” Collins added.

Among those who want a vaccine, the AP-NORC poll found protecting themselves, their family and the community are the top reasons.

“I’m definitely going to get it,” said Brandon Grimes, 35, of Austin, Texas. “As a father who takes care of his family, I think ... it’s important for me to get vaccinated as soon as it’s available to better protect my family.”

Poll: 4 in 10 concerned about getting COVID-19 from vaccine shot

And about 7 in 10 of those who would get vaccinated say life won’t go back to normal without a vaccine. A site foreman for his family’s construction business, Grimes travels from house to house interacting with different crews, and said some of his co-workers also are looking forward to vaccination to minimize on-the-job risk.

The new coronavirus is most dangerous to older adults and people of any age who have chronic health problems such as diabetes or heart disease. The poll found 67% of people 60 and older say they’d get vaccinated, compared with 40% who are younger.

And death counts suggest black and Hispanic Americans are more vulnerable to COVID-19, because of unequal access to health care and other factors. Yet the poll found just 25% of African Americans and 37% of Hispanics would get a vaccine compared to 56% of whites.

Among people who don’t want a vaccine, about 4 in 10 say they’re concerned about catching COVID-19 from the shot. But most of the leading vaccine candidates don’t contain the coronavirus itself, meaning they can’t cause infection.

And 3 in 10 who don’t want a vaccine don’t fear getting seriously ill from the coronavirus.

More than 5.5 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and more than 340,000 deaths have been recorded, including nearly 100,000 in the U.S., according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Experts believe the true toll is significantly higher.

And while most people who get COVID-19 have mild cases and recover, doctors still are discovering the coronavirus attacks in far sneakier ways than just causing pneumonia – from blood clots to heart and kidney damage to the latest scare, a life-threatening inflammatory reaction in children.

Whatever the final statistics show about how often it kills, health specialists agree the new coronavirus appears deadlier than the typical flu. Yet the survey suggests a vaccine would be no more popular than the yearly flu shot.

Worldwide, about a dozen COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in early stages of testing or poised to begin. British researchers are opening one of the biggest studies so far, to test an Oxford University-created shot in 10,000 people.

For all the promises of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, only 20% of Americans expect any vaccine to be available to the public by year’s end, the poll found. Most think sometime next year is more likely.

Political divisions seen over how the country reopens the economy are reflected in desire for a vaccine, too. More than half of Democrats call a vaccine necessary for reopening, compared with about a third of Republicans. While 62% of Democrats would get the vaccine, only 43% of Republicans say the same.

“There’s still a large amount of uncertainty around taking the vaccine,” said Caitlin Oppenheimer, who leads NORC’s public health research. “There is a lot of opportunity to communicate with Americans about the value and the safety of a vaccine.”

The AP-NORC poll of 1,056 adults was conducted May 14-18 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.

1042,"San Francisco (CNN) Drugmakers are racing to develop a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus -- a complex feat in itself -- but what might be even trickier is getting it to the public.

The quest to combat a deadly pandemic is exposing bottlenecks in the pharmaceutical supply chain . The world has neither enough glass vials to house the vaccine nor the facility capacity to fill and package them, experts say.

""The demand is going to far outstrip the supply,"" Vijay Kumar, an Evercore analyst who focuses on the medical device and life sciences sectors, told CNN Business in an interview.

The Covid-19 pandemic has consistently shown what happens when supply chains are blindsided by spikes and drop-offs in demand and how an unexpected bottleneck can affect the integrity of the entire system.

The US is coming up short in acquiring ""basic but critical"" supplies to administer a coronavirus vaccine, said Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, in his whistleblower complaint in May.

He said that Strategic National Stockpile has only 2% of the 650 million to 850 million needles and syringes needed and that officials aren't addressing the global shortage of glass vials.

""It could take up to two years to produce enough vials for US vaccine needs, while some therapeutics will also require vials,"" Bright said, according to the complaint.

Using the entire current inventory of vials for a Covid-19 vaccine isn't reasonable because it would create supply woes for ongoing needs such as the annual flu and kids' vaccinations, Evercore's Kumar said.

The pharmaceutical industry started Covid-19 in a tight spot from a packaging perspective, as a medical glass shortage was just starting to even out, he said.

Medical glass isn't made from your typical beach sand, and the vials aren't your everyday soda-lime glass found in many household items.

""Glass shortage stems from sand shortage: There are [fewer than] 1,000 sand mines in the US,"" Kumar and Evercore colleagues wrote in an April 26 research note. ""Desert sand is too smooth to use for glass; most [quartz] sand comes from rivers, and mining it can have ecological and infrastructure consequences.""

Pharmaceutical firms are exploring and devising workarounds that include packing a few doses into larger vials versus single-dose vials. The move saves on bottles, but it drastically raises the chances of the vaccine going to waste, said Prashant Yadav, a healthcare supply chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.

Multiple dose vials could also raise health risks if they're used improperly, notably via reuse of needles, said Jay Walker, said chief executive officer and chairman of ApiJect Systems, which makes pre-filled syringes.

ApiJect, a public benefit corporation, has been one of the companies tapped in recent weeks to help address potential supply chain challenges -- notably the vial shortage as well as the capacity constraints in filling and packaging the vials. The process is complex in nature, costly, and takes time to build because it requires precision and regulatory scrutiny to ensure quality and safety.

, out of an authorized total of in which sterile plastic containers are created, filled and sealed in a matter of seconds. ApiJect's system is expected to produce about 500 of the pre-filled syringes every minute. In March, ApiJect was awarded $10 million by the US Department of Health and Human Servicesout of an authorized total of $456 million, in addition to a more recent award of $138 million from the US Department of Defense to research, develop and produce more than 100 million of the pre-filled syringes by year's end. The syringes are made via a manufacturing processin which sterile plastic containers are created, filled and sealed in a matter of seconds. ApiJect's system is expected to produce about 500 of the pre-filled syringes every minute.

The product serves as an alternative to traditional glass vials for vaccine distribution.

The money will also go toward the retrofitting of existing manufacturing facilities with a goal of producing more than 500 million of the pre-filled syringes in 2021. By 2022, the goal is to have a production capacity of 330 million finished units per month, an HHS spokesperson told CNN Business.

""We're part of the answer, but we're not the whole answer,"" ApiJect's Walker said.

128,"8 June 2020 – To fight the coronavirus and to support the recovery, EU grants €314 million to innovative companies The European Commission has announced that it has awarded 36 companies with nearly €166 million, via the European Innovation Council Accelerator Pilot, will work on pioneering projects: bio-decontamination wipes, developing low-cost mass casualty ventilation monitoring systems, and an antibody platform to treat severe cases of infection. Over €148 million will be granted to another 36 companies set to contribute to the recovery plan for Europe, for example by the development of stronger and taller wind turbine towers made from wood modules.

28 May 2020 - Coronavirus Global Response: “Global Goal: Unite For Our Future” kick-off with support from Global Citizen The Coronavirus Global Response was kick-started on 4 May and has so far raised €9,8 billion for universal access to affordable coronavirus vaccination, treatments and testing. On the launch of the next phase, President von der Leyen said: “The world needs to unit and defeat the virus once and for all. The good news is that this is already happening. We are launch a new campaign “Global Goal: Unite For Our Future” and this idea comes from Global Citizen. During the next month, people will make their voices heard and contribute to our common fight against the coronavirus. On 27 June, I will host a final pledging summit where businesses, foundations and citizens can join forces with public donors.”

27 May 2020 - Europe’s moment: major €2,4 trillion Recovery Plan for Europe unveiled to repair and prepare for the next generation To kick-start the European recovery, protect lives, livelihoods and jobs, the European Commission is proposing a major €2,4 trillion recovery plan which is based on using the full potential of a powerful, modern and revamped EU budget to deliver a more sustainable, digital, inclusive and fair Europe. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “Europe’s next generation will reap the benefits of tomorrow. These investments will not only preserve the outstanding achievements of the last 70 years, but will also ensure that our Union is climate natural, digital, social and a strong global player in the future. This is about all of us. It is way bigger than any of us. This is Europe's moment.”

12 May 2020- €117 million granted for Coronavirus treatments and diagnostics The Commission selected 8 large-scale research projects aimed at developing treatments and diagnostics for the coronavirus, in a fast-track call for proposals launched in March by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private partnership. The Commission increased the Horizon 2020 initially-allocated funding of €45m to €72 million, while €45 million will be provided by the pharmaceutical industry, Innovative Medicines Initiative associated partners and other organisations, bringing the total investment to €117 million. The selected projects are part of the common European response to the coronavirus outbreak that the Commission is coordinating since the beginning of the crisis. By allocating funding from Horizon 2020 and partnering with the pharmaceutical industry, the Commission is able to fund a larger number of high-quality proposals and speed up the development of coronavirus diagnostics and treatments, essential tools necessary to tackle the global emergency.

11 May 2020 – European solidarity in action – rescEU masks delivered to North Macedonia and Montenegro Following previous deliveries to Italy, Spain and Croatia, additional batches of masks are being delivered to North Macedonia and Montenegro via rescEU – the common European reserve of medical equipment to help countries affected by the coronavirus outbreak. A first batch of 1,5 million medical masks was delivered to 17 Member States and the UK to protect healthcare workers against coronavirus on 8 May. Additional weekly instalments of 1,5 million masks will also be delivered over the coming six weeks via the Emergency Support Instrument. Romania and Germany, host the rescEU reserve and are therefore responsible for procuring the equipment, while the Commission finances 100% of purchase of the masks and other equipment. More information here.

29 April 2020 – Tackling the coronavirus crisis: European Commission steps up its support to the Western Balkans The European Commission has announced over €3.3 billion of EU financial support for the Western Balkans – addressing the immediate health and social needs of the coronavirus pandemic, and the economic recovery. In addition to its contribution ahead of the EU-Western Balkans’ leaders meeting of 6 May 2020, the Commission has broadly outlined longer-term support – an Economic and Investment Plan – to be presented in the autumn. President von der Leyen said: “We have a special responsibility to assist in this pandemic our partners in the Western Balkans, as their future clearly lies in European Union. The EU is mobilising a substantial financial package, confirming the strong solidarity. Together we will overcome this crisis and recover”.

24 April 2020 – European Commission to shape a common recovery plan with a revamped EU long-term budget at its heart European leaders tasked the European Commission with shaping a collective response to the crisis following a videoconference on 23 April. A thorough economic assessment will soon be under way and the European budget, clearly linked to the Recovery Fund, is a time-tested and a trusted instrument that can deliver the magnitude of tasks behind the recovery. The bulk of the investments will go to creating investments and economic cohesion, improving the Union’s resilience and autonomy, all while furthering modern policies like the European Green Deal and the digital transition. Solid partnerships in the EU’s immediate neighbourhood must also be strengthened. “ The next EU long-term budget, our next seven-year budget, has to adapt to the new circumstances, post-corona crisis. We need to increase its firepower to be able to generate the necessary investment across the whole European Union,” said President von der Leyen. This whole endeavour is about protecting the Single Market, investments should be front-loaded in the first years and it will be necessary to find the right balance between grants and loans.

To swiftly support agricultural sector and food markets following the outbreak of the coronavirus, the European Commission has proposed exceptional measures. The Commission proposes to grant private storage aid for dairy and meat products, flexibility in the implementation of market support programmes to refocus funding priorities, and exceptional derogation from EU competition rules to stabilise the markets in different sectors. For example, the milk sector will be allowed to collectively plan milk production and the flower and potatoes sector will be allowed to withdraw products from the market. Such agreements and decisions would only be valid for a period of maximum six months. Consumer price movements will be monitored closely to avoid adverse effects. The Commission aims to have these measures adopted by the end of April.

16 April – 2020 – President von der Leyen: “The European budget will be the mothership of Europe’s recovery” Despite Europe’s collective response being well above €3 trillion – the most impressive response in the world - more is needed, President von der Leyen said at the European Parliament. The EU budget will be the mothership of Europe’s recovery, driving the economy towards a more green and digital Europe. Investments in large-scale renovation, renewables, clean transport, sustainable food and nature restoration will be more important than before. Using every single euro available has meant investing in the procurement of medical equipment, the development of vaccines, securing jobs and supporting business to jumpstart the economy. President von der Leyen concluded with a passionate plea for the European Union: “If we all stand up for Europe today – with courage, trust and solidarity – I know that tomorrow Europe’s soul will shine brighter than ever before.”

14 April 2020 – €2,7 billion from the EU budget to support the healthcare sector To directly support healthcare systems in EU countries, the European Commission proposed to activate the EU’s Emergency Support Instrument – a measure that that Council quickly approved on 14 April. The €2.7 billion Instrument will support the distribution of protective gear, the movement of patients to hospitals with free capacity, and to the development of medication and testing methods. The instrument will be used together with other EU tools, for example the rescEU medical stockpile, which is receiving €300 million in addition to the initially proposed allocation of €80 million, to support the distribution of medical equipment across the EU. It will also be possible for individuals, foundations and Member States to make donations and crowd fund.

The Commission proposed to postpone regulations on medical devices by one year to allow manufacturers to focus on the production of critical medical devices and avoiding shortages or delays potentially caused by regulatory bodies, thereby and saving lives. The Commission also decided to temporarily lift customs duties and VAT on the import of medical devices and protective equipment from third countries. By making the import of masks, gloves, overalls and other protective equipment in some cases by up to one third cheaper, the decision will further increase the availability of these critical goods and help those in need. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said: “We are working on all fronts to remove the obstacles standing in our way to ensure that our health professionals get what they need to save lives.”

02 April - Coronavirus response: Commission mobilises every euro to protect lives and livelihoods To quickly support workers and mitigate the unemployment risks that come with the Coronavirus outbreak, the Commission launched a new initiative called SURE - Support mitigating Unemployment Risks in Emergency. To help preserve jobs and support families, SURE will provide financial assistance of up to €100 billion to Member States, in the form of loans granted on favourable terms. It also proposed to redirect all available structural funds to the response to the coronavirus. Farmers and fishermen will also receive support, as will the most deprived of aid. An EU Solidarity for Health Initiative worth €3billion will cater for the needs of Member States’ health systems. The profound impact of the Coronavirus crisis requires a response unprecedented in scale, speed and solidarity. With today’s package, the Commission delivers just that.",mainstream,M0aab6,coronavirus; vaccine.covid
221,"China has a fifth potential coronavirus vaccine in a human trial and more are on the way, a health official said Friday, as the world races to find a formula to stop the contagion in its tracks.

So far there have been no ""major adverse reactions"" reported among the 2,575 volunteers participating in the five phase-two tests, said Zeng Yixin, deputy director of the National Health Commission.

""According to the plan, if all goes well, the above projects will complete the second phase of clinical trials in July this year,"" Zeng said.

More vaccine candidates are in the pipeline and awaiting approval for human trials, he added.

China had previously said four human trials for possible vaccines were under way.

Zeng did not say when the trials, which must complete three phases for the drug to be approved for use, might be finished.

Scientists around the world are working at breakneck speed to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, which has killed more than 300,000 people and infected over 4.4 million.

But China's success in largely taming the outbreak could pose a hurdle for its vaccine developers when they reach the final stage of testing.

The drug must be administered to a group of volunteers and a placebo given to a control group in the same area where the virus is spreading to see if it works.

Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech, which developed one of the vaccines being tested, has told AFP that it is looking to carry out the final stage of its trial abroad because China does not have a large enough coronavirus cluster.

Experts say it will take at least 12 to 18 months to develop an effective vaccine, possibly even longer.",mainstream,M0b288,vaccine; vaccine.covid
553,"This article was updated on June 4, 2020 Coronaviruses typically affect the respiratory tracts of birds and mammals, including humans. Doctors associate them with the common cold, bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These viruses can also affect the gut. Coronaviruses usually cause the common cold, though they can be responsible for more severe illnesses. Over the past 80 years, scientists have found that these viruses can infect mice, rats, dogs, cats, turkeys, horses, pigs, and cattle. Sometimes, these animals transmit the viruses to humans. Most recently, authorities identified a new coronavirus outbreak in China that has now reached other countries. The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it can cause COVID-19. In this article, we explain the different types of human coronavirus, their symptoms, and how people transmit them. We also focus on three particularly dangerous diseases caused by coronaviruses: COVID-19, SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment.

Covering the mouth when sneezing can help stop the spread of coronaviruses. Researchers first identified a coronavirus in 1937, isolating one that was responsible for a type of bronchitis in birds that had the potential to devastate poultry stocks. Scientists found evidence of human coronaviruses in the 1960s, in the noses of people with the common cold. 



Human coronaviruses that are particularly prevalent include 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. The name “coronavirus” comes from the crown-like projections on their surfaces. “Corona” in Latin means “halo” or “crown.” Among humans, coronavirus infections most often occur during the winter months and early spring.

In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started monitoring the outbreak of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Authorities first identified the virus in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has spread to nearly every country, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic. The new coronavirus has been responsible for millions of infections globally, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The United States has seen the highest number of these deaths. The first people with COVID-19 had links to an animal and seafood market. This suggests that animals initially transmitted the virus to humans. Then, people with no connections to the market developed the disease, confirming that humans can pass the virus to each other. Most people who get COVID-19 will have a mild form of the disease. According to the WHO, around 80% of people who get COVID-19 will recover without needing hospitalization. The remaining 20% become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing. Some groups are more at risk of severe disease, including older adults and people with underlying medical concerns, including high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, and cancer. The mortality rate varies between countries. In the U.S., the death rate is around 6%. According to the CDC, children are not at higher risk of COVID-19 than adults. Pregnant women appear to have the same risk of COVID-19 as other adults. However, during pregnancy, women have a higher risk of severe illness from viruses that are similar to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. The CDC also recommend that infants born to women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are put into isolation. According to the CDC, people may start to experience symptoms 2–14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include:
• new loss of taste or smell No vaccine is currently available for COVID-19. However, scientists have now replicated the virus. This could allow for early detection and treatment in people who have the virus but are not experiencing symptoms. According to the CDC, the following groups have a higher risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19:
• people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions, including chronic lung disease, serious heart conditions, severe obesity, a compromised immune system, or diabetes The CDC note that although there have been reports of complications in young children, these are rare. COVID-19 most commonly produces mild symptoms in children.

Cold- or flu-like symptoms usually set in around 2–4 days after the infection develops. Typically, the symptoms are mild, though they vary from person to person. In some people, coronavirus infections are fatal. While scientists can easily cultivate rhinoviruses — which also cause the common cold — in the laboratory, this is not the case with coronaviruses. This makes it difficult to gauge the impact of these pathogens. There is currently no cure for the cold-like illnesses caused by coronaviruses. Treatments include self-care and over-the-counter medications. Taking the following steps may help: A doctor can identify the virus responsible in a sample of fluid from a person’s body, such as a sample of blood or mucus from the nose.

Coronaviruses belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae. Different types of coronavirus vary, in terms of the severity of disease that they cause and how far they spread. Doctors currently recognize seven types of coronavirus that can infect humans. Rarer strains that cause more severe illnesses include MERS-CoV, which causes the disease MERS, and SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for SARS. In 2019, a new strain, called SARS-CoV-2, started circulating, causing the disease COVID-19.

The CDC recommend that all people wear cloth face masks in public places where it is difficult to maintain a 6-foot (2-meter) distance from others. This will help slow the spread of the virus from asymptomatic people and people who do not know that they have contracted it. People should wear cloth face masks while continuing to practice physical distancing. Instructions for making masks at home are available here. Note: It is critical that surgical masks and N95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers. Researchers believe that the viruses transmit via fluids in the respiratory system, such as mucus. For example, a coronavirus can spread when a person:
• coughs or sneezes without covering their mouth, dispersing droplets into the air
• touches someone who has the infection
• touches a surface that has the virus, then touches their own nose, eyes, or mouth Some animal coronaviruses may spread to humans through contact with feces, though it is unclear whether human coronaviruses can spread in the same way. Coronaviruses will infect most people at some point. To prevent transmission, people with symptoms should stay at home, rest, and avoid coming into close contact with other people. Covering the mouth and nose with a tissue or handkerchief while coughing or sneezing can also help prevent transmission. It is important to dispose of used tissues right away and maintain proper hygiene around the home.

MERS is caused by the MERS-CoV coronavirus. Scientists first recognized this severe respiratory illness in 2012 after it surfaced in Saudi Arabia. Since then, it has spread to other countries. The virus has reached the U.S. However, only two people in the country have tested positive for MERS-CoV, and this was in 2014. As a result, the CDC state that the risk of developing MERS in the U.S. is very low. Symptoms of MERS include a fever, breathlessness, and coughing. 



The illness spreads through close contact with people who have the infection. A 2019 investigation into MERS found that the disease is fatal in 35.2% of people who develop it. Keep up to date on the current COVID-19 outbreak. The CDC have also a resource on reducing the risk of infection.",mainstream,M086e6,covid.19; vaccine.covid

548,"WHITE HOUSE - U.S. President Donald Trump is saying he is confident there will be a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the year, and mass inoculations of the public will occur quickly. 

 

 “I think distribution will take place almost simultaneously because we've geared up the military,” Trump explained on Thursday, adding that further details will be released on Friday.

 

 The president’s prediction contrasts with testimony heard on Capitol Hill shortly before Trump spoke on the White House South Lawn. 

 

 The ousted director of the federal government’s vaccine agency told lawmakers, “We don’t have a plan” to mass-produce and distribute a coronavirus vaccine. Hope for such a vaccine within 12 to 18 months assumes ""everything goes perfectly,” Dr. Rick Bright testified. ""We've never seen everything go perfectly.” 

 

 More than 90 vaccines for the novel coronavirus are in development around the world. German company CureVac said Thursday that one of its mRNA candidate vaccines has protected animals from the virus at low doses. Clinical trials are expected to begin next month. 

 

 Bright was removed as the director of the Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which is under the Department of Health and Human Services, an action that prompted the immunologist to file a whistleblower complaint. 

 

 Trump told reporters he watched some of Thursday’s testimony by Bright and “he looks like an angry, disgruntled employee who, frankly, according to some people, didn't do a very good job.”

Bright told a House health subcommittee that higher officials, including those at the White House, ignored his early warning about COVID-19, and the federal government was ill-prepared to respond to a pandemic.

 

 The current administration blames any shortcomings on plans and supplies left by the previous administration of Barack Obama, who turned the presidency over to Trump in January 2017. 

 

 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said this would be explained “line by line” in a briefing for reporters on Friday. 

 

 The president, prior to visiting a medical supply distributor in Pennsylvania, returned to his previous controversial promotion of an unproven malaria drug for treatment of the novel coronavirus. 

 

 “We’ve had tremendous response to the hydroxy(chloroquine),” asserted Trump, who also criticized Bright for “fighting it” when he was running BARDA. 

 

 Bright and others cautioned about the need for scientific studies about using the drug for COVID-19 treatment and warned of its dangers, including the possibility it could kill people. 

 

 Asked by a reporter if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is over-counting U.S. deaths from the coronavirus, Trump replied, “I don't know how they're counting. I never discussed it with them. Death is death. We don't want people dying in this country. And we've done a great job.” 

 

 The United States has recorded the most deaths and most COVID-19 cases of any country. 

 

 As of Thursday afternoon EDT, according to records compiled by Johns Hopkins University, 1.4 million people had tested positive for the virus and more than 85,000 had died in the country.

At a Thursday afternoon event, partly resembling a campaign rally, at a medical supply distribution company in the election battleground state of Pennsylvania, the president promoted the replenishment of the strategic national stockpile.

Trump linked the high rate of COVID-19 cases in the United States to the country's having conducted the most tests.

“When you test, you have a case,” the president said. “If we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few cases.”",mainstream,M07940,vaccine; vaccine.covid
78,"Measles, or rubeola, is a viral infection that starts in the respiratory system. It still remains a significant cause of death worldwide, despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine. There were about 110,000 global deaths related to measles in 2017, most of them in children under the age of 5, according to the . Measles cases have also been increasing in the United States in recent years. Learn more about the symptoms of measles, how it spreads, and how it can be prevented.

Measles is caused by infection with a virus from the paramyxovirus family. Viruses are tiny parasitic microbes. Once you’ve been infected, the virus invades host cells and uses cellular components to complete its life cycle. The measles virus infects the respiratory tract first. However, it eventually spreads to other parts of the body through the bloodstream. Measles is only known to occur in humans and not in other animals. There are known genetic types of measles, although only 6 are currently circulating.

Measles can be spread through the air from respiratory droplets and small aerosol particles. An infected person can release the virus into the air when they cough or sneeze. These respiratory particles can also settle on objects and surfaces. You can become infected if you come into contact with a contaminated object, such as a door handle, and then touch your face, nose, or mouth. The measles virus can live outside of the body for longer than you may think. In fact, it can remain infectious in the air or on surfaces for up to .

Measles is highly contagious. This means that the infection can spread very easily from person to person. A susceptible person that’s exposed to the measles virus has a 90 percent chance of becoming infected. Additionally, an infected person can go on to spread the virus to anywhere between 9 and 18 susceptible individuals. A person that has measles can spread the virus to others before they even know that they have it. An infected person is contagious for four days before the characteristic rash appears. After the rash appears, they’re still contagious for another four days. The main risk factor for catching measles is being unvaccinated. Additionally, some groups are at a higher risk of developing complications from measles infection, including young children, people with a weakened immune system, and pregnant women.

If you suspect that you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, contact your doctor immediately. They can evaluate you and direct you where to be seen to determine if you have the infection. Doctors can confirm measles by examining your skin rash and checking for symptoms that are characteristic of the disease, such as white spots in the mouth, fever, cough, and sore throat. If they suspect you may have measles based on your history and observation, your doctor will order a blood test to check for the measles virus.

There’s no specific treatment for measles. Unlike bacterial infections, viral infections aren’t sensitive to antibiotics. The virus and symptoms typically disappear in about two or three weeks. There are some interventions available for people who may have been exposed to the virus. These can help prevent an infection or lessen its severity. They include:
• a measles vaccine, given within 72 hours of exposure
• a dose of immune proteins called immunoglobulin, taken within six days of exposure Your doctor may recommend the following to help you recover:
• rest to help boost your immune system

Although it’s often associated with childhood illness, adults can get measles too. People who aren’t vaccinated are at a higher risk of catching the disease. It’s generally accepted that adults born during or before 1957 are naturally immune to measles. This is because the vaccine was first licensed in 1963. Before then, most people had been naturally exposed to the infection by their adolescent years and became immune as a result. According to the , serious complications are not only more common in young children, but also in adults over the age of 20. These complications can include things like pneumonia, encephalitis, and blindness. If you’re an adult who hasn’t been vaccinated or isn’t sure of their vaccination status, you should see your doctor to receive the vaccination. At least one dose of the vaccine is recommended for unvaccinated adults.

The measles vaccine isn’t given to children until they’re at least 12 months old. Before receiving their first dose of the vaccine is the time they’re most vulnerable to being infected with the measles virus. Babies receive some protection from measles through passive immunity, which is provided from mother to child through the placenta and during breastfeeding. However, has shown that this immunity can be lost in just over 2.5 months after birth or the time breastfeeding is discontinued. Children under 5 years of age are more likely to have complications due to measles. These can include things like pneumonia, encephalitis, and ear infections that can result in hearing loss.

The incubation period of an infectious disease is the time that passes between exposure and when symptoms develop. The incubation period for measles is between 10 and 14 days. After the initial incubation period, you may begin to experience nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, cough, and runny nose. The rash will begin to develop several days later. It’s important to remember that you can still spread the infection to others for four days prior to developing the rash. If you think you’ve been exposed to measles and haven’t been vaccinated, you should contact your doctor as soon as possible.

In addition to a classic measles infection, there are also several other types of measles infections that you can get. Atypical measles occurs in people who received a killed measles vaccine between 1963 and 1967. When exposed to measles, these individuals come down with an illness that has symptoms such as high fever, rash, and sometimes pneumonia. Modified measles occurs in people who’ve been given post-exposure immunoglobulin and in infants who still have some passive immunity. Modified measles is typically milder than a regular case of measles. Hemorrhagic measles is rarely reported in the United States. It causes symptoms like high fever, seizures, and bleeding into the skin and mucus membranes.

You may have heard rubella referred to as “German measles.” But measles and rubella are actually caused by two different viruses. Rubella isn’t as contagious as measles. However, it can cause serious complications if a woman develops the infection while pregnant. Even though different viruses cause measles and rubella, they’re also similar in several ways. Both viruses:
• can be spread through the air from coughing and sneezing Both measles and rubella are included in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines.

There a few ways to prevent becoming ill with measles. Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent measles. Two doses of the measles vaccine are effective at preventing measles infection. There are two vaccines available — the MMR vaccine and the MMRV vaccine. The MMR vaccine is a three-in-one vaccination that can protect you from measles, mumps, and rubella. The MMRV vaccine protects against the same infections as the MMR vaccine and also includes protection against chickenpox. Children can receive their first vaccination at 12 months, or sooner if traveling internationally, and their second dose between the ages of 4 and 6. Adults who have never received an immunization can request the vaccine from their doctor. Some groups shouldn’t receive a vaccination against measles. These groups include:
• people who’ve had a previous life-threatening reaction to the measles vaccine or its components
• immunocompromised individuals, which can include people with HIV or AIDS, people undergoing cancer treatment, or people on medications that suppress the immune system Side effects to vaccination are typically mild and disappear in a few days. They can include things like fever and mild rash. In rare cases, the vaccine has been linked to low platelet count or seizures. Most children and adults who receive a measles vaccine don’t experience side effects. Some believe that the measles vaccine can cause autism in children. As a result, an intense amount of study has been devoted to this topic over many years. This research has found that there is between vaccines and autism. Vaccination isn’t just important for protecting you and your family. It’s also important for protecting people who can’t be vaccinated. When more people are vaccinated against a disease, it’s less likely to circulate within the population. This is called herd immunity. To achieve herd immunity against measles, approximately of the population must be vaccinated. Not everyone can receive the measles vaccination. But there are other ways that you can help to prevent the spread of measles.
• Practice good hand hygiene. Wash your hands before eating, after using the bathroom, and before touching your face, mouth, or nose.
• Don’t share personal items with people who may be ill. This can include things like eating utensils, drinking glasses, and toothbrushes.
• Avoid coming into contact with people who are sick
• Stay home from work or school and other public places until you aren’t contagious. This is four days after you first develop the measles rash.
• Avoid contact with people who may be vulnerable to infection, such as infants too young to be vaccinated and immunocompromised people.
• Cover your nose and mouth if you need to cough or sneeze. Dispose of all used tissues promptly. If you don’t have a tissue available, sneeze into the crook of your elbow, not into your hand.
• Be sure to wash your hands frequently and to disinfect any surfaces or objects that you touch frequently.

Pregnant women who don’t have immunity to measles should take care to avoid exposure during their pregnancy. Coming down with measles during your pregnancy can have significant negative health effects on both the mother and fetus. Pregnant women are at an increased risk for complications from measles such as pneumonia. Additionally, having measles while pregnant can lead to the following pregnancy complications: Measles can also be transmitted from mother to child if the mother has measles close to her delivery date. This is called congenital measles. Babies with congenital measles have a rash after birth or develop one shortly afterward. They’re at an increased risk of complications, which can be life-threatening. If you’re pregnant, don’t have immunity to measles, and believe that you’ve been exposed, you should contact your doctor immediately. Receiving an injection of immunoglobulin may help to prevent an infection.

Measles has a low death rate in healthy children and adults, and most people who contract the measles virus recover fully. The risk of complications is higher in the following groups: Approximately of people with measles experience one or more complications. Measles can lead to life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Other complications associated with measles may include:
• pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage or preterm labor
• subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare degenerative condition of the nervous system that develops years after infection You can’t get measles more than once. After you’ve had the virus, you’re immune for life. However, measles and its potential complications are preventable through vaccination. Vaccination not only protects you and your family, but also prevents the measles virus from circulating in your community and affecting those who can’t be vaccinated.",mainstream,M09ea3,vaccine.autism
1186,"SAVAGE: ‘I Will Refuse to Take’ Rushed COVID Vaccine, It Will Be ‘Ineffective and Dangerous’

Talk radio titan Michael Savage took a strong stance on the topic of a potential COVID-19 vaccine this week, stating that he would refuse to take such a vaccine if it was rushed into production.

Late Sunday night, Savage tweeted, “Covid vaccine! I will refuse to take it! It will be ineffective and dangerous. There are now 20 known mutations.”

Savage added, “I have never taken a flu shot, and I will refuse to take a COVID VACCINE. If the Govt makes it ‘mandatory’ what will you do?”

The talk radio host expounded on his reasoning in Monday’s edition of The Savage Nation podcast.

“I tweeted something that got me mad, because they’re all talking about a COVID vaccine, and I know, having studied these things, having studied the flu vaccines which are about thirty to forty, maybe forty percent effective… if you look at flu vaccines, not only are they ineffective – thirty-seven percent to fifty percent is what we’re seeing in reports – there are huge side effects to flu vaccines,” Savage said.

“So now they’re telling us they’re gonna rush a COVID vaccine when we know there have been twenty to thirty mutations of this virus already, and I’m very, very concerned that they’re rushing out a vaccine that will be dangerous, ineffective, et cetera, so I said this,” Savage said before reading the tweet aloud.

Savage continued, “And if these fascistic, quote, liberal governors think they have a problem on their hands that they’re making believe will go away with the shutdowns, wait until they try to tell you that you must have a vaccine to leave your house. I would join a militia before I took a vaccine. I’d go to the hills, I’m not taking it, I refuse. And I don’t care who tells me I have to take it, if Donald Trump tells me to take it, I’m not taking it, you hear me? I’m not taking it for Jesus, I’m not taking it for Trump, I’m not taking it for Moses, I’m not not taking it for Isaiah, I’m not taking it for Muhammad, I’m not taking it for Charlie Parker, I’m not taking it.”

Savage’s full podcast from Monday can be heard on the May 4 episode of his podcast at around the 37 minute mark.

1043,"There are 4 groups of people who are advised to get vaccinated against pneumococcal infections:
• anyone from the ages of 2 to 64 with a health condition that increases their risk of pneumococcal infection
• anyone at occupational risk, such as welders

Babies are routinely vaccinated with a type of pneumococcal vaccine known as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) as part of their childhood vaccination programme.

Babies born on or after 1 January 2020 have 2 injections, which are usually given at:

Babies born before this date will continue to be offered 3 doses, at 8 and 16 weeks and a booster at 1 year.

Adults aged 65 or over and the pneumococcal vaccine

If you're 65 or over, you should be offered a type of pneumococcal vaccine known as the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV).

This one-off vaccination is very effective at protecting you against serious forms of pneumococcal infection.

People with health problems and the pneumococcal vaccine

The PPV vaccine is available on the NHS for children and adults aged from 2 to 64 years old who are at a higher risk of developing a pneumococcal infection than the general population.

This is generally the same people who are eligible for annual flu vaccination.

You're considered to be at a higher risk of a pneumococcal infection if you have:
• had your spleen removed, your spleen does not work properly, or you're at risk of your spleen not working properly in future (for example, if you have coeliac disease)
• a suppressed immune system caused by a health condition, such as HIV
• a suppressed immune system caused by medicines, such as chemotherapy or steroid tablets
• a cochlear implant (a hearing device) – Action on Hearing Loss has more information about cochlear implants
• had a leak of cerebrospinal fluid (the clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spine) – this could be the result of an accident or surgery

Adults and children who are severely immunocompromised (including anyone with leukaemia, multiple myeloma, genetic disorders affecting the immune system, or after a bone marrow transplant) usually have a single dose of PCV followed by PPV.

Welders and metal workers and the pneumococcal vaccine

Some people with an occupational risk are advised to have the pneumococcal vaccine, including those who work with metal fumes, such as welders.

If you're at increased risk of a pneumococcal infection, you'll be given a single dose of the PPV vaccine.

But if your spleen does not work properly or you have a chronic kidney condition, you may need booster doses of PPV every 5 years.

This is because your levels of antibodies against the infection decrease over time.

Your GP surgery will advise you on whether you'll need a booster dose.

What to do if you miss a dose of pneumococcal vaccine

If you or your child has missed a routine dose of pneumococcal vaccine, speak to your GP surgery about when you can complete the course.",mainstream,M08129,vaccine; vaccine.covid
1220,"The idea that vaccines cause autism received yet another blow this week, with a new article in the British Journal of Medicine declaring the 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, which originally found an autism-vaccine link, an ""elaborate fraud."" The article is the latest criticism of a theory that has been widely discredited. But if vaccines are off the table, what does cause autism?

While scientists are still investigating the issue, they say the disorder likely has a number of causes involving both our genes and our environment, or some combination of the two. For instance, people may have underlying genetic susceptibilities to autism that are triggered by something they encounter in the environment.

Making things even more complicated is the fact that autism, which is characterized by problems interacting and communicating with others, is not a single disorder, but a range of disorders that may have various causes. [See a timeline of events: Vaccines and Autism: How the Truth Unfolded]

""People are going to manifest the disorder in different ways, and that could be because there are different sets of genes, [or] different sets of environmental factors,"" that contribute to how the disorder presents itself, said Alycia Halladay, director of research for environmental sciences for Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy organization that funds autism research.

Here are the latest findings and ideas from scientists about what might really cause this mysterious condition.

There is strong evidence that changes in our genes contribute to autism.

For one thing, the disorder is highly heritable. Families that have one child with autism have a 1 in 20 chance of having a second child with autism, according to the National Institutes of Health. This is a higher risk than in the general population. And twin studies have found that if one twin has autism, the other twin as a 90 percent chance of having the disorder.

Research has also shown that the genetic changes that contribute to autism don't have to be inherited — they may also arise spontaneously.

In total, scientists have identified about 20 genes that may be involved in autism spectrum disorder, Halladay said. While these genes are located all over the human genome, they share a common theme, she said. Many have a role in brain development, brain growth and the way brain cells communicate.

For example, a recent study found that children with a genetic mutation on chromosome 17 were 14 times more likely to develop autism than those without the mutation.

Exposure to pesticides has also been linked to autism. Some studies have found that pesticides may interfere with genes involved in the central nervous system, said Dr. Alice Mao, a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

Scientists think that chemicals in pesticides may adversely affect those who are genetically predisposed to autism, leading them to develop the full-blown disorder, Mao said.

""Maybe they were born with a vulnerability to autism, but then exposure to the pesticides might have cause the presentation of autism,"" Mao told MyHealthNewsDaily.

Babies that have been exposed to certain pharmaceuticals in the womb, including valproic acid and thalidomide, have been found to have a higher risk of autism.

Thalidomide is a drug that was first used in the 1950s to treat morning sickness, anxiety and insomnia. The drug was withdrawn from the market after it was linked with birth defects, but is currently prescribed for a severe skin disorder and as a treatment for cancer.

Valproic acid is a medication prescribed for seizures, mood disorders and bipolar disorder, according to the NIH.

As parents grow older, they have a higher risk of having children with autism, Halladay said.

A study published last February found that women who are 40 years old have a 50 percent greater risk of having a child with autism than women who are between 20 and 29 years old.

Researchers aren't sure why parental age may influence autism risk, but it might be related to genetic mutations that occur in the sperm or the egg as parents grow older, Halladay said.

The development of the brain

Particular areas of the brain, including the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, have been implicated in autism, Mao said. These brain areas are thought to be responsible for concentration, movement and mood regulation.

Irregularities in the levels of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, have also been tied to autism, Mao said. Problems regulating dopamine can lead to problems with concentration and movement disabilities, while troubles controlling serotonin levels can result in mood problems.

While scientists cannot say definitively what causes autism, they have come a long way in the last decade, Halladay said.

For example, researchers originally thought there might be just a single gene or a few environmental factors that are linked to autism, but now evidence has shown there are likely to be more.

""I think our knowledge has increased, and the way that we go about looking for potential genes and environmental candidates has improved,"" Halladay said.

""We're thinking about a new model — it's not just going to be just one gene or one environmental factor, it's more complex than that,"" she said.

Pass it on: Autism likely has a number of causes, both genetic and environmental.

429,"Global coronavirus vaccine makers have been rolling out details about their manufacturing and launch plans—even ahead of any clinical data. Now, Pfizer says it will draw on three sites in the U.S., plus one in Belgium, for the early stages of a launch, provided its BioNTech-partnered shot wins a green light.

Pfizer plans to draw on sites in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and Andover, Massachusetts, as well as St. Louis for the early stages of its mRNA vaccine ramp-up. The company is in human testing with four candidates alongside partner BioNTech, which will supply doses for clinical testing.

The company plans raw material manufacturing in St. Louis and drug substance manufacturing in Andover. The Kalamazoo site is slated to handle formulation and filling.

Aside from Pfizer's U.S. sites, the drugmaker has identified a plant in Puurs, Belgium, as a COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing center. The company plans to select other sites as well. For its part, BioNTech intends to add capacity at two of its facilities in Germany.

Pfizer believes it can deliver millions of doses by the end of 2020—which would be a remarkable accomplishment—and then deliver hundreds of millions in 2021.

Even though the partners just entered human testing and haven't reported any data, Pfizer employees are taking steps to prepare for the possible rollout now.

Those include exchanging technology to plan the manufacturing process, ordering materials, preparing “parallel” supply chains and hiring new staff. Like other companies, Pfizer is doing the work “at risk,” or before the vaccine demonstrates efficacy, to cut crucial time it would take to launch if the data turn out positive.

RELATED: Pfizer, BioNTech dose first U.S. subject with COVID-19 vaccine

In response to the news, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that she's ""so proud that one of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the world is the Pfizer site right here in Kalamazoo,"" citing how global supply chains have hindered the U.S. COVID-19 response.

Pfizer isn’t alone in planning for a massive COVID-19 vaccine ramp-up. Part of the reason Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline entered their unprecedented tie-up was to combine scale for a massive rollout in 2021. Those companies, plus Pfizer and Merck & Co., are the largest vaccine players in the world.

Johnson & Johnson, meanwhile, has struck multiple manufacturing deals for its own COVID-19 vaccine program with plans to produce more than 1 billion doses. The New Jersey drugmaker’s deal with Emergent BioSolutions was intended to ensure U.S. production for early batches, The New York Times reported. J&J has also signed a deal with Catalent.

Meanwhile, AstraZeneca has signed on to produce and distribute vaccines for the University of Oxford's promising program, which is speeding ahead.

And Moderna, which has one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine projects, has signed a manufacturing deal with Lonza for up to a billion doses per year. Moderna on Thursday said it has received FDA approval to enter phase 2 testing and is planning phase 3 testing in the ""early summer.""",mainstream,M09778,vaccine
1066,"The toddler months continue to bring the medical challenges of colds, scrapes and bruises, and other minor emergencies. You'll also find yourself dealing with an emerging personality and increasing conflicts.

Your doctor will see your child four times for routine well visits during this period, at 12, 15, 18, and 24 months. If your toddler has missed any immunizations, or if a problem has been detected that needs special attention, additional visits may be scheduled.

What to Expect During the Office Visit

The well-child checkups during your child's second year are similar to those before, but discussions with your doctor about behavior and habits may become more detailed as your toddler gets older.
• Measurement of your child's length, weight, and head circumference. Growth will be plotted on the growth chart, and you'll be advised of your toddler's progress.
• A review of your toddler's development through both observation and your progress report. Is your tot starting to walk? Scribbling? Following simple instructions? Saying a few words? Combining two words by age 2? The doctor may ask you these questions and others like them.
• The doctor may go over safety questions such as: Have you childproofed your home? (You'll need to review your babyproofing efforts now that your toddler can stand and reach.) Is your tot in an appropriate safety seat while riding in the car?
• A discussion of your child's eating habits. Is he or she eating a variety of foods? Finger feeding or using a spoon? Using a cup? Being weaned from the breast or bottle? Most doctors advise a switch from bottle to cup between 12 and 18 months.
• Advice on what to expect in the coming months.

If they haven't already, kids this age might undergo a tuberculin skin test, especially those at risk for tuberculosis. You'll be given instructions on how to monitor the test and report results to the doctor's office. Your doctor may recommend a blood test to check for anemia and lead poisoning.

Address any questions or concerns you have, and write down any specific instructions the doctor gives you regarding special care. Keep updating your child's permanent medical record, listing information on growth and any problems or illnesses.

A child who did not have them at the 12-month visit will get these vaccines at 15 months:
• the third or fourth Hib vaccine, depending on the manufacturer

At the 18-month visit, if not already been given, children should get:
• third hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), which can be given starting at 6 months
• third inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which can be given starting at 6 months

Your child may also get a flu shot, which is recommended every year before flu season for children older than 6 months. If your child is at high risk for developing meningococcal disease, a serious infection that can lead to bacterial meningitis, your doctor may offer the meningococcal vaccine as well.

Discuss possible vaccine reactions with your doctor and get advice on when to call with problems.

At the 18-month visit, toddlers undergo a screening test to help identify developmental delays and autism.

There is a wide range of normal when it comes to reaching developmental milestones. But by 18 months, most toddlers:
• walk on their own

By age 2, toddlers should be able to:
• put two words together to form a sentence

Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about your child's development.

When Should I Call the Doctor?

By now you have probably called your doctor's office many times with questions and concerns about your child's health. Don't hesitate to notify the doctor if you think that something is wrong — you know your child best.

And always call the doctor if your child has a fever, is acting sick, has serious problems sleeping, is refusing all food or drink, is vomiting, or has diarrhea.",mainstream,M0b28a,vaccine.autism

Hillary Clinton “Total Terror” Descends Upon Disabled Mother Who Discovered Her Link To

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

A heartbreaking Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today details the “total terror” Hillary Clinton and her Obama regime allies have unleashed upon a disabled American mother of an autistic son who had “inadvertently/mistakenly” discovered an “electronic document” (email? photocopy?) written by the former Secretary of State authorizing a massive weapons shipment from , , to Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/Daesh) terrorists in . [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, earlier this spring the General Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) reported that they obtained a “treasure trove” of secret Islamic State documents from a Syrian village that had been retaking by Kurdish forces.

Among these documents (now classified at the highest security level) obtained by the GRU, this report continues, were detailed arrangements between the Islamic State terrorists and the US Department of State on the transferring of weapons and other war materials to Syria from Libya in exchange for payment at the Turkish-Syrian border of oil stolen from by these terrorists from both Syria and Iraq.

Upon the SVR’s examination of these Islamic State documents, as was requested by the GRU, this report continues, it was discovered that these terrorists had “electronically sent” (Twitter) a number of them to their global supporters via online social media as proof that they were being supported by the United States.

With Wikileaks having confirmed the validity of these documents proving Hillary Clinton armed these Islamic State terrorists, and US Senator Rand Paul, likewise, publically stating that she had shipped weapons to ISIS terror forces in Syria from Benghazi, and then lied about it, this report notes, none of America’s mainstream propaganda press organs have yet to tell the American people of these horrific facts.

With the “vacuum of truth” relating to Hillary Clinton’s grave crimes being created by America’s mainstream press, this report continues, it has been left to that nations independent journalists to keep the true facts flowing—and whom the Obama regime, and its propaganda press supporters, now label as “conspiracy theorists”.

So terrified, in fact, has Hillary Clinton and the Obama regime become of these independent journalists they now call “conspiracy theorists”, this report documents, top Obama official Cass Sunstein co-authored, in 2008, a report titled Conspiracy Theories: Causes and Cures telling both Obama and Hillary Clinton how to move against them—and that the secret US intelligence documents released by Edward Snowden proved was being implemented by covert American agents who had infiltrated the internet to manipulate, deceive and destroy the reputations of all dissidents considered as enemies.

To those independent journalists who couldn’t be stopped by having Obama and Hillary Clinton destroy their reputations, this report continues, they turned to methods of “total terror”—such as is currently being used against a disabled 38-year-old mother of two named Safya Roe Yassin, one of whose children is autistic.

Ms Yassin, this report explains is an American citizen born in the United States, who has never left her country, considers herself as an independent journalist, has never met a Muslim person, but was charged by the Obama regime with the grave crime of supporting ISIS—she isn’t accused of plotting a domestic attack or trying to travel overseas to join the terrorist group. she simply reported the news.

What made Ms Yassin terrifying to Hillary Clinton, however, this report says, was that she was investigating ISIS and resending to her “readers/followers” copies of “electronic documents” (Tweets) proving Clinton’s US State Department was funneling weapons to these terrorists from Libya.

This report notes that from US news reports Ms Yassin has been a longtime independent journalist investigator examining various controversial issues such as chemtrials, genetically modified foods, the dangers of vaccines as they pertain to autism, and was a frequent reader of longtime “conspiracy theory” reporters Alex Jones and David Icke.

Living as a shut-in with her father and two children in Buffalo, Missouri, this report continues, Ms Yassin rarely left home because she is severely disabled from a spinal injury and depends upon a catheter (inserted medical device for releasing urine from the bladder) in her daily life—but whom when she began re-Tweeting ISIS documents showing Hillary Clinton’s crimes in arming them, was put under daily surveillance by the FBI with them charging her, on 11 January, and her trial scheduled to start on 19 September.

SVR analysts contributing to this report state that Mr Yassin’s “motive/reason” for investigating Hillary Clinton’s links with ISIS related to her Christian belief that the “end times” might be near—and that was explained by Audrey Alexander, a researcher at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, who noted that her postings might be confusing to other ISIS supporters due to her originality: “She is questioning whether ISIL is the end of times army. That’s something that a lot of the community doesn’t necessarily latch onto, which is why we believe her views are quite well informed.”

Though Ms Yassin’s aunt, Sandra Mick, told authorities “The real story is, she’s not a terrorist. She retweeted and reposted what other people had posted, that’s the story. She’s never been outside this country. I doubt she’s even met a real Muslim”, her cousin, Janice Valenti, asserting that she is a Christian who teaches her two children Bible verses, and the US Federal Judge at her bail hearing stating “when it comes down to it, she is a disabled woman who poses no physical threat [to] herself and to anyone else”, this report sadly notes, Obama-Clinton forces have been able to keep her jailed and separated from her young children, and even worse, have still refused to turn over to her defense attorneys the evidence they claim to have against her.

To the fullest horror, however, of what Hillary Clinton has planned for Ms Yassin, this report says, is the Obama regime planning to silence her under what is called Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) that will deny her the ability to see any evidence against her, her attorneys not allowed to offer any defense of any kind, and is an exact duplicate of the Show Trials used to silence dissidents in the former Soviet Union.

To how the American people themselves are reacting to this disabled young mothers torture by Hillary Clinton, this report continues, cannot be known as the Obama regime supported press still remains silent about this case that puts all of these peoples lives in jeopardy—as now any of them who re-Tweets, or in other way, forwards information the US considers subversive can now be jailed for the rest of their lives.

As to what Hillary Clinton is most fearful about, this report says, is the American people discovering the tens-of-millions of dollars she has been given by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, the over $165 billion in arms she gave them too while Secretary of State, as the Wikileaks Cablegate emails prove, and all for the single purpose of destroying Syria and Iraq in order for these Arab states to build natural gas pipelines across in order to achieve the ultimate goal of destroying both Russia and China.

To the only hope Ms Yassin, or for that matter the American people, has, this report concludes, is Donald Trump—who this past week became the highest positioned figure in the US to join with the independent journalists truthfully telling these people that Obama-Clinton are, indeed, the founders of ISIS, and who, also, by the most accurate, and honest, accounting made yet of the upcoming presidential election, is showed to be winning by a landslide.

237,"Sanofi SA said Tuesday that it will further its investment in U.S.-based Translate Bio Inc. to pursue new mRNA vaccines aimed at broadly addressing infectious diseases.

Translate Bio will receive $425 million in upfront payments, consisting of a $300 million cash payment and a $125 million investment in private placement common stock at $25.59 a share.

Translate Bio is also eligible for other payments up to $1.9 billion. Sanofi will receive world-wide rights to develop and commercialize infectious disease vaccines using Translate Bio's technology, the French pharmaceutical company said.

1040,"THE first coronavirus vaccine has reportedly been completed by scientists at a genetic engineering company in Texas.

Scientists at Greffex Inc, which has a corporate headquarters in Houston and a laboratory in Aurora, Colorado, say they finished developing the vaccine this week.

Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updates

However, it could still be two years before the vaccine is available to use.

It now needs to be tested in animal experiments before human trials can begin.

The development comes as the death toll hit 2,247, and cases of the virus reached 76,727 across the world.

Greffex's company president and CEO John Price told the Houston Business Journal that they did not use a living or killed virus to form the vaccine - for safety reasons.

The coronavirus is so poorly understood, has spread so quickly and has killed enough people that scientists at Greffex did not want to risk exposure that could trigger the deadly illness known as COVID-19.

Instead, adenovirus-based vector vaccines, which are widely employed against various infectious diseases or cancers, were used.



 Adenoviruses are among the most common causes of viral respiratory infections, accounting for between two and five per cent of colds.

""The trick in making a vaccine is can you scale the vaccine that you’ve made to be able to make a certain number of doses, can you test that vaccine quickly and efficiently and then can you get it into patients,"" Price told local outlet KHOU 11.

""And that’s where we have an edge as well on the other companies that are out there.”

The vaccine is the product of an $18.9 million (£14.64 million) contract Greffex received in September 2019 from the National Institute of Health’s National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, aimed at fighting infectious threats, the Business Journal reported.

Coronavirus is an airborne virus, spread in a similar way to colds and the flu. Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches. It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes. In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus. But if a coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract (your windpipe and your lungs), it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems. There is no vaccine currently available for coronavirus. In 2003 an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than 8,000 people in 37 countries before it was brought under control, killing 800 of those worldwide.

If the vaccine wins government approval in the US, Greffex will give it away for free to the hardest-hit countries, Price said.

More than 2,100 people have died as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, with all but 11 of those deaths in mainland China.

Worldwide, more than 75,700 people have been infected.

In England, a total of nine people have tested positive for the virus, while more than 5,000 have tested negative.

It’s getting ugly out there on social media.

Anti-vaccine activists are attacking pediatricians head to head on Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms, and they’re not hesitating to make their attacks personal.

A few fed-up doctors are fighting back, both online and, more recently, in the courts.

One pediatrician, Dr. Eve Switzer of Enid, Oklahoma, filed a defamation suit last year against former Oklahoma ophthalmologist Jim Meehan and Oklahomans for Vaccine and Health Choice, saying they publicly and falsely accused her of failing to provide informed consent to parents about vaccinations.

“Anti-vaxxers have gotten out of control,” Switzer told NBC News.

“As a pediatrician, the way that it has affected me personally, my practice and my staff, even, I really felt like I needed to have some sort of remedy and my only remedy was a legal remedy.”

It's difficult enough to counter the continual questions raised by vaccine skeptics and activists who, increasingly, say all vaccines are unsafe for all children.

Worries about autism, a preservative called thimerosal, the spacing of vaccines, vaccine ingredients and whether kids get too many vaccines have all been repeatedly and thoroughly addressed, but that doesn’t stop users of social media from bringing them up again and again.

“Going up against the anti-vaccine movement is a thankless task for a number of reasons. For one, the goalpost is moving,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.

“So if you can explain why MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine doesn’t cause autism, they’ll turn around and say well it must be thimerosal in vaccines. If you debunk this, then they’ll say ‘well we are spacing vaccines too close together’ and if you debunk that and then it’s aluminum in vaccines,” he added.

Using social media takes it to a new level.

Just as online media allow people to stay in their own political echo chambers, viewing and sharing only their own beliefs, use of social media is allowing vaccine skeptics to harden their messages. Facebook feeds offer continual validation with video after video of parents who say they believe vaccines gave their children eczema or asthma or even killed their babies — claims made with no medical backing.

And on Twitter, any post about the benefits of vaccines — all supported by decades of science — is often immediately attacked.

Most recently, a Detroit-area mother jailed for a week for refusing to follow a court order that involved vaccinating her kids got an instant support group. Although the judge in the case, Circuit Court Judge Karen McDonald, made it clear the sentence was about disregarding a court order that Bredow had initially agreed to, Bredow herself and anti-vaccine groups framed it as having taken a stand for her beliefs.

In reality, there is no legitimate debate about the safety or benefits of vaccines. While no medical group claims vaccines are 100 percent safe, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and dozens of academic researchers independent of the federal government have shown the benefits of vaccines both to individual children and adults and to the population at large.

“Childhood vaccination saves up to 3 million lives every year, but 1.5 million people still die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by vaccines,” the nonprofit Sabin Vaccine Institute says.

But you might not know that if you take a look at social media.

“It’s more systematic and more aggressive and more effective,” said Hotez, who is also a pediatrician, the parent of a young woman with autism, and a vocal advocate for vaccination.

“There’s a new element to the anti-vaccine group that has sort of an alt-right flavor to it.”

Theodore Tomeny of the psychology department of the University of Alabama and colleagues tracked Twitter activity and found more than 270,000 tweets containing anti-vaccine statements between 2009 and 2015 — half of all the tweets they found about vaccines in general.

California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania were particularly rich in anti-vaccine Twitter users.

“We found that anti-vaccine sentiment seems to be prevalent on Twitter,” Tomeny said. “It also seems to cluster geographically. We observed spikes over time that seemed to be associated with current events like one of the recent measles outbreaks in California.”

They not only repeat untrue rumors about vaccines, but accuse government and academic doctors of colluding with pharmaceutical companies to cover up the dangers of vaccines, without real evidence to back up these accusations.

Pediatricians, public health experts and others would do well to monitor this type of social media use and counter its influence, Tomeny and colleagues wrote in the October issue of the journal Social Science & Medicine.

The instinct for some may be to just turn them off.

“Thank god for the mute and block function,” Hotez said. But Hotez says it’s also important to counter some of the more viral wrong stuff.

Related: Detroit Mom Jailed, But Was it Really About Vaccines?

“I think it’s very important to get the facts out there. So I have put a lot of effort into explaining why vaccines don’t cause autism,” he said.

“The argument that measles is not dangerous — I think that is important to refute. The allegation that I am making millions of dollars off my vaccine — I think it’s important to refute that.”

Texas Children's took over work from the Sabin Vaccine Institute to develop vaccines to prevent parasitic diseases such as hookworm and schistosomiasis. “They don’t seem to understand that these are vaccines for the world’s poorest people that will never make any money,” Hotez said.

It’s not difficult to find personal attacks against Hotez on the internet, including blogs that outright call him a liar. Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia is a veteran of such personal attacks that even extended to threats against his kids.

But with universal access to social media giving a platform to anyone with a smartphone, any pediatrician who is vocal about the anti-vaccine movement, or who even posts something public about the benefits of vaccines, can be targeted.

Tomeny said it may be the impersonal aspect of social media. “Perhaps it’s the fact that it is not face-to-face communication,” he said.

“You are not having to view the other person’s reactions and temper your statements based on it.”

Switzer has found that to be the case. While she finds it easy to answer polite questions from parents in her office, she’s had a different experience online.

“Most of what I get that’s confrontational is on social media,” she said.

“This is a group of people who when I say anti-vaxxers, these are the people I am talking about — the people who are confrontational. They adamantly believe that vaccines aren’t safe or effective. They really prefer to perpetuate myths about them, things that science just doesn’t support.”

New parents who may not be familiar with the medical evidence may hear some of these claims and wonder if they are true.

“Sometimes all it takes is implanting that teeny little bit of doubt into a parent,” Switzer said.

“So if we ignore these anti-vaccine people with all of the nonsense that they are putting on social media, I really feel like that it gives them a greater voice. I think more pediatricians should be involved in putting stuff out on social media to counter the misleading and just blatantly false information that they use.”

So Switzer is not only taking the case public. She’s also suing, and another group of pediatricians say they have filed a formal complaint again Meehan with the Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure.

“We, the undersigned, wish to file a formal complaint against James C. Meehan, MD, for his unprofessional behavior on social media directed at each of us,” the complaint reads. It's signed by eight physicians and medical students, including Dr. Christopher Johnson, a pediatric critical care specialist in Santa Fe who lists a torrent of abusive tweets from Meehan in the complaint, as well as Dr. Alastair McAlpine of Red Cross Children's Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, also a Meehan target.

Lyle Kelsey, executive director of the board, said he could not confirm or deny that the report had been filed until the board decided to investigate, a process, he said, that could take months.

But it’s not hard to find Meehan’s combative posts on Twitter.

“The level of ignorance & amount of misinformation parroted by these medical doctors should & will haunt them as the truth of harm is exposed,” Meehan says in one. Meehan, an ophthalmologist by training, says he now has a “wellness” practice in Tulsa.

“Scott, only a bottom of the med school class, weak, bought, anti-science, vax pusher look (sic) you would argue there is no debate re vaccines,” Meehan blasts in another directed at Dr. Scott Krugman, chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at MedStar Franklin Square Medical Center in Perry Hall, Maryland.

“I will not be engaging, but this is a nice example of what this crew does to pediatricians on a daily basis,” Krugman said.

Meehan is just as combative in person. “No one wants to debate me,” he told NBC News.

Hotez said it’s fruitless to enter a debate when facts are disregarded.

And, he and other experts point out, the anti-vaccination arguments are doing real harm. Earlier this month a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed measles outbreaks are probably caused by people failing to vaccinate their children.",mainstream,M0bdf2,vaccine.autism
244,"""Then, by the beginning of 2021, we hope to have a couple hundred million doses,"" Fauci said during a live Q&A with the Journal of the American Medical Association.

However, it's still not clear whether the vaccine will be effective against the novel coronavirus.

Fauci said the first vaccine candidate, made by biotech company Moderna in partnership with NIAID, should go into a final stage of trials in volunteers, known as Phase 3, by mid-summer. Preparations at national and international sites are already under way, he said.

""The real business end of this all will be the Phase 3 that starts in the first week of July, hopefully,"" Fauci said. ""We want to get as many datapoints as we can.""

Phase 3 will involve about 30,000 people. The vaccine will be tested in people ages 18 to 55, as well as in the elderly and in people who have underlying health conditions. ""It's going to be the entire spectrum,"" Fauci said. With big talk and hurled insults, the gloves come off in the race for the coronavirus vaccine Fauci said Phase 2 of the trial started a few days ago. A few hundred volunteers will be involved in that part of the trial. The plan is to manufacture doses of the vaccine even before it is clear whether it will work, making close to 100 million doses by November or December, Fauci said. If it does work, then it can be deployed quickly. Scientists should have enough data by November or December to determine if the vaccine works, Fauci said. Coronavirus pandemic: Updates from around the world The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine trial under way in the UK will follow a similar schedule. A handful of other vaccine studies should start just one to two months after that, he said. ""I'm cautiously optimistic that with the multiple candidates we have with different platforms, that we are going to have a vaccine that will make it deployable,"" Fauci said. He is optimistic, he said, because, while the number of deaths from Covid-19 are ""profound,"" largely people recover from this disease. Recovery shows that there is an immune response that can clear the virus. ""Which tells us, that if the body is capable of making an immune response to clear the virus of natural infection, that's a pretty good proof of concept,"" Fauci said. ""Having said that, there is never a guarantee."" Social distancing and masks reduce risk of getting Covid-19, review finds Indeed, even with 10 vaccines already in clinical trials and more than 120 more in development, many experts are skeptical that a vaccine will be available early next year. Key trial phases can be delayed, and ultimately, the vaccines being tested now may not protect people against the virus. Millions of vaccine doses manufactured ahead of time could be thrown out. Fauci noted he's also concerned about what the durability of the immune response will be. People develop antibodies to fight common colds caused by other strains of coronavirus, but that protection generally only lasts about a year. That might mean people would need a fresh vaccine every year, as is the case with influenza. Fauci said there is also a ""major push"" under way on programs to develop monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin. These are all treatments that employ antibodies, like vaccines do, but deliver them directly, provide more temporary protection, and can also potentially treat Covid-19 symptoms. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. Fauci said he would like to see treatments developed using monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma that would protect the elderly and those who are at risk for the worst symptoms of Covid-19.

• HOSPITAL SPECIAL: The human stories behind the headlines
• JESSE LINGARD'S HOME WORKOUT: Can you keep up?",mainstream,M0875d,vaccine.covid
380,"(CNN) Abie Rohrig had just turned 18 when he told his mom he would be donating a kidney to save a stranger's life. Her answer: No you're not. He did it anyway -- the organ went to a man about his age -- and his mom was so inspired she went and donated a kidney herself.

So Rohrig expected her to understand when he told her that, for the benefit of humanity, he may volunteer to become infected with Covid-19

It turns out ""she's more worried than she was about the kidney thing,"" said Rohrig, now a 20-year-old college student who lives with his parents in a New York City apartment.

""She was like, 'What? What? I don't know,'"" he said. ""She's skeptical.""

Rohrig is one of more than 16,000 people -- most of them young adults -- who have signaled their support for a controversial method of speeding up the development of a vaccine by intentionally infecting dozens of volunteers. The signees of the online registry -- a new website called 1 Day Sooner -- have all checked a box next to the statement: ""I am interested in being exposed to the coronavirus to speed up vaccine development.""

The practice is called a human-challenge study -- or controlled human infection study -- and it can truncate a conventional vaccine study by several months. The reason: Rather than waiting for months to assess what percentage thousands of vaccine-trial volunteers get infected with the disease in question while leading their day-to-day lives, a challenge trial is much simpler, in that it exposes about 100 volunteers directly to the pathogen -- via syringe, cocktail, mosquito bite or nasal spray after an experimental vaccine or placebo is administered. (If the Covid-19 study comes to fruition, experts say it would likely be administered by nose drop.)

But if it's high reward, it's also high risk: Although Covid-19 is a much more deadly disease for the elderly and the compromised than healthy young adults, it is an unpredictable pathogen that has put star athletes in the hospital. What's more, should something go wrong, treatment options are limited.

However, with the disease still raging after having killed more than 82,000 Americans and 291,000 people worldwide since it first appeared in China late last year, some say a riskier-than-normal study is justified.

Co-authored by Nir Eyal of Rutgers, Marc Lipsitch of Harvard, and Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the piece concluded that while a human challenge study would not be without risks, ""every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally.""

""It's an idea that is controversial when people hear about it for the first time,"" Eyal, a bioethicist, told CNN. ""However, we show that if you select people in the right way and conduct the trial in the right way, it's surprisingly low risk and certainly within the bounds of what we already approve.""

Such a study would ultimately need the blessing of the US Food and Drug Administration.

But the researchers' call for a challenge study has since been propelled by the popular support of those who have indicated on 1 Day Sooner -- which is incorporating as a nonprofit organization -- that they'd be willing guinea pigs. (This is just an informal expression of interest, not a binding contract.)

The site, which was inspired by the scholarly article, launched in mid-April and is premised on the claim that shaving even one day from the long-distance race for a Covid-19 vaccine could save up to 7,120 lives.

What a human challenge study for coronavirus could look like

At some point, should a group of researchers decide to seriously explore the matter, the site would ask prospective volunteers to fill out pre-qualification questionnaires that would divulge more of their medical history, region of residence and other information that would help determine eligibility, said 1 Day Sooner's co-founder Josh Morrison.

The researchers would then screen those forms for the most eligible applicants and would eventually seek approval from a research or medical center to host the study, he said.

Morrison is a former corporate lawyer who gave up life in the fast lane to start a nonprofit organization called Waitlist Zero, which matches prospective kidney donors with recipients. Because business is at a near-standstill in the kidney-transplant world, Morrison found himself with a lot of spare time.

""I was like sitting at home in my apartment in New York City, just kind of depressed,"" he said.

Morrison came across the Journal article while noodling around on the internet.

""And I thought, 'Well, would I want to do this?'"" he said. ""I'm pretty young, 34, and in good health. And so I thought, 'Yeah, I think I would.'""

An FDA spokesperson told CNN that the agency would work with those who are interested in conducting human challenge trials to help them evaluate ethical and other issues.

""A formal determination about any specific human challenge trial proposal would be made by the FDA in the context of all the information that is available at that time,"" Michael Felberbaum wrote in an email.

Conventional vaccine trials typically consist of three phases -- the first, in which fewer than 100 participants are dosed to determine the safety; the second, in which the number of participants ramps up into the hundreds; and the third, in which the study is broadened to include thousands of people.

Typically, in that third phase, the participants return to their daily lives, and researchers -- over a period of months -- compare rates of infection between the placebo and test groups.

A human-challenge trial can replace a third phase, the Journal article says, short-circuiting the timeline by several months because researchers don't have to wait for participants to get infected the organic way -- by interacting with people at work, at school, in houses of worship or in homes. Instead, they expose the volunteers to the pathogen right then and there, in the lab.

A challenge trial can also serve as a bridge to a Phase 3 study, helping researchers determine which vaccine candidates are most promising; or it can pave the way for provisional licensure in emergency situations.

For a Covid-19 trial of the sort that 1 Day Sooner is advocating, the setup would likely entail first injecting an experimental vaccine into the arms of about 50 volunteers and a placebo into 50 others, challenge-trial experts told CNN. Two to four weeks later, all 100 would be exposed to the virus -- perhaps via nose-drop.

Human-challenge studies aren't new. They have played a key role in the development of several vaccines, including ones for malaria, flu and dengue.

Without human-challenge studies, a new vaccine for typhoid couldn't have been brought to Zimbabwe on a provisional basis last year, human-challenge experts told CNN.

The ""FDA approved a cholera vaccine simply on the basis of a human challenge,"" said Dr. Robert Read, an infectious-disease expert in the UK.

The difference is that those diseases came with fewer unknowns than Covid-19, and clinicians running the trials were able to offer medical treatments -- such as antibiotics or antivirals -- to infected patients exhibiting symptoms.

And although the idea of conducting a human-challenge trial for Covid-19 is catching on in the science community, some experts have raised serious concerns about safety.

Read, head of clinical and experimental sciences at University of Southampton, points out that Covid-19 remains a mysterious pathogen, and researchers can't give volunteers an accurate sense of the risk associated with getting intentionally infected.

""You do have to be able to describe what you know of what could happen to them if they undertake a controlled infection, with complete clarity and honesty,"" said Read, who has himself conducted challenge trials -- he recently infected dozens of volunteers with whooping cough in search of a more effective vaccine. ""And I think lots of volunteers, when faced with the information, would probably not consent to it.""

Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health -- who has led a human-challenge trial for dengue and worked on another for malaria -- said she would be interested to hear how some prospective volunteers would respond to these reports of ""cerebral vascular accidents.""

""Millennials don't think they are going to get sick from this,"" said Durbin, who, like Read, is open to the idea of human challenge trials for Covid-19, but stresses that it is incumbent upon researchers to fully evaluate the risks of such a model and to share them to the fullest extent possible with prospective participants. ""We see lots of young people in the hospital on ventilators.""

Volunteers have different reasons for signing up -- some altruistic, some pragmatic

Rohrig said the frightening spate of young Covid-19 patients having strokes was news to him.

""That's jarring,"" he said. ""I know there is a non-trivial risk.""

And yet, Rohrig said he's almost certainly up for it.

""I know that there are risks, and if I were to do this, and it were to go poorly, then that would be terrible, my family would be really sad,"" Rohrig said. But ""someone has to step up. It seems like this just needs to happen.""

Not all of the prospective volunteers are in their 20s.

John Gentle, an entrepreneur in Alabama, turns 41 on Thursday. He has a wife and four kids. Like Rohrig, Gentle believes a challenge study would afford him a chance to make a societal contribution to the vaccine effort. But as the owner of a business that has him visiting warehouses and flying regularly, he figures he'll inevitably get infected -- so he might as well get it over with.

""I feel if I did it under a controlled environment, and I had an adverse reaction, my chances are much better in a controlled environment than I didn't know I had it for a week until something had deteriorated to the point I realized,"" Gentle said.

Indeed, human challenge studies occur in tightly controlled settings. The report in the Journal of Infectious Diseases advises keeping the subjects in isolation for several weeks and guaranteeing them access to the state-of-the-art facilities of the health system, should the need arise.

""As a part of being in the trial they would be guaranteed excellent care if they needed it,"" Lipsitch, a Harvard epidemiologist, told CNN. ""Of course, you would expect nobody in the trial on average would need it, but averages don't always play out.""

Over the years, he said, he has infected some 600 students with the disease. They typically ingest the disease via a sodium-bicarbonate drink resembling Alka-Seltzer and go home. There, they await the symptoms of typhoid -- for the study participants they include headache, fever and constipation -- which generally kick in within four or five days. At this point, he said, the volunteers with symptoms are given a regimen of antibiotics, which clear up the symptoms in a couple of days.

""We have extensive follow-up data and have not had any long-term problems identified,"" Darton said in an email. ""The model is safe and reproducible and is a model of mild symptomatic illness only.""

Today's standards for human-challenge trials are rigorous. Durbin of Johns Hopkins points out that it takes a minimum of six months of prep work to responsibly carry out a human-challenge trial.

This is in part because a suitable strain of the virus -- and the proper dosage -- must be developed in a lab outfitted with high biosafety standards. Also, researchers must find medical centers that are willing to house the participants in isolation for the duration of the study and provide first-rate care to anyone who falls seriously ill.

""I think it's very important that you plan for these studies now ... and you get it right,"" Durbin said. ""Yes, it may take time for a good human challenge model to be developed, but if we wait too long to develop it, then I think the moment has passed.""

Caring for volunteers can get tricky

One of the trickier aspects of a challenge study is compensation. Pay too little, and the study may fail to attract candidates; pay too much, and people could be enticed by the money without thinking of their safety.

The latter scenario played out with the yellow-fever trials, in which a participant who was hoping to start a farm in Cuba said it was a ""cold-blooded business decision."" The May 7 article in Science -- which concludes that the extraordinary nature of the Covid-19 pandemic warrants laying the groundwork for controlled human-infection trials -- recommends ""several thousand dollars.""

Seema Shah, a bioethicist and associate professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine -- and an author of the Science article -- said participants of a recent 40-day human-challenge study for malaria were paid about $2,300.

""Some were very motivated by the money, but others were also interested in the experience, and still others have strong motivations to help others,"" she said, adding that some participants personally knew sufferers of malaria and some even donated some of their earnings to charities.

The article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases likens the act of volunteering for a human-challenge trial to other public-service endeavors -- such as volunteer firefighting or organ donation.

""People are willing to take on life-threatening risk for other people's benefit and often not just as a job but as a form of altruistic behavior,"" Lipsitch said. ""We not only encourage that, but we completely depend on that in many sectors of our lives.""

Still, the onus is on the researchers to ensure that the participants stay safe.

""What keeps me up at night,"" said Durbin, ""is if I administer a challenge agent to somebody, and that person gets seriously ill or dies -- that's on me.""",mainstream,M09fbb,vaccine.covid
247,"An Oxford University vaccine considered likely to come online this year may not be available to British people first, its lead scientist has suggested.

Prof Sarah Gilbert, whose team is receiving UK Government funding, said on Sunday that it is focused on providing protection against the virus ""as widely as possible across the world"".

Human trials for the vaccine are due to start this week, and Prof Gilbert has previously said she is 80 per cent confident it will work, and that a million doses could be available by September.

However, asked twice by Andrew Marr whether British people would be first in the queue for it, she said: ""There are discussions going on about mechanisms for ensuring fair access to all vaccines that work at a global level.""

Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, on Sunday moved to temper public expectations, saying: ""All new vaccines that come into development are long shots. Only some end up successful. Coronavirus will be no different and presents new challenges. This will take time.""",mainstream,M08855,vaccine

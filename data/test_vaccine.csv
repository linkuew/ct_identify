564,"Ousted Health and Human Services scientist Rick Bright is accusing HHS Secretary Alex Azar of continuing to retaliate against him in his new position at the National Institutes of Health. In early May, Bright filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was removed from his original role after he pushed to vet and to limit drug treatments often touted by President Trump.

In an amended whistleblower complaint, Bright claimed that Dr. Gary Disbrow, who replaced Bright in an acting capacity as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), told an HHS employee that Azar said ""if anyone were to help Dr. Bright be successful, 'there would be hell to pay.'""

Disbrow, with whom Bright said he had a ""positive relationship for nearly ten years,"" reportedly told the employee that ""Azar's staff was 'watching them closely.'""

Disbrow denied Bright's claims on Thursday night. ""I did not make any of these statements and Secretary Azar has never spoken to me in the manner alleged,"" he said in a statement. ""I have also never instructed any BARDA employee not to talk to Rick. In fact, I had a conversation with him yesterday about how to collaborate between RADx and BARDA. I am confused by these untrue statements and allegations, which distract from the important work we are doing in response to the coronavirus.""

HHS spokesman Michael Caputo also denied the allegations on Twitter, writing, ""Once again, more misleading claims from Rick Bright. His whistleblower complaint is filled with one-sided arguments and misinformation that have been completely debunked.""

Bright has repeatedly linked his removal from BARDA to his stance on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Bright said the drugs were ""promoted by the Administration as a panacea, but...clearly lack scientific merit."" The drugs were granted an emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of COVID-19, and President Trump even took a course of hydroxychloroquine.

Earlier this month, the FDA withdrew the authorization because the drugs are ""unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses,"" and could have ""serious side effects,"" according to the administration.

Bright told Congress in testimony in May that ""time is running out"" to develop a nationwide strategy for combating the coronavirus pandemic and distributing a vaccine. Without such a strategy, he said he feared the pandemic would ""get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities.""

In his tenure at BARDA, Bright, who is one of the nation's leading vaccine experts, worked on the development of vaccines for the flu, Zika and Ebola. Now, in his NIH role, Bright said he's excluded from that work, and has what he characterized as an ""extremely narrow role"" in making contracts with diagnostics companies to increase their production.

In his amended complaint, Bright requested that he be reinstated as director of BARDA, that Azar recuse himself from the case and that HHS leadership stop retaliating against him.

292,"Humans are hard-wired to avoid uncertainty. But when it comes to the coronavirus crisis, uncertainty is unavoidable. Every day, we’re bombarded with ambiguous, complex, and often conflicting information. To make sense out of all this noise, the authors describe a framework for understanding different types of informational uncertainty. They then suggest several strategies for coping with that uncertainty, both cognitively (to more effectively process and make sense of information) and emotionally (to mitigate the stress and anxiety that result from uncertainty).

Will colleges and universities restart in-person classes this fall? Will there be a vaccine for the novel coronavirus soon? Will there be second wave of the virus? Do I wear a mask outside even if I plan to socially distance? How can I figure out which news sources and leaders to trust?

Every day we are faced with a torrent of information from news articles, cable networks, social media, the White House, the Center for Disease Control – and yet, there are no clear answers.

As humans, we innately find uncertainty to be an aversive state and are motivated to reduce it, even at a cost. Research has shown that people are calmer and less agitated when they know they are going to receive an electric shock than when they know there is a 50% chance they might receive an electric shock. Similarly, the threat of perceived job insecurity has more detrimental health effects than actually losing a job.

Feeling uncertain is not a natural state of being for us — it signals to the brain that things are not right. The brain then seeks out information to resolve the uncertainty. This desire for resolution is why feelings of uncertainty lead us to process information more systematically and deeply in the hope of finding answers.

But the coronavirus pandemic leaves us in a quandary: Our natural instinct is to try to resolve our intense feelings of uncertainty, but there is so much uncertainty around the virus and its effects that a quest for complete resolution is futile. So what can we do?

First, it is important to understand that uncertainty is multi-dimensional. There are at least three types of uncertainty: probability, ambiguity, and complexity. To cope with each, we have identified several strategies, both cognitive (to more effectively process and make sense of information) and emotional (to mitigate the stress and anxiety that result from uncertainty).

Probability uncertainty refers to situations in which it is difficult to ascertain risk levels: Not only do you not know what will happen, you also don’t know how likely each outcome is. For example, how much am I really at risk compared to others in my group? People of my age? People where I live? People who behave like me?

As a cognitive coping mechanism, the first thing to do is to understand that you are at risk as much as any other member of your group. Research shows that people tend to underestimate their own risk of contracting a disease or encountering a negative event. This is a self-positivity bias, that needs to be overcome. Recognize that you are as much at risk as everyone else, and focus on what you know you can do to reduce risk by complying with expert recommendations (e.g., wash hands often, wear facial coverings in public, maintain social distancing). Don’t be that person who gets yelled at in a grocery store for not wearing a mask!

Emotionally, it is important to embrace that you are at as much risk as the people around you and empathize with them on this common ground. Connect virtually (or in person with appropriate social distance, if allowed) with people you care about, whether they are friends, family or neighbors. Accept that we’re all in the same boat and we’re all doing our best to get through this together.

Ambiguity uncertainty refers to situations in which we are faced with imprecise, insufficient, or conflicting information. For example, we were told that the virus could be transmitted through hard surfaces such as cardboard, plastic, metal, etc. Now the CDC believes that the virus is mostly airborne and that the chances of contracting the virus through surfaces is very small. What does that mean for my behavior? Can I get the virus from not just someone’s cough, but if they speak to me? Is six feet of social distancing enough to protect myself?

As a cognitive coping mechanism, consolidate the different sources of information and try to get clarity through what social scientists call triangulation (i.e., using multiple measures or methods to ensure that they all converge on the same result). Rely most on information that is reported consistently through multiple reliable sources. But also understand that the coronavirus is novel, and that the science around it keeps evolving. So sometimes we need to find a non-cognitive approach that does not involve trying to resolve uncertainty.

Cope emotionally by knowing when it’s time to end the search for more information. Sources such as the CDC warn against information overload: “Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting.” Recognize that the endless search for clarity can create more stress than it alleviates, and sometimes enough is enough.

This occurs when an issue is technically complex and difficult to understand: For example, for non-statisticians, it can be hard to understand what “flattening the curve” really means, why it’s important, and how to balance different factors such as resource constraints, geographical variances, and economic considerations. Is it true that a week’s delay in lockdown in March led to a loss of 36,000 lives? And now, how is each state or county making the decision to reopen, and how are they balancing economic loss against the loss of human life?

As a cognitive coping mechanism, consult an expert source well versed in the field to break down complex information into understandable nuggets. Make sure to find sources grounded in science, not partisanship. And again, recognize when the quest for information is helpful, and when it isn’t. Maybe what’s needed right now is not to understand the details of each epidemiological model, but instead to just understand what actions we need to take to be safe. Simplify the complexity into an actionable piece of information (e.g., wear a mask when going outside).

If this gets too overwhelming, cope emotionally by finding ways to escape the complexity: Re-watch a favorite TV show, knit a blanket, or organize your closet by color. Or if you can, escape your own stresses by making this world a little less stressful for others: Donate to your local food bank, support your local businesses, or even bail someone out of jail.

Taking these steps to mitigate informational uncertainty will leave you with the mental bandwidth to cope with the many other important issues we all face. And in these trying times, it’s best to take every chance you get to unwind and find some moments of zen.",mainstream
270,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new government study adds to the evidence that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative until recently found in many vaccines, does not increase children’s risk of autism.

It shows kids who had been exposed as babies to high levels of the preservative — through vaccines they received or their mothers received while pregnant — were no more likely to develop autism, including two distinct subtypes of the condition.

“This study should reassure parents about following the recommended immunization schedule,” said Dr. Frank Destefano, director of the Immunization Safety Office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, and the study’s senior author.

Concerns about a link between vaccines and autism were first raised more than a decade ago by British physician Andrew Wakefield.

His report, based on 12 children, has since been discredited and was retracted earlier this year by the journal that published it. In the meantime, it sparked a fierce worldwide debate among scientists and a health scare that caused many parents to shy away from recommended vaccines like the one against measles, mumps and rubella.

Outbreaks of all three diseases followed.

One widespread worry has been that thimerosal might play a role in the development of autism, a condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children, according to the CDC.

Most scientists consider autism a developmental disorder, likely influenced by genes.

Autism spectrum disorders range from mild Asperger’s Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability, and there is no cure or good treatment.

The CDC researchers used data for U.S. children born between 1994 and 1999, who were enrolled in one of three managed care organizations.

They found 256 children with an autism spectrum disorder and compared them with 752 children who did not have the condition, but were matched for age and sex.

No matter when a child had been exposed to thimerosal — before birth when the mother had a shot, or when the child itself was vaccinated as a baby or toddler — there was no increase in the risk of any type of autism spectrum disorder.

In fact, those kids who were exposed to the preservative between birth and 20 months of age had slightly lower odds of developing the condition, although the researchers could not explain that result.

“This is a very reassuring study,” said Dr. Michael J. Smith, a pediatrician at the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Kentucky who was not involved in the research.

“These data show that you could receive a thimerosal vaccine and not be concerned about it.”

Smith, who said he has a fully vaccinated two-month-old at home, noted that autism rates have continued to rise, although thimerosal has been removed from all routine childhood vaccines, except flu shots.

For parents who remain concerned about thimerosal in the flu shots, he said there are alternatives without the preservative, such as FluMist, a nasal spray that can be used in children aged two and older.

Some parents have also worried that giving too many shots at once, or in children who are too young, could cause mental problems. Smith said studies had dispelled those concerns one by one.

“There is no credible evidence” for a link between vaccines and autism, he told Reuters Health.",mainstream
120,"In an explosive new report, famed investigative reporter Bill Gertz details how an unsecured, low-level Chinese laboratory near Wuhan, China, had isolated and was studying viruses in bats just before the Covid-19 virus began to spread among residents in the bustling Chinese city. If true, the claim could provide scientists with clues as to how a common respiratory illness in bats jumped from animals to humans before spreading like wildfire across the world.

According to the latest reports, Covid-19, which it is believed originated in or around Wuhan, China, population 11 million, is now present in 151 countries around the world. As testing ramps up in more countries, the United States now leads the world in confirmed cases, with over 164,000 confirmed cases.

Writes Gertz, “Several Chinese state media outlets in recent months touted the virus research and lionized in particular a key researcher in Wuhan, Tian Junhua, as a leader in bat virus work.”

Gertz quoted Rep. Michael T. McCaul, Texas Republican and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. McCaul said China should be held accountable for the pandemic.

“This is one of the worst cover-ups in human history, and now the world is facing a global pandemic,” McCaul added.

According to Gertz, a video has been posted online that was funded by the Chinese government. In it, Tian can be seen inside caves in Hubei province near Wuhan taking samples from captured bats and storing them in vials.

“I am not a doctor, but I work to cure and save people,” Tian reportedly says in the video. “I am not a soldier, but I work to safeguard an invisible national defense line.”

An article by “JQKNews.Com” published online in February 2020 discussed a Chinese documentary on Tian’s work collecting specimens from bats in 2019.

Here is an excerpt from that article:

In a documentary released in December last year, Tian Junhua has been out in the daytime and at night in the past decade. He has visited dozens of bat caves in Hubei Province and collected precious bat virus samples. “In the past ten years, we have visited every corner of Hubei Province, explored dozens of undeveloped caves and studied more than 300 kinds of virus vectors,” Tian said. “If our skin is bare, it’s easy to get in touch with bat feces, pollutants,” he said. The researchers wore protective clothing, goggles, masks, headlights, [and had] flashlights. “We are well prepared for this unknown adventure.” This is a war without gunpowder. In the film, two researchers armed [sic], climbed the rugged cave wall to remove the captured bats. A staff member wearing gloves grabbed the bat. Tian Junhua put the collected samples of the bat into the specimen box and then put the bat back into the cave. In May 2017, a report by Xinhua News Agency described Tian’s work: “The environment for collecting bat samples is extremely bad. There is a stench in the bat cave. Bats carry a large number of viruses in their bodies. If they are not careful, they are at risk of infection. But Tian Junhua is not afraid to go to the mountain with his wife to catch Batman.” Tian Junhua summed up the experience that the most bats can be caught by using the sky cannon and pulling the net. But in the process of operation, Tian Junhua forgot to take protective measures. Bat urine dripped on him like raindrops from the top. If he was infected, he could not find any medicine. It was written in the report. The wings of bats carry sharp claws. When the big bats are caught by bat tools, they can easily spray blood. Several times bat blood was sprayed directly on Tian’s skin, but he didn’t flinch at all. After returning home, Tian Junhua took the initiative to isolate for half a month. As long as the incubation period of 14 days does not occur, he will be lucky to escape, the report said We don’t know if Tian Junhua has been so lucky on bat-catching. But scientists have shown that bat viruses can infect people directly, without the need for so-called intermediate hosts.

Most microbiologists dismiss the belief that the virus was manufactured in a lab, arguing that viruses do on occasion jump from animals to humans on their own such as in the case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which is passed from camels to humans, or the swine and the avian flu—especially when humans and animals live in close proximity to each other, as is the case in Asia.

Gertz’s report, however, could shed light on how this particular virus jumped from bats to humans before morphing into a global pandemic.

At this time, scientists believe they have identified as many as eight different subtypes of Covid-19.

A report in USA Today published March 27 documents these different strains, noting that there is good news to be found in this.

“The SARS-CoV-2 virus first began causing illness in China sometime between mid-November and mid-December,” reported USA Today. “Its genome is made up of about 30,000 base pairs. Humans, by comparison, have more than 3 billion. So far even in the virus’s most divergent strains scientists have found only 11 base pair changes.”

That is good news for scientists and healthcare workers. Finding a cure for one virus is a lot easier than finding cures for eight—or even more—different ones.

According to this report, scientists believe they have located patient X for the United States.

“Most cases on the U.S. West Coast are linked to a strain first identified in Washington state,” reports USA Today. “It may have come from a man who had been in Wuhan, China, the virus’s epicenter, and returned home on Jan. 15. It is only three mutations away from the original Wuhan strain, according to work done early in the outbreak by Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at Fred Hutch, a medical research center in Seattle.”",conspiracy
595,"Pharma is looking to reset its image with COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, but landmines loom—with pricing likely the biggest.

The halo from pharma’s rapid response in research and discovery—and the hope that a vaccine or effective treatments will allow the world to return to some sort of normal—has propelled the industry’s reputation at an all-time high. Forty percent of Americans say their opinion of the pharma industry has turned positive during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to The Harris Poll.

However, pricing lurks just beyond the lab. Just this week in media, one well-known pundit posited in a Forbes column that the industry’s reputation hinges on the pricing of Gilead Sciences' treatment remdesivir, while another touted Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla’s promise to not price its vaccine too high in part because “people will not forget if you do that.”

Yet in the same Axios article, Bourla is quoted as saying the vaccine represents a “huge commercial opportunity” for Pfizer. Industry experts say it’s a safe bet that other pharma companies are wrangling with the same contradictory issues.

RELATED: Can the price be right? With the world watching, Gilead faces a no-win decision on remdesivir

Stewart Lyman, a biotech and pharma consultant, said while scientists and researchers will be satisfied with just the discovery of a vaccine, executives at the top of pharma companies will likely want more.

“I suspect they will be very sensitive to not gouging because there will be both political pressure and pressure from the other companies to not do that this one time,” said Lyman, who is also a former scientist at Immunex, now owned by Amgen.

“(But) they’re going to be looking for something in return,"" he added. ""Exactly how that gets sorted out, I don’t know, but one can easily imagine a quid pro quo of some type where they say ‘yes, we’re giving this to you for cheap but let’s not have any price controls’” on other drugs in the future.

The Harris Poll Managing Director Rob Jekielek said pricing alone, whether Gilead's remdesivir or vaccines, hasn't been the key to pharma's improved reputation during the pandemic. Pricing has been a top three issue in Harris Poll surveys since March, but vaccines and treatments—especially vaccines—are what's driving the hockey-stick spike in the industry's reputation.

The bigger pricing issue will be affordability once vaccines and treatments are released, he said, although as he pointed out, that will be a more integrated issue across industries including pharma, insurance, pharmacy benefit managers and others.

""If a vaccine or treatment exists, but Americans can’t afford to get it, especially the most vulnerable or at risk populations—for example, lower income, minority, or living in more densely populated areas—it will likely be a major issue,"" Jekielek said.

Of course, pricing isn’t the only hurdle pharma companies face in navigating their reputations through developing and delivering COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.

Managing expectations—for instance, avoiding overpromising and underdelivering on a vaccine's timeline—is another important consideration, said N. Craig Smith, the chaired professor of ethics and social responsibility at INSEAD graduate business school in France.

Smith pointed to global access to vaccines and treatments, along with manufacturing and distribution issues, as other challenges. He co-authored an MIT Sloan Management Review article about the liability of the pharma industry's competition-based model in COVID-19 drug development.

“There are still questions around how drugs and vaccine get made available, who gets them first and what prices are charged, but I do think there’s a great opportunity here for the industry to come out looking a whole lot better than it has in recent years,” Smith said.

Safety and efficacy of the medicines is yet another consideration. While Operation Warp Speed in both name and effort seems to be focused on speed, Lyman said, safety and efficacy are both more important.

“Coming up with and launching a vaccine fast—but one that is neither safe or efficacious or is just one of those—would be an unmitigated disaster,” he said. “Not just for the COVID-19 programs, but for every other vaccine made these days. Because then you’re going to get people afraid, pushed by these anti-vaccine groups, and starting to question the safety and efficacy of other vaccines.”

RELATED: One COVID-19 opportunity for pharma? A chance to bolster its reputation, Lilly CEO says

Jane Sarasohn-Kahn, a health economist with THINK-Health and blogger at Health Populi, agreed about the vaccine concerns. She has already begun to see shifts in opinions in the past few weeks as the pandemic wears on.

“There’s been an erosion in public support in the U.S. for vaccines—we’ve seen challenges in getting people signed up into trials, and a growing chasm between folks who would plan to take advantage of a COVID-19 vaccine versus those who would not,” she said in an email.

Still, pricing is top of mind not just for pharma companies but for government officials. Consumer pricing bills in both the U.S. House and Senate seek to limit companies from profiting during national emergencies. That includes drug companies and would impose a 10% profit margin for treatments or vaccines.

However, Anthony Fauci, M.D., head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned at BIO this week that “the federal government shouldn’t force drug companies to lower the costs of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments but should encourage fair pricing,” according to a Bloomberg report.

Where does that leave the industry? In a delicate spot. As Forbes contributor John LaMattina summed up in his column about the importance of Gilead's pricing decision, saying that it “will set the tone for the Covid-19 vaccines and drugs that will follow. It will also impact the reputation of the whole industry. It’s not an easy decision. Let’s hope they get it right.”",mainstream
905,"Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics.

Childhood vaccines protect children from a variety of serious or potentially fatal diseases, including diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis) and others. If these diseases seem uncommon — or even unheard of — it's usually because these vaccines are doing their job.

Still, you might wonder about the benefits and risks of childhood vaccines. Here are straight answers to common questions about childhood vaccines.

Is natural immunity better than vaccination?

A natural infection might provide better immunity than vaccination — but there are serious risks. For example, a natural chickenpox (varicella) infection could lead to pneumonia. A natural polio infection could cause permanent paralysis. A natural mumps infection could lead to deafness. A natural Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection could result in permanent brain damage or even death. Vaccination can help prevent these diseases and their potentially serious complications.

Vaccines do not cause autism. Despite much controversy on the topic, researchers haven't found a connection between autism and childhood vaccines. In fact, the original study that ignited the debate years ago has been retracted.

Any vaccine can cause side effects. Usually, these side effects are minor — a low-grade fever, fussiness and soreness at the injection site. Some vaccines cause a temporary headache, fatigue or loss of appetite. Rarely, a child might experience a severe allergic reaction or a neurological side effect, such as a seizure. Although these rare side effects are a concern, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm or death is extremely small. The benefits of getting a vaccine are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children.

Of course, vaccines aren't given to children who have known allergies to specific vaccine components. Likewise, if your child develops a life-threatening reaction to a particular vaccine, further doses of that vaccine won't be given.

Why are vaccines given so early?

The diseases that childhood vaccines are meant to prevent are most likely to occur when a child is very young and the risk of complications is greatest. That makes early vaccination — sometimes beginning shortly after birth — essential. If you postpone vaccines until a child is older, it might be too late.

Is it OK to pick and choose vaccines?

In general, skipping vaccines isn't a good idea. This can leave your child vulnerable to potentially serious diseases that could otherwise be avoided. And consider this: For some children — including those who can't receive certain vaccines for medical reasons (such as cancer therapy) — the only protection from vaccine-preventable diseases is the immunity of the people around them. If immunization rates drop, vaccine-preventable diseases might once again become common threats.

If you have reservations about particular vaccines, discuss your concerns with your child's doctor. If your child falls behind the standard vaccines schedule, ask the doctor about catch-up immunizations.

436,"Legendary gold and market expert Jim Sinclair says the virus that originated in China may have, oddly enough, done some good. Sinclair explains, “The effect of the coronavirus was literally to shut down business globally, therefore, shut off the demand for loans, which also shut off demand for short term money. So, what the public has not seen, is not considering and does not understand is we were stepping into the door of a major financial crisis magnitudes larger than what happened in 2008 and 2009. It’s a horrible thing that this virus occurred, but if it had not occurred, we would have been in a crisis much more serious than 2008 and 2009. . . . It was blowing sky high . . . . Shutting down demand is all we could do. It stopped the explosion of interest rates.”

Where do we go from here? Sinclair says, “We are going to make a recovery. It’s not going to be a ‘V’ by any means. The stock market could be a ‘V’ because the stock market has very little to do with reality. . . . As far as business is concerned, very serious damage has been done to the infrastructure to the business equation. Many employers are gone. Many corporations have significant readjustments to be able to build up again. The supply lines and logistics, where did everything come from? China. . . . This is a major worldwide adjustment, both economically and politically. . . . We had everything made in the cheapest place possible. . . . This is not a passing phenomenon. . . . The only thing that has been steady is gold. . . . The change that this brings about is a reconstruction of the basic business foundations. It’s a start over, it’s not just a slowdown. How many restaurants make money on 50% of the clients? You can’t. How many automobiles have built up on the lots? Enormous amounts. How many clothing stores shut down full of winter clothes and can’t make the shift to summer wear? You can go down the entire line. So, this recovery will be more like an ‘L’. We’ve come straight down, and we are going to go sideways now. . . . Many businesses are not going to open up again. . . .The idea of the coming inflation as a result of this is simple. Everything that you need will go up in price. Everything you don’t need is not going to hold value. You are better off with a freezer full of fine cuts of beef than you are with a brand new Tesla. The beef will go up in price, the Tesla will go down.”

On gold, Sinclair says the ultimate price is an easy-to-calculate math problem. How much gold does America have compared to how much debt it has? So, how high could gold ultimately go? Sinclair says, “It’s simple math. You take the amount of gold the U.S. says it has, and then you take the debt it has, and what price would you need for the debt to balance to zero? The price on the low end is $50,000 per ounce. The true price is $87,500 per ounce.”

Is a biblical debt jubilee coming to America? Sinclair says, “We already have jubilees. If you don’t pay your rent, you have a jubilee. If you don’t pay your student loan, you have a jubilee. If the payment of your auto insurance is postponed, you have a jubilee. We’ve got jubilee after jubilee after jubilee. Keep in mind, one man’s jubilee is another man’s disaster. It’s almost as if the Bible is correct in terms of economics. Also, keep in mind, the people who aren’t being paid are being hurt very badly.”

Sinclair thinks the recovery will take a decade or longer, and Sinclair says, “It will be just like the period between 1929 up to WWII (1941).”

Sinclair did call back in and said his power was knocked out for a short while. He also added, “I will give the re-election of President Trump a 50/50 chance.

417,"Gold prices ended lower on Monday, giving up earlier gains that had lifted prices toward their highest levels since 2012, as early positive results from a COVID-19 vaccine prompted a rally in the U.S. stock market, dulling haven demand for the precious metal.

“Gold sold off on upbeat trader attitudes after the Moderna news of a positive initial result from a Covid-19 vaccine test,” Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco.com, told MarketWatch.

Biotechnology company Moderna Inc. MRNA, announced positive results from a Phase 1 clinical trial for its experimental mRNA coronavirus vaccine.

The U.S. stock market jumped right away on the news, “suggesting keener risk appetite in the marketplace. That is usually bearish for safe-haven gold, Wyckoff said.

Gold for June delivery on Comex GC00, US:GCM20 fell by $21.90, or nearly 1.3%, to settle $1,734.40 an ounce, marking its first loss in five sessions. It had touched an intraday high of $1,775.80, which put the metal near its highest settlement since 2012. Last week, gold gained 2.5% based on the most-active contract at Friday’s close.

“After a torrid run higher in the first half of April, gold spent the next few weeks digesting those gains by trading sideways in an ever-tightening pattern,” said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter. “This pattern indicated a looming breakout, and that’s just what we got late last week as gold powered through upside resistance on Thursday and Friday.”

“After gold’s breakout last week and the seeming likelihood of another big run higher, those holding big gold short positions were increasingly desperate to defend them, and the good news on a potential vaccine provided a great entry point,” he told MarketWatch.

Meanwhile, July silver SIN20, surged 39.8 cents, or 2.3%, at $17.468 an ounce, after rallying by 8.2% last week.

Gold bullion has marked mostly rangebound moves from a high of $1,788 to a low of $1,676 an ounce in recent weeks but has been underpinned by worries about the harm to the global economy from the COVID-19 pandemic and the monetary-policy response by central banks to limit the impact of business closures, which were only recently being undone.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said during a CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Sunday that the central bank was still able to deliver more stimulus as needed to help alleviate problems for the economy.

“We’re not out of ammunition by a long shot,” Powell said.

Other metals traded on Comex settled higher, with July copper HGN20, up almost 3.2% at $2.404 a pound. July platinum PLN20, rose 6.4% to $869.30 an ounce and June palladium US:PAM20 ended at $2,027.10 an ounce, up 9.1%.

In a note Monday, analysts at Zaner Metals said palladium has found support “from analyst predictions that very slow and gradual returns to production will balance the market” from the demand lost due to the pandemic.",mainstream
639,"The docking complex of the construct vaccine and TLR5 is described.

Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS‐COV‐2) emerged which is responsible for the recent outbreak in Wuhan, China. Genetically, it is closely related to SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV. The situation is getting worse and worse, therefore, there is an urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the SARS‐COV‐2. Here, we characterized spike glycoprotein to obtain immunogenic epitopes. Next, we chose 13 Major Histocompatibility Complex‐(MHC) I and 3 MHC‐II epitopes, having antigenic properties. These epitopes are usually linked to specific linkers to build vaccine components and molecularly dock on toll‐like receptor‐5 to get binding affinity. Therefore, to provide a fast immunogenic profile of these epitopes, we performed immunoinformatics analysis so that the rapid development of the vaccine might bring this disastrous situation to the end earlier.

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS‐COV‐2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China.1 It has a positive‐sense single‐stranded RNA as their genetic component and shares genome similarity with SARS‐CoV and bat coronavirus,2, 3 79.5% and 96% respectively. Phylogenetically, it belongs to the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales and is a β‐coronavirus of 2B group.4 Regarding epidemiology, human‐to‐human transmission of the virus through the sneezes, cough, and respiratory droplets has been confirmed, yet the zoonotic nature has not been confirmed.5-7 Epidemiologic investigation in Wuhan, China identified an initial association with a seafood market where most patients had worked or visited.4 However, as the outbreak progressed, several confirmed cases were reported sporadically all over the world, showing the pandemic nature of the disease named as COVID‐19. At last, on 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.8 According to the situation report 35 (reported by 24 February 2020) of WHO, in China, 77 262 confirmed cases were reported, of which 2595 cases were with deaths. Moreover, outside of China, 2069 confirmed cases were reported in 29 other countries (https://www.who.int/docs/default‐source/coronaviruse/situation‐reports/20200224‐sitrep‐35‐covid‐19.pdf?sfvrsn=1ac4218d_2). Therefore, as the situation was getting worse and worse, the need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the SARS‐COV‐2 was growing. Our work was to find suitable epitopes, which can generate enough immune response against the SARS‐COV‐2 infection. Using immunoinformatics, we could recognize and characterize potential B and T‐cell epitopes for the generation of the epitopic vaccine against SARS‐COV‐2.9 Specifically, the spike glycoprotein of SARS‐COV‐2 is considered as the target because it forms a characteristic crown of the virus and protrudes from the viral envelope.10 So, the protein sequence of spike glycoprotein was explored thoroughly using multiple immunoinformatic‐based servers and software, to identify various epitopes for an effective vaccine.

The amino acid sequence of the targeted protein on SARS‐COV‐2 was collected from the National Centre for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) database.11 The protein sequence is very crucial for identifying the potential epitopes of the targeted protein. In this subsection, we used the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to identify linear B‐cell epitopes using the incorporated BepiPred 2.0 prediction module.12, 13 We provided the FASTA sequence of the targeted protein as an input considering all default parameters. T‐cell epitopes having the binding affinity towards MHC‐I and MHC‐II alleles were selected to boost up both cytotoxic T‐cell and helper T‐cell mediated immune response. We adopted two servers which are ProPred‐I and ProPred server to the selection of MHC‐I and MHC‐II binding epitopes respectively within preidentified B‐cell epitopic region.14, 15 The selected epitopes were submitted to the VaxiJen v.2.0 server applying a virus as a target field with the given threshold value of 0.4 for analyzing the antigenic propensity.16 With the help of a specific peptide linker, we fused the antigenic epitopes to construct an effectual vaccine component. Later, the vaccine component was modeled in the SPARKS‐X server.17 An adjuvant was also added with the vaccine component to accelerate the adaptive immune responses. The vaccine model passed through two different servers ProSA‐web and PROCHECK—in a subsequent manner for evaluating the structural accuracy of the model.18, 19 Molecular docking is the most promising part of the modern drug‐discovery method. Here, in this study, we adopted PatchDock (Beta 1.3 Version) docking server to receptor‐ligand docking.20 PatchDock server analyzes the molecular docking between the vaccine component and the toll‐like receptor (TLR)‐5. The generated Protein Data Bank (PDB) file of the protein‐peptide docking complex was visualized in PyMOL software v.2.3.21

Spike glycoprotein of SARS‐COV‐2, retrieved from the NCBI has the GenBank accession ID: QHR63290.1. This spike glycoprotein has 1282‐long amino acid sequences and this sequence was downloaded in a FASTA format to carry out the further process. We obtained a total of 34 sequential linear B‐cell epitopes of varying lengths from the IEDB server within spike glycoprotein of SARS‐COV‐2. Those B‐cell epitopes were placed into Table 1 based on their positional value, sequence, and length. In Figure 1 the yellow‐colored peaks represent the epitopic region, while the green‐colored slopes, represent the nonepitopic region. List of linear B‐cell epitopes along with their sequence, position, and length Graphical representation of linear B‐cell epitopes within the spike glycoprotein of SARS‐COV‐2 We identified 29 MHC‐I epitopes and 8 MHC‐II epitopes, which fall within the preidentified B‐cell epitopic region. Among them, 13 MHC‐I epitopes and 3 MHC‐II epitopes had the antigenic propensity, according to the VaxiJen v.2.0 server analysis. The MHC‐I and MHC‐II epitopes are listed in Tables 2 and 3 with encountering MHC alleles and antigenic scores. List of epitopes with encountering MHC‐I alleles, positional value, and VaxiJen antigenic score List showing the epitopes with encountering MHC‐II alleles, positional value and VaxiJen antigenic score In this study, we linked the 13 MHC‐I and 3 MHC‐II antigenic epitopes with (EAAAK) linker peptide to construct a vaccine component. This linker peptide was easily fused with the virus coat protein and increased stability as well as folding of the vaccine component.22 The predicted structure of the vaccine component is shown in Figure 2. It has 90.0%, 7.1%, 1.6%, and 1.3% residues in most favored, additionally allowed, generously allowed and disallowed regions respectively within PROCHECK as the validation server to generate Ramachandran plot. Using the ProSA server, the “Z ” score was −3.82 and most of the residues had negative energy value as shown in Figure 3. Results from both servers indicate the model is in a good quality.23, 24 Different molecular characterization of vaccine model. (a) All atoms at Ramachandran plot, (b) “Z ” score plot of vaccine model in ProSA server, and (c) all residue energy plot The PatchDock server provided 20 docking complexes, and among them, we selected only the docking complex with the highest negative atomic contact energy (ACE) value for analysis. The ACE value of the docking complex was −259.62, which indicates spontaneous reactivity between the vaccine component and TLR‐5.25 As proper protein‐protein docking regulates the cellular functions, the docking between the vaccine component and TLR‐5 will activate immune cascades for destroying the viral antigens.26 The selected docking complex is shown in Figures 4 and 5, along with molecular surface interaction as well as some bonding interactions.

The SARS‐COV‐2, the causative pathogen for respiratory distress syndrome, led more than 10 000 people to infection all over the world, even several to death. After first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, the COVID‐19 disease spread unchecked which finally became a global threat. Scientists from all over the world are struggling to find a solution to this evil outbreak. In our present study, we attempted to find out various B‐cell and T‐cell epitopes against SARS‐COV‐2, using the immunoinformatics, as quick identification of B‐cell and T‐cell epitopes is crucial for designing of vaccine component against this disease. The spike glycoprotein was analyzed for B‐cell epitope identification in the IEDB server, and 34 linear B‐cell epitopes were identified as a result. Subsequently, the sequence was also analyzed in ProPred‐I and ProPred servers for the identification of the T‐cell epitope that can combine with MHC‐I and MHC‐II molecules. Fortunately, we found 29 epitopes against MHC‐I and 8 epitopes against MHC‐II that can be possibly used for vaccine. Unfortunately, antigenic characterization in VaxiJen v.2.0 discarded 16 MHC‐I epitopes out of 29 and 5 out of 8 MHC‐II epitopes as these seemed to be nonantigenic in nature. Nevertheless, we converted the antigenic epitopes into a single vaccine component, using (EAAAK) peptide linker. Later, the vaccine component was modeled in the SPARK‐X server and validated in PROCHECK and ProSA. A total of 90% of nonglycine and nonproline residues presented within the most favored region, while the “Z ” score of the model was −3.82. These results from both servers indicate the model is in good quality. Molecular docking between vaccine component and TLR‐5 showed significant ACE value, which indicates spontaneous reactivity within the receptor‐ligand complex. All the observations of our present work depict the effectiveness of selected epitopes within the spike glycoprotein of SARS‐COV‐2. These epitopes can be used to make an immunogenic multi‐epitopic peptide vaccine against SARS‐COV‐2.

Present immunoinformatic analysis pointed out 13 MHC‐I and 3 MHC‐II epitopes within the spike glycoprotein of SARS‐COV‐2. These epitopes are the ideal candidate to formulate a multi‐epitopic peptide vaccine, not only because of being selected from the linear B‐cell epitopic region but also because of their antigenic property was confirmed. Moreover, the molecular docking of vaccine components with the TLR‐5 proves the significance and effectiveness of these epitopes as an ideal vaccine candidate against SARS‐COV‐2. However, these immunoinformatic analyses require several in vitro and in vivo validations before formulating the vaccine to resist COVID‐19.",mainstream
259,"The day after data appeared from the vaccine maker Sinovac showed complete protection of rhesus monkeys by their vaccine candidate (whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles), scientists from the Jenner Institute in Oxford issued a press release announcing that their vaccine (an adenovirus vector based vaccine that carried the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) worked to protect rhesus monkeys and that they were moving forward with large scale human safety trials. At the time, the substantiating data was not available. Now it is, in the form of a May 13 BioRxiv preprint. Does the data support the claim?

Not really. All of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged, as judged by recovery of virus genomic RNA from nasal secretions. There was no difference in the amount of viral RNA detected from this site in the vaccinated monkeys as compared to the unvaccinated animals. Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected. This observation is in marked contrast to the results reported from Sinovac trial. At the highest dose studied, no virus was recovered from vaccinated monkeys from the throat, lung, or rectum of the vaccinated animals.

There is a second troubling result of the Oxford paper. The titer of neutralizing antibody, as judged by inhibition of virus replication by successive serum dilutions as reported is extremely low. Typically, neutralizing antibodies in effective vaccines can be diluted by more than a thousand fold and retain activity. In these experiments the serum could be diluted only by 4 to 40 fold before neutralizing activity was lost. Again, by contrast the titer of neutralizing antibodies in the serum of those vaccinated with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was high.

What then is the argument for pressing forward with the adenovirus vector SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccine?

The authors present evidence to the effect that, although the vaccine did not protect the animals from infection, it did moderate the disease.

The vaccinated and control animals were followed for clinical signs of infection for seven days post infection. One clinical sign of infection in rhesus monkeys is breathing rate. Monkeys ill from SARS-CoV-2 infection breathe more rapidly than normal. By this measure 3 of the 6 vaccinated monkeys were clinically ill, the remaining three were not clinically distinguishable from the unvaccinated animals.

A second test is measurement of the amount of virus in the lungs (bronchial lavage). Viral RNA was detected in the bronchial lavage of 2 of the 6 vaccinated animals and in all three unvaccinated animals, again suggesting only partial protection.

At day seven post challenge the animals were euthanized and examined for lung damage. Two of the three unvaccinated animals “developed some degree of interstitial pneumonia” as judged by pathological examination of the lungs. No such damage was observed in any of the vaccinated animals.

It is encouraging that no evidence of vaccine induced disease enhancement was observed in either the Sinovac vaccine nor the Oxford trials. However, experience with other vaccines tells us that is not a firm guarantee that such will be the case for humans.

What to make of this data? It is crystal clear that the vaccine did not provide sterilizing immunity to the virus challenge, the gold standard for any vaccine. It may provide partial protection.

The question then becomes: Will partial protection be enough to control the COVID-19 pandemic? That is an open question. For an answer we can look to other diseases for which only partially effective vaccines exist—HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The answers are not encouraging, except perhaps for the protection of childhood malaria.

What are the potential implications for other vaccine trials? We know adenovirus is a good vector for eliciting protective responses for protein coding genes of other viruses, in fact better than many others. This then raises the question of whether vaccine strategies based on the delivery of viral antigens by nucleic acids, be it DNA or RNA, will suffice. From the published data the nucleic acid of select viral genes and proteins delivery technology seems inferior to a whole killed virus vaccine approach.

What then are the choices for the Oxford group? Steam ahead with a vaccine known to be partially effective at best, one which we already know elicits poor neutralizing responses? Work to improve the immunogenicity of the current vaccine? Attempt trials with combinations of two or more vaccines, a prime boost strategy?

These questions are all the more fraught by what we already know about the complexities of antibody reposes to natural infections. For example, we know in the case of SARS and other coronavirus infections that even high titers of neutralizing antibodies fade quickly over time. How long can we expect weakly neutralizing antibodies to protect?

We know what the public response is of the Oxford group and their collaborators. Proceed with full speed to human safety then efficacy trials. Time will tell if this is the best approach. I wouldn’t bet on it.",mainstream
625,"On the backdrop of novel coronavirus (COVID‐19‐SARS‐CoV2) creating a pandemic situation and creating some desertion of the city of Wuhan, China, the epicenter, it is an emergent need that the medical and scientific community undertake quick measures. This virus has made social, political, economic, financial, medical, and scientific fraternity to go in a state of emergency. The spread of the virus has been as fast as the dissemination of fear and false news. Rapid isolation measures taken have restricted the spread, yet it may be premature to say if they were delayed.

WHO declared coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) outbreak as pandemic on March 12, 2020.

The virus responsible for COVID‐19 disease is SARS‐CoV2. It was on February 11, 2020, that the international committee on taxonomy of viruses announced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as the name of this new virus earlier called novel coronavirus (nCov).

Coronavirus belongs to the family of coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales . There are four groups of coronaviruses (Zhu & Zhang, 2020): alphacoronaviruses infect mammals (human coronavirus NL63), Betacoronaviruses infect mammals (SARS CoV, MERS CoV, Bat CoV), gammacoronaviruses infect birds (avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus), deltacoronaviruses infect both birds and mammals (porcein delta CoV). Four viruses 229 E (alpha), UC 43 (beta), NL 63 (alpha), and HKU1 (beta) cause common cold symptoms. COVID‐19 is a betacoronavirus (Zhu & Zhang, 2020). Bat coronavirus HKU4 is also a betacoronavirus. It is a large (27–32 kb), enveloped, positive‐stranded RNA virus. Its viral genome is packed inside a helical capsid formed by nucleocapsid protein and is surrounded by an envelope. The virus has four proteins: membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), spike protein (S), and nucleocapsid protein (N). Spike forms large protrusions on viral surface, giving it a crownlike appearance, and hence the name corona. Spike protein mediates the entry of the virus into host cells (Lellan & Wrapp, 2020). It is also the critical determinant of viral host range and tissue tropism and is a major inducer of host immune response (Li, 2016). Spike protein is in charge of receptor binding and subsequent viral entry into the host cells. Therefore, it can be the major therapeutic target. It binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP 4) or CD 26. The former is more for SARS and the latter is for MERS. CD 209 L is the alternative receptor with lower affinity to respiratory tract (Song et al., 2019).

Scientists (Wan, Shang, Graham, Baric, & Li, 2020) have analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019‐nCoV based on the knowledge on sequencing of SARS‐CoV. They have found that the sequence of 2019 nCoV receptor binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2 receptor is similar to that of SARS‐CoV and suggest that 2019‐nCoV (Wuhan) uses ACE2 as its receptor. Their structural analysis predicted that the Wuhan coronavirus uses ACE2 as its host receptor. They have further stated that a single mutation significantly enhances the ability of nCoV (Wuhan) to bind with human ACE2 (Zhu & Zhang, 2020).

Spike protein has S1 and S2 subunits. A minimal receptor‐binding domain (RBD) is located in the S1 subunit and can combine with host cell receptor ACE2. On the RBD, RBM is located, which is responsible for complete contact with ACE2.

There is no definite treatment for COVID‐19. The most important method is to prevent viral transmission by rapid isolation and disease containment measures. As the spread of COVID‐19 is mainly respiratory in origin by droplet infection, utmost care is required with the use of personal protective gadgets, masks, assessment, and notification of true picture and prevention of spread by controlling travel and isolation, screening of individuals, and so forth. Treatment of pneumonia and acute lung injury is largely empiric.

There is an urgent need to device and develop various treatment modalities in the form of vaccine, newer drug molecules, or repurpose some of the existing drugs. The health care community and biotech industry need to take an urgent call and undertake quick clinical trials on humanitarian grounds.

Various modalities of treatment can be tried.
• Antiviral drugs—viral polymerases and protease inhibitors, which are components of the HIV and HCV antiviral regimen, find an immediate place. Lopinavir and ritonavir, which are protease inhibitors, and oseltamivir neuraminidase are under study. Remdesivir, which interferes with viral polymerase, can be tried (it has shown efficacy against MERS) (Wan et al., ).
• Vaccine trials need to be started. Antibodies raised against the S1 subunit can be protective, so can antibodies against the RBD fragment. Spike protein‐based vaccine will also produce antibodies and will offer protection. Passive antibody transfer from convalescent sera of recovered patients will have polyclonal antibodies, and their plasma can be transfused. A new idea of target viral receptor protein on cell surface ACE2 and RBD protein can be attached to an Fc fragment and can be used to attack the virus. Extracellular domain of ACE2 protein fused to a human immunoglobulin G, Fc domain may hold promise (David Fedson, ). ACE2 Fc fusion protein against COVID may neutralize the virus and prevent lung injury. It can also be used to give passive immunity to health care workers. All these are still highly experimental. An interesting paper (Hoffmann et al., ) mentions the use of a drug called CAMOSTAT acting on TMPRSS 2 protein, which could prevent viral entry as the virus uses the protein.
• Based on the structure of the virus, the presence of ACE2 as the receptor, which facilitates entry of the virus, and based on work done in SARS, ARDS, and sepsis by Fedson ( ), some treatments can be hypothesized. A large body of experimental and clinical research done on treating patients with pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis, influenza, and Ebola (with lung injury) suggest that statins and angiotensin receptor blockers might be effective in COVID‐19 infection. Statins are known to have lipid‐lowering and also anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities on cytokines, chemokines, complement cascade, and coagulation factors. Thus, the host response to COVID‐19 resulting in lung injury may be controlled with the use of statins. Hypercytokinemia is not directly associated with viral replication, but it can be variability in host response. Early use of statins could prove beneficial. Other anti‐inflammatory drugs can be used. Chloroquine is being tried too.
• We also hypothesize that the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) available for clinical use as antihypertensives can be potential drugs to be given for control of viral spread of novel coronavirus (Wuhan) infection. An unpublished observation by one of us (M.P.) is that people using losartan or telmisartan (ARB) as antihypertensives get fewer attacks of cold and flu‐like illnesses. Both these drugs also do not produce cough as the side effect so commonly seen with ACE inhibitors. Losartan and telmisartan strongly binds to the AT1 receptors more than valsartan (Phadke & Saunik, ). Therefore, the use of the former could be suitable in the treatment of coronavirus disease. The mode of administration in addition to being given orally could be in the form of a nasal spray. Published literature is scant on this information. Clinicians and scientists may consider the use of losartan or telmisartan in therapeutic doses for preventing the virus entering the host cell and spread of infection. Rapid clinical trials are the need of the hour. In mice, experimentally infected with H N influenza, treatment with ARB (Losartan) improved survival (Kruse, ).

The use of zinc supplement can help intracellular killing and phagocytosis, and can modulate immune function, and may be tried. Thus, the use of ARB (telmisartan and losartan) to be given in therapeutic doses along with zinc to control viral replication warrants attention. ACE2 receptors are widely expressed on epithelial cells of alveoli, trancheobronchial free and may help virus entry (Song et al., 2019). Therefore, the use of ARBs in the form of nebulization can be tried.

Developing scientific treatment that will target the viruses in the form of vaccines and new molecules is a “top‐down” approach, but can be time‐consuming, though eventually required. However, one can think of a “bottom‐up” approach by repurposing commonly used low‐cost generic drugs such as ARB, zinc in controlling viral multiplication, and statins to control lung injury. This, if found useful, can make an immeasurable contribution to global health, equity, and global viral security.

986,"Sao Paulo state authorities announced an agreement between the Brazilian Butantan Institute and Chinese laboratory Sinovac Biotech to conduct phase three of a clinical coronavirus vaccine trial on approximately 9,000 volunteers in Brazil starting the first week of July.

""The vaccine proved very effective at phase two. It really protected against all infections. Now we are going to do a populational test. It is a promising vaccine, without a doubt,” Butantan Institute President Dimas Covas said while speaking at a news conference Thursday.

Phase three will involve trying the vaccine on different types of people that represent the diversity of the population such as by age or ethnicity.

According to Sao Paulo´s health officials, the vaccine went through the first two phases of testing in China, where it was tested on 744 volunteers. The Chinese lab started human clinical trials with the experimental vaccine on April 17.

The agreement establishes that the Butantan Institute will own the vaccine technology to potentially mass-produce it inside Brazil; and if proven effective, it is expected to be available to the population in the first half of 2021, according to Covas.

The Butantan Institute is one of Brazil's top biomedical research centers.

The state of Sao Paulo is the epicenter of the outbreak in Brazil with 162,520 cases of coronavirus and 10,145 deaths as of Thursday afternoon. Brazil has the second highest cases in the world; the US is first, according to Johns Hopkins University.",mainstream
1122,"When a coronavirus vaccine is developed, who will be first in line to get it? A CDC panel usually decides

No matter how well-prepared we are, there won’t immediately be enough coronavirus vaccine to immunize all Americans. Choices will have to be made about who goes to the front of the line.

“It’s inevitable that the vaccine will come out more slowly than we like. We’re not going to have 350 million doses delivered day one,” said Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

To be most protective, a list of the first to be immunized must be carefully crafted based on what type of vaccine may become available, who it works best for and whether the disease is still raging.

Since 1964, the United States has relied on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to make those decisions. As soon as the Food and Drug Administration licenses a new vaccine, ACIP offers guidelines on how it should be distributed, to whom and when.

The World Health Organization has a similar group, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.

More: 'Our moon shot': The world needs a coronavirus vaccine ASAP. Despite drugmakers billion-dollar bets, one might not be available for years.

ACIP already has begun working on a plan for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The WHO group began its process last week.

“We’re starting as early as we can to deal with the torrent of data that’s coming out,"" said Dr. Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine and a current ACIP member. ""We don’t want to wait until the vaccine becomes available and begin our deliberations then.”

Typically, ACIP’s guidelines would be used without question. That became slightly less clear Friday with the announcement of a White House initiative called Operation Warp Speed.

In a news conference in the Rose Garden, President Donald Trump said the initiative would create a group of experts and bring together the CDC, National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the U.S. military to work at “record speed” to find, test, manufacture and distribute a vaccine.

Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive who Trump named to head Operation Warp Speed, said early clinical trial data from at least one vaccine candidate made him confident “we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020. We will do the best we can to do that.”

Vaccine experts have consistently urged caution in presuming a vaccine will be available soon. The White House Coronavirus Task Force's Dr. Anthony Fauci has said that while a vaccine is likely within the next year or two, the process takes time. Securing a vaccine quickly would require everything falling exactly into place, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said.

""You can rush vaccine development but only when you understand – there’s no way around it – you are trading safety for speed,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.

Few details of how coordination within Operation Warp Speed would work were provided, and it is unclear what role it will play in vaccine allocation. An unnamed government official involved with the initiative told CNN earlier this month one of the tasks of the group is to determine who gets the first doses.

The CDC referred inquiries about how the two groups would work together to the White House. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification.

Vaccine experts have spent years considering the best and most effective way to dole out immunizations. ACIP has clear and transparent guidelines on how to conduct the process available on its website, and all its meetings in which it votes on vaccine recommendations are public and webcast. The next is on June 24.

Discussions center on balancing protection for the largest number of people with protecting the most vulnerable.

“If I’ve only got 30 million doses for the next year and I’ve got a population of 350 million, who do I assign propriety to?” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at Berkeley and an internationally recognized expert on infectious disease.

Health care providers, first responders, the military, political leaders, older adults, pregnant women and children are generally put at the front of the line, depending on the disease and the vaccine, said Reingold, who served on ACIP for many years.

“All kinds of ethicists are brought to the table,” he said.

Another approach to control an epidemic is to focus on hot spots where a disease is spreading and there are high transmission rates.

""You would rush vaccine to the area, open your clinics and try to get a large proportion of the population vaccinated quickly,"" Pavia said.

For SARS-CoV-2, the devil is in the details because so much remains unknown about who it affects and how.

Vaccines differ. One may be best for healthy adults, another better for children, and a third most effective for older adults or those with preexisting medical conditions.

In the case of the new coronavirus, data might show although older people are severely affected by COVID-19, immunizing their caregivers could better protect them, depending on how effective the vaccine is for different ages.

“We think about who’s at risk for being exposed, who suffers the worst complications and which population provides the highest benefit due to herd immunity,” said Lee.

Herd immunity is when enough people in the population have been infected and developed immunity to the virus that it can no longer spread freely. Scientists' models estimate 65% of the population needs to be immune to establish such immunity and stop the spread of the disease.

So far, infection rates alone are nowhere near high enough to create herd immunity. While a national infection rate in the United States has not yet been determined, in France, an estimated 4.4% of the population is believed to have been infected with the disease as of May 11, according to a paper in the journal Science.

Whoever determines who gets inoculated first, public health experts say past experience shows the best medical conclusion isn’t always the best solution.

During a shortage of flu vaccine in 2004, it was decided that elderly people, who were at high risk, should get vaccinated first. It turned out they didn’t want it.

“They said, ‘I’d rather my grandchildren receive the vaccine,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the division of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

After health care workers and first responders are immunized, Schaffner suggested simply making a vaccine available on a first-come, first-served basis.

“Vaccine left in the refrigerator never protected anyone from anything,” he said.

Some health care professionals say Americans need to be part of the conversation about how any coming coronavirus vaccine should be doled out.

“We need to engage with the public now. You’ve got to consider public values,” said Daniel Salmon, a professor of international health who directs the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It’s not all about what the scientists think.”",mainstream
875,"‘It’s going to be hard.’

We’re also perilously far behind. The number of new cases appearing each day is swinging wildly, from 13,000 on May 19 to 24,000 the next day, even though much of the country remains locked down. And those are just the cases we know about. Until the U.S. does a far better job of quickly figuring out who is infected, it simply won’t be possible to keep up with tracing.

Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard University's School of Public Health, is pessimistic. Even if 80 percent of the country managed to trace cases effectively—“which would be miraculous,” he said—the remaining 20 percent would be a constant source of new infections. New research, not yet peer reviewed, suggests tracing would have to catch at least half of all new cases to reduce transmission even 10 percent. “My view is it’s probably not going to work,” Lipsitch said. “But given the lack of alternatives, we have to try—and hopefully demonstrate that I’m wrong.”

Tracing techniques have been honed over decades

Technology may help some this time around. Apple and Google and a half dozen other companies are developing cellphone applications that use GPS or Bluetooth technology. These apps can alert users that they were recently near an infectious person or allow them to retrace their steps to see if they crossed paths with a carrier. But most experts insist technology will merely support, not supplant, human tracing. And it may never be as effective in the U.S. as it has been in other countries.

For starters, tech solutions are valuable only if widely adopted, and polls show Americans are skeptical and worry that apps could infringe on data privacy. The U.S. also has so many cases that it can’t rely on weak crowdsourcing with limited penetration to find them all. Meanwhile, in much of Asia, previous viral outbreaks bred enough comfort and respect for tracing that there is less need for the handholding provided by human tracers. In a few countries, notably China, authoritarian governments also leave citizens little choice but to participate.",mainstream
828,"Smallpox ranks among the most devastating illnesses ever suffered by humankind. It dramatically altered the course of human history, even contributing to the decline of civilizations. Officially the deadly virus no longer exists. After a final outbreak in the United States in 1949, the virus was declared eradicated in 1980 following a successful vaccination program regarded as one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine.

Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by the variola virus. It gets its name from the Latin word for ""spotted,"" referring to the raised, pustular bumps that break out over the face and body of those affected. Historically the virus killed around 30 percent of people who caught it. Those who survived were often left blind, sterile, and with deep pitted scars, or pockmarks, on the skin.

Spread through direct contact with infected people, body fluids, or contaminated objects such as bedding, the disease had two main types. Variola major was the most common form–and most lethal. Variola minor produced a milder disease, which was fatal in less than one percent of cases. Two other, rarer forms also existed: hemorrhagic and malignant. Both invariably resulted in death.

Smallpox is thought to have originated in India or Egypt at least 3,000 years ago. The earliest evidence for the disease comes from the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses V, who died in 1157 B.C. His mummified remains show telltale pockmarks on his skin.

The disease later spread along trade routes in Asia, Africa, and Europe, eventually reaching the Americas in the 1500s. Indigenous peoples there had no natural immunity. An estimated 90 percent of indigenous casualties during European colonization were caused by disease rather than military conquest.

Smallpox contributed to the decline of the Aztec Empire, in what is now Mexico, following the virus's arrival with Spanish conquerors in 1519. More than three million Aztec succumbed to the disease. Severely weakened, the Aztec were easily defeated. Likewise, smallpox claimed the life of an Inca emperor and wiped out much of the Inca population in western South America.

In Europe, smallpox is estimated to have claimed 60 million lives in the 18th century alone. In the 20th century, it killed some 300 million people globally.

The human fight against smallpox dates back some 2,000 years. In Asia, a technique known as variolation involved deliberately infecting a person by blowing dried smallpox scabs up their nose. Those who received this treatment contracted a mild form of the disease, developing a lifelong immunity.

A key breakthrough came in 1796 when an experiment by English doctor Edward Jenner showed that inoculation using closely related cowpox could protect against smallpox. Jenner's discovery paved the way for later vaccination programs—especially crucial since there is no effective treatment for smallpox.

In 1967, a year when some 10 million to 15 million people contracted smallpox, the World Health Organization launched a worldwide eradication campaign based on vaccination. Gradually, the disease was pushed back to the Horn of Africa, and the last known natural case occurred in Somalia in 1977.

Despite being consigned to the history books, there's still a chance of smallpox coming back to haunt us—as a biological weapon. Such fears escalated dramatically in the United States following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While the risk of such a bioterror attack is considered very low, the U.S. has since stockpiled enough of the vaccine to inoculate every citizen.",mainstream
823,"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is unveiling on Wednesday her road map for lifting coronavirus restrictions across the bloc.

In a 14-page document laying out her ideas, von der Leyen says that ""although it is clear that the path back to normalcy will take a long time, it is also obvious that we cannot maintain these extraordinary restrictions indefinitely.""

She says lockdowns across the continent had proven effective, yet also precipitated a tremendous economic shock and placed a heavy burden on public life.

EU officials estimate that the eurozone economy could shrink by 10 percent this year — a drop in economic productivity not seen since the global economic crisis of the 1920s.

Ursula von der Leyen urges all 27 EU member states to coordinate their lifting of restrictions and to continue coordinating their approach to tackling the pandemic going forward.

She warns that ""insufficient coordination in the lifting of restrictions poses the risk of creating negative effects for all member states and most likely increases tensions between them.""

She admits there is no one-size-fits-all solution, but that member states should strive to inform each other of steps taken.

At the onset of the coronavirus outbreak, various EU members states had closed their borders, or imposed travel restrictions, without giving each other advance warning.

Ursula von der Leyen now hopes that the re-opening of borders over the coming weeks and months will happen in a more systematic fashion.

The EU Commission says three conditions must be met for coronavirus restrictions to be eased.

Brussels says that curfews could be lifted once national health care systems are no longer under such extreme strain, once infections rates have dropped off, and once particularly vulnerable groups are able to be provided with extra protection.

Brussels does not, however, propose a specific time plan for this.

The paper recognizes that this is fraught with danger: ""It is certain that such a gradual lifting of restrictions will lead to new infections.""

This is why, it states, developments must be closely monitored and new, possibly even more draconian measures will have to be imposed.

Von der Leyen writes that ""we will have to live with the virus until a vaccine has been developed.""

Some EU states, like Austria and Denmark, have already announced plans to lift some restrictions on daily life. Countries like France and Spain, meanwhile, are keeping strict measures in place.

And while some states have isolated themselves, others are still permitting international flights to operate.

Roughly half of all member states have declared a state of emergency, whereas Sweden, in contrast, has kept restrictions to a bare minimum.

In Germany, meanwhile, there is no universal approach among its 16 federal states to fighting the virus outbreak. In the state of Bavaria, for instance, all DIY stores have been closed to help contain the virus, while in neighboring Baden-Württemberg they're free to stay open.

The bloc's heads of the states and governments had prompted Ursula von der Leyen to draw up an exit strategy for the bloc.

She had been ready to unveil her road map last week, yet was called back by concerned governments demanding she revise the paper.

The amended paper now has a more cautious wording, and makes suggestions, instead of demands.

It appeals to all states to gradually reactivate the common market and ease travel restrictions. EU members states, meanwhile, are still to reign supreme with regard to managing public health and disease control.

At the end of the document, Ursula von der Leyen pledges to draw up a plan to kick start the bloc's economy, which was been hit hard by the coronavirus.

She says demand and production must be stimulated, and taxes possibly lowered. The paper states that ""the Commission will develop a recovery strategy that builds on a new medium-term budget plan, and a reworked 2020 action plan.""

Next week, the EU's heads of state and government will discuss the possibility of creating a European ""Marshall Plan"" to stimulate the bloc's economy recovery.

Commission President von der Leyen plans to pump hundreds of billions of euros into into the recovery effort.

1089,"There was not much in Jenny McCarthy's early career as a Playboy model and MTV star to suggest that she would become a passionate advocate for family issues, children's health and autism awareness. But the birth of her now almost 7-year-old son Evan, who developed autism early in life, changed all of that. McCarthy has become a best-selling author, first of lighter stuff like Baby Laughs and Life Laughs; then of more serious fare, like Louder than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism. (Read ""Fragile X: Unraveling Autism's Secrets."")

Now, she is releasing her fifth book  co-authored with autism specialist Dr. Jerry Kartzinel, titled Healing and Preventing Autism. The book is awfully smart when it comes to hardheaded advice for families trying to heal  or at least draw out  an autistic child. But McCarthy goes soft when she starts exploring the causes of autism, making the usual charges against the usual suspects, including nutrition, environmental toxins and, as always, vaccines. McCarthy and TIME science editor Jeffrey Kluger sparred over the causes of autism and the safety of vaccines. (See the year in medicine 2008.)

Your book points out that autism rates between 1983 and 2008 have climbed in lockstep with vaccination rates, yet childhood obesity, diabetes and even cell-phone use have soared since then, too. Why do you find causation in one and not the others?

 I'm not saying it's only the vaccines. But children are given so many shots from the moment they're born. They get multiple injections all at once, and if they fall behind, doctors put them on a catch-up schedule. Babies get the hepatitis B vaccine immediately after they're born and the only way for a newborn to contract that disease is if the mother is a carrier. Why not just screen the mother? Evan was handed to me pre-vaccinated with a Band-Aid on his foot.

Most people who blame autism on vaccines point to the mercury in the shots, yet mercury has been removed from most vaccines and autism rates continue to climb.

 We don't believe it's only the mercury. Aluminum and other toxins also play a role. The viruses in the vaccines themselves can be causing it, too.

Your collaborator recommends that parents accept only the haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) and tetanus vaccine for newborns and then think about the rest. Not polio? What about the polio clusters in unvaccinated communities like the Amish in the U.S.? What about the 2004 outbreak that swept across Africa and Southeast Asia after a single province in northern Nigeria banned vaccines?

 I do believe sadly it's going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it's their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They're making a product that's s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we'll use it. It shouldn't be polio versus autism. (Read ""New Clues to Autism's Cause."")

And yet in many cases, vaccines have effectively eliminated diseases. Measles is among the top five killers in the world of children under 5 years old, yet it kills virtually no one in the U.S. thanks to vaccines.

 People have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines. Please understand that we are not an antivaccine group. We are demanding safe vaccines. We want to reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins. If you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the f___ing measles.

Many scientists believe we're simply diagnosing autism differently now  both overdiagnosing it in kids who don't have it and spotting it better in kids who do. That makes it look like the condition is on the rise when it's not.

 All you have to do is find a schoolteacher or principal and ask them that question. They would say they've never seen so much ADHD, autism, OCD as in the past. I think we're overdiagnosing it by maybe 1%. Now you look around and there are five shadows  kids with disabilities  in every class.

You write in your book that when your son began to emerge from the worst of his autism he said that having the condition felt like being buried alive. What's the most important thing a parent can do to help draw a child out?

 Just remember that there is a very alert, bright, loving sweet child in there who simply looks like he doesn't care and can't hear you. They very much know what's going on. Evan has repeated things to me that I said to him when he was three and in his worst state. (See six tips for traveling with an autistic child.)

How do you manage the frustration or even resentment any parent would feel after pouring out so much love to a child who seems utterly indifferent to it?

 It's really, really difficult. I remember being on the floor with Evan sometimes 10 hours a day trying to get him to smile. Eventually, my mother said to me, ""Jenny, everything responds to love."" It was what my mother said that allowed me to stay on my knees with my child.

How do you balance the needs of the autistic child with the needs of the other children in the house  who are far less challenging and are rewarded for that with far less attention?

 Therapists deal with that all the time. They strongly urge that you bring the healthy kids  or what we call the typical kids  into the therapy. Get them involved with the autistic child. Also, it's absolutely imperative for the parents and the typical kids to have time by themselves, to go out to dinner or even go on vacation while someone else cares for the autistic child. When families eat at home, sometimes the autistic child will have dinner first and then watch a movie, while everyone else has dinner in peace.

What's the best prognosis for autistic kids?

 For a seriously autistic kid, the best prognosis might be getting into a mainstream school without being too much of a shadow. For a moderately autistic kid the best prognosis is full recovery.

The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), on Monday, alleged that it has intercepted a human intelligence report that the Nigeria House of Representatives leadership was poised to forcefully pass the compulsory vaccine bill without subjecting it to the traditions of legislative proceedings.

In a statement issued and signed by the spokesperson of the opposition political parties, Barrister Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere and sent to DAILY POST in Abuja on Monday, the body urged lawmakers in the lower chamber to rise against impunity.

The body in the statement alleged that a sum of $10 million was offered by the American Computer Czar, Bill Gates to influence the speedy passage of the bill without recourse to legislative public hearing, a development they averted as anachronistic, adding that the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila should be impeached if he forces the bill on members.

“Opposition Coalition (CUPP) has intercepted very credible intelligence and hereby alerts Nigerians of plans by the leadership of the House of Representatives led by Femi Gbajabiamila to forcefully and without adherence to the rules of lawmaking to pass the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill 2020 otherwise known as the Compulsory Vaccination Bill which is proposing a compulsory vaccination of all Nigerians even when the vaccines have not been discovered.

“This intelligence is coupled with the information of the alleged receipt, from sources outside the country but very interested in the Bill, of the sum of $10 million by the sponsors and promoters of the Bill to distribute among lawmakers to ensure a smooth passage of the Bill.

“This will manifest in a wishy-washy public hearing which the promoters still insist on cancelling under the pretext of containment of the spread of the coronavirus. The intelligence is that the House will under whatever guise pass the Bill tomorrow 5th May, 2020 upon resumption.

“The Nigeria opposition rejects the Bill and urges opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives to confront the Speaker of the House with these facts tomorrow at plenary and resist every plan to illegally pass the Bill.

“We have been informed that the alleged deal on the passage of the Bill was struck during a trip to Austria a few months back while the financial support for the promotion of the Bill was allegedly received last week to mobilize for a push leading to the hurried attempt to pass the Bill by any means necessary.

814,"Flu vaccine push already underway; first batch causes seizures in children

As ridiculous as it seems, retailers across the U.S. are already stocking their stores with Christmas goods. It’s all about the big commercial push, of course, since retailers make about 50 percent of their profits during the Christmas season.

Similarly, flu vaccine manufacturers generate huge profits during the Christmas season, too, and they’ve already begun shipping this year’s winter season flu vaccines to U.S. pharmacies and hospitals. Never mind the fact that the actual flu strain in the vaccine is little more than a hodgepodge collection of last year’s flu strains. Each year’s flu vaccines are technically only applicable to last year’s flu season, making them perfect for time travelers but useless for everybody else.

Along with the big vaccine push comes the inevitable vaccine propaganda. It’s all so predictable: First there’s the announcement that “everybody should get vaccinated.” This is followed by some later announcement in the pre-Christmas season of “how bad” this year’s flu season is getting. This is followed yet again by another urgent bulletin by health authorities urging everyone to get vaccinated.

The big vaccine push only quiets down when vaccine supplies dwindle. But as long as vaccines remain in inventory, the big vaccine push will stay aggressive, and during this annual charade, there won’t be a word mentioned about vitamin D and how it is far more effective than any vaccine at protecting people from seasonal flu.

This year’s vaccine push has begun with some curious admissions by the vaccine industry, reflected in a Reuters story (http://www.reuters.com/article/idUS…). After the usual explanatory text about how flu vaccine manufacturers have started shipping their largest quantity of vaccines ever produced for flu season, the story prints this curious text:

“And U.S. officials said they were changing the labeling on a vaccine made by Australia’s CSL Ltd (CSL.AX) because it appears to have caused a higher than usual rate of seizures in children.”

Now hold on a second.

If you read between the lines here, this statement implies that: 1) Vaccines cause seizures in children. And then 2) This particular vaccines causes a higher rate of seizures in children than the usual rate of seizures in children.

Why is this curious? First off, because vaccine pushers have always sworn their vaccines caused no seizures whatsoever. No neurological problems. No spontaneous abortions in pregnant women. No increased rates of autism. Vaccines are all perfectly safe, they say, and no children are ever harmed by them.

That’s the mythology, at least, behind vaccines. But the reality is far different: Vaccines do cause seizures in children, and this year’s vaccines look like they’re going to cause a significantly higher rate of seizures than usual.

Note, by the way, that this was not the headline of the story. This admission was tucked away in the text of a Reuters story, without any real emphasis. If Reuters was really interested in reporting the truth about vaccines, the story headline would have been, “Flu vaccines cause seizures in children.”

The story goes on to say, “The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone be vaccinated against seasonal flu this year.”

Yep, everyone. That means one-month old infants. Pregnant women. Children with seizure disorders. Immune suppressed seniors. Everyone!

You see, in years past, vaccines were never recommended for everyone due to well-founded safety concerns. In some people, you see, the nearly-dead viral strains used in vaccines can actually cause the very flu they claim to prevent. So the CDC has, for as long as anyone can remember, always warned certain groups to be excluded from vaccines for their own safety.

Well not anymore. Any safety concerns have been thrown out the window in the quest to push more vaccines onto more people. Billions of dollars in pharmaceutical profits are at stake here, and health officials can’t afford to let a little safety get in the way.

“Most years, seasonal influenza infects between 5 percent and 20 percent of the U.S. population and kills 36,000 people. It puts about 200,000 into the hospital.”

Well, not really. The 36,000 figure often quoted from the CDC is wildly inaccurate (http://www.naturalnews.com/026169_m…). It’s a statistical guess based on such outdated data that to quote it as fact is laughable. Besides, it’s technically wrong to say that influenza kills anyone. The real killer here is vitamin D deficiency which causes a stalled out immune system. If people had sufficient levels of vitamin D circulating in their blood, the flu virus would be powerless to harm them. And since there are viruses everywhere in the world around us every single day, isn’t it more accurate to say that the “flu season” is actually the “vitamin D deficiency season?”

Think about it: Why does the flu circulate in the winter months in North America, but the summer months (June – August) in Australia? It’s because those are the times of weaker sunlight exposure resulting in widespread vitamin D deficiencies. The flu is always around, living amongst us, just waiting for weakened immune systems so it can strike. To say that “the flu” kills people in the winter is factually wrong. It’s the vitamin D deficiency that kills people by giving the flu an opportunity to attack a weakened immune system.

This is a simple factual point that the entire system of western medicine, with all its high-IQ doctors, has so far failed to realize. Sometimes it feels like we’re still living in the Dark Ages of medicine, I swear…

Where are the clinical trials?

Anyway, this Reuters story continues with one more whopper of a statement:

“The labeling for one vaccine, CSL Limited’s Afluria, has undergone changes this season to inform health care providers about an increased incidence of fever and febrile seizure… The FDA said it was asking CSL to conduct a study of its vaccine in children.”

Read between the lines on this one: This Afluria vaccine causes an increased risk of seizures, it’s being imported into the USA to be injected in children this flu season, and the FDA is just now asking for a study? That means, of course, that no study has been conducted on this vaccine yet.

In other words, this vaccine which causes seizures in children has never actually been properly tested in children according to FDA guidelines, so the FDA wants a test to be done but the vaccine will be injected into children in the USA anyway, even before the testing is likely to be completed.

And that means, of course, that U.S. children are being used as guinea pigs to see what happens to them following this vaccine injection. If enough children have seizures or end up paralyzed or dead, the FDA will probably pull the vaccine off the market. But that only happens after the fact and after the damage has already been done.

Don’t you get it? Your children are the experiment! The American People are the guinea pigs for every vaccine these companies come up with, and it doesn’t matter if the vaccine causes seizures, brain damage or even death… American children are going to be injected by the millions in order to find out what happens.

No need for influenza vaccines in anyone

This whole annual charade is utterly useless to begin with. There is simply no medically justifiable need to inject anyone with a flu vaccine — ever! What people need is vitamin D to activate their immune response so that natural exposures to seasonal flu are easily handled by their existing immune system functionality.

Let’s face it: The human immune system is far more intelligent and technologically advanced than any flu vaccine. It already has a pattern recognition system that can identify and destroy foreign invaders in the blood. But as research has shown, when vitamin D levels are deficient in the body, the immune system is effectively paralyzed and can’t respond. (http://www.naturalnews.com/029312_i…)

When vitamin D levels are high, the immune system responds rapidly to any influenza threat. That’s why I never get a flu shot and even so, I haven’t been sick for years. I do, however, get sunshine on a regular basis, and when I can’t get sunshine, I take a quality vitamin D3 supplement. And guess what? I don’t need a flu vaccine at all. I can walk into a room full of sick people infected with influenza and be completely and utterly immune to their coughing, sneezing, nose wiping and finger-licking handshaking.

Having vitamin D in your body is like wearing a bulletproof vest for influenza.

The medical industry won’t tell you this because there’s huge profit to be made in scaring people into paying for flu shots they don’t need. If people were told the truth about the dangers and the ineffectiveness of flu shots, very few would buy them. Because the truth is that, even in best-case scenarios, flu shots are maybe effective at preventing infections in one percent of those who take them.

And that means ninety-nine percent of those receiving flu shots are wasting their time and their money. Plus, they’re exposing themselves to chemicals that are obviously dangerous to the human body or else they wouldn’t cause seizures in children, get it?

And yet every flu season, people line up by the millions to get injected with something that might harm them, and they actually pay for being potentially harmed! Why do people do this? Because they foolishly trust in health authorities who almost universally have financial ties to the vaccine manufacturing companies and so are pushing a particular agenda in order to profit from vaccine sales.

But scientifically speaking, the flu season could be stopped in its tracks by handing out vitamin D3 supplements instead of vaccine injections. No needles. No seizures. And no drug company profits.

I don’t know about you, but I’d rather swallow a vitamin than get jabbed with a sharp needle. But that’s just me.

Most other people, it seems, would rather spend their winters wiping their noses raw with Kleenex, drowning themselves in over-the-counter flu medicines and missing a week or two of work while they try to fight off a flu infection they could have prevented with a few vitamin D supplements in the first place.

Believe me, it’s a lot more fun to laugh off the flu season and spend your winters healthy, well rested and completely immune to seasonal flu.

Wanna join me in a healthy winter this year? Just boost your vitamin D levels and you too can laugh off seasonal flu and all the sheeple lining up to get injected like cattle in a branding line.

846,"At the end of the decades-long global battle to eradicate polio from the planet, there is what looks like a simple goal: Render every person immune, by vaccination, for long enough that the disease can find no host in which to breed, and thus dies out. That was the strategy behind the eradication of smallpox, and since polio like smallpox affects only humans, it is supposed to work for that disease too.

Of course, it’s a little more complicated, and a paper published last week reveals one of the most challenging complications. It describes a British man of about 30 who, as a toddler, was given the full course of polio vaccines in use at the time—and who, for 28 years, has been harboring mutated, virulent poliovirus in his guts and shedding them in his feces. The researchers who wrote about him call him, and other patients like him, “an obvious risk to the eradication program.”

Long-term shedders of poliovirus have been identified before. It’s a rare phenomenon, and for it to occur, several things have to happen: Someone has to be vaccinated as an infant with the oral polio vaccine, which contains a weakened live virus; has to have an immune-system deficiency that keeps the body from eliminating the vaccine virus after immunity develops; and, usually, has to live in an industrialized country where medical care is good enough to keep children with immune-system deficiencies alive.

That has happened a number of times—more than 70—since polio vaccination began in the 1950s, but only a few people shed virus long enough to make public health planners concerned. This man is the longest-duration shedder known, but he may not be the only one. Sampling programs that look for live poliovirus in sewage have identified mutated vaccine viruses in Finland, Israel and eastern Europe, indicating other, unidentified shedders may be out there too.

A little refresher on polio vaccines: There are two, the original injectable that uses killed virus (Jonas Salk’s original vaccine) and the oral drop version that contains a weakened live virus (Albert Sabin’s formula). The oral vaccine was the first one used in the international eradication campaign, because it is inexpensive to make and can be administered by anyone. It is still used in the developing world, though industrialized countries have gone back to the original injectable.

For all its benefits, the oral version has a known issue, a combination of bug and feature. Once it is given, the vaccine virus replicates in the gut. The feature part is that, when the vaccine virus passes out of the body, it can spread through the environment of places with poor sanitation, conferring a kind of passive secondary immunization on others nearby. The bug part is that, in the few weeks it is replicating, the vaccine virus mutates, and sometimes mutates back past the artificial weakening to the original disease-causing form.

If that reversion happens to someone who lives in an area where vaccination has been patchy, an outbreak of “vaccine-derived” polio can spark—and has, dozens of times since the campaign began. It’s happening right now in Ukraine, in fact, and the World Health Organization is negotiating with the country to begin vaccinations. (There’s an update on the index page of the eradication campaign’s site, but frustratingly it’s part of a slideshow with no static link.)

But those outbreaks have always been easy to detect, and quenched by improved vaccination. However, if the reversion happens in someone who also has an immune disorder, that person becomes a source of infectious virus that mutates continually not for weeks, but for years. And because the person is probably surrounded by other vaccinated individuals, there is no obvious outbreak to help pinpoint the problem—just a slow leak of live virus that could sicken an unvaccinated infant, a vaccine refuser, or a vulnerable immune-compromised adult somewhere else.

The British man’s problem has been known since he was a child—he was first tested in 1995, when one of this paper’s authors was studying the immune condition he suffers from—and numerous attempts have been made to chase polio from his system. None have worked. Extensive analysis of the virus he carries shows that it is virulent, paralyzing lab mice; but also that the vaccines currently in use protect against it.

However. Poliovirus comes in three flavors, strains known for simplicity as type 1, 2 and 3. The vaccines used so far in the campaign have included all three strains, but there are plans to reduce the formula to types 1 and 3 because type 2 has disappeared from the wild. The British man’s strain, however, is type 2, preserved in his system even as it was forced into extinction elsewhere. Could he, or an unlucky person like him, re-ignite an epidemic?

If the world switched from the oral vaccine to the injectable, which the international eradication campaign is planning for, the risk of random outbreaks from mutated virus would go away. The risk of existing shedders continuing to pump out virus would not—not unless vaccination continued indefinitely. The entire goal of the campaign, though, is to vaccinate the world until polio is eradicated, and then stop.

Despite years of fretting, no one has yet proposed a solution to the problem of shedders that accounts for all the complexities: the difficulty of finding them, the necessity of respecting their rights if found, the huge sunk cost of polio eradication that makes it hard to change course, and the difficult sell of achieving novel vaccines that could solve the problem but would be useful only a few years afterward. The authors who wrote up the man’s plight, though, warn that it is definitely time to begin strategizing. “[Vaccine-derived polio] from these patients,” they say, “represent a real risk of polio re-emergence in the post-eradication era.”",mainstream
230,"(CNN) - The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine does not increase the risk of autism and does not trigger autism in children who are at risk, according to a new study of over 650,000 children.

Researchers used a population registry to evaluate whether the MMR vaccine increased the risk of autism in children born in Denmark between 1999 and 2010. A total of 657,461 children were followed through August 2013, with the researchers documenting diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder as well as known risk factors including age of the parents, diagnosis of autism in a sibling, preterm birth and low weight at birth.

Over 95% of the children received the MMR vaccine, and 6,517 were diagnosed with autism. The MMR vaccine did not increase the risk of autism in children who were not considered at risk for the disorder and did not trigger it in those who were, according to the study, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

""This idea that vaccines cause autism is still around and is still getting a lot of exposure in social media,"" noted Anders Hviid, lead study author and senior investigator at Statens Serum Institut in Denmark.

With anti-vaccine groups becoming more vocal and even celebrities and politicians spreading fear of vaccines, Hviid and his team wanted to provide solid scientific answers.

The biggest contribution of the study was the inclusion of children at risk of autism, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who was not involved in the new research. He hopes the latest piece of evidence will reassure families with young children at risk of developing autism spectrum disorder that the vaccine will not increase that risk.

The myth linking vaccines and autism grew out of a 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, published in the medical journal The Lancet. Wakefield had been compensated by a law firm intending to sue manufacturers of the MMR vaccine, and in 2010, he lost his medical license. In 2011, The Lancet retracted the study after an investigation found that Wakefield altered or misrepresented information on the 12 children who were the basis for the conclusion of his study.

Several subsequent studies trying to reproduce the results have found no link between vaccines and autism.

""At this point, you've had 17 previous studies done in seven countries, three different continents, involving hundreds of thousands of children,"" Offit said. ""I think it's fair to say a truth has emerged.""

Yet the myth of a link between vaccines and autism continues to be used by anti-vaccine activists, who have been blamed for the ongoing measles outbreaks across the United States.

At least 206 US cases of measles have been recorded in 2019, after 372 cases in 2018, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Around the world, measles cases increased by 48.4% between 2017 and 2018, according to UNICEF calculations from World Health Organization data. Ten countries, including Brazil, the Philippines and France, accounted for nearly three-quarters of the total increase in measles cases in 2018.

The World Health Organization has deemed vaccine hesitancy -- the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines -- as a top 10 threat to global health in 2019.

""I think we are at a tipping point,"" Offit said. ""I think people need to realize that a choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice. It's a choice to take a greater risk, and unfortunately right now, we are experiencing that greater risk.""",mainstream
117,"Editor's note: Here's a look at all the drugs that are being tested for COVID-19 treatment.

COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, has spread to every continent except Antarctica. Not too long after the virus was first discovered at the end of December, labs turned their sights toward treatment.

Currently, however, there is no cure for this coronavirus, and treatments are based on the kind of care given for influenza (seasonal flu) and other severe respiratory illnesses, known as ""supportive care,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These treatments essentially treat the symptoms, which often in the case of COVID-19 involve fever, cough and shortness of breath. In mild cases, this might simply mean rest and fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) for comfort.

In hospitals, doctors and nurses are sometimes treating COVID-19 patients , or Tamiflu, which seems to suppress the virus' reproduction in at least some cases. This is somewhat surprising, Michigan Tech virologist Ebenezer Tumban told Live Science, as Tamiflu was designed to target an enzyme on the influenza virus, not on coronaviruses. The National Institutes of Health has begun a clinical trial at the University of Nebraska Medical Center to test the antiviral remdesivir for COVID-19, . In China, doctors are also testing an array of other antivirals originally designed to treat Ebola and HIV, .

In cases in which pneumonia inhibits breathing, treatment involves ventilation with oxygen. Ventilators blow air into the lungs through a mask or a tube inserted directly into the windpipe. A of 1,099 hospitalized patients with the coronavirus in China found that 41.3% needed supplemental oxygen and 2.3% needed invasive mechanical ventilation. Glucocorticoids were given to 18.6% of patients, a treatment often used to reduce inflammation and help open airways during respiratory disease.

There is no vaccine for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Scientists are working to develop one, Hilary Marston, a medical officer and policy advisor at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said in on Monday (March 2).

As of March 14, doctors in Seattle are recruiting volunteers to participate in a clinical trial for an experimental vaccine for COVID-19 that's being developed by the biotechnology company Moderna Therapeutics. However, biomedical ethicists are concerned that a critical step in vaccine development was skipped. In order to fast-track the vaccine, the researchers didn’t first show that it triggered an immune response in animals, a step that is normally required before human testing, .

The researchers did begin testing the experimental vaccine on lab mice on the same day they started recruiting people for the clinical trial, . The mice did show an immune response that was similar to the one triggered by an experimental vaccine for a related coronavirus MERS-CoV. (Vaccines work by priming your immune system to recognize a virus like SARS-CoV-2 as an enemy and put up an attack against it.)

Related: How this experimental vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 would work

Even so, doctors aren't sure how much this ""fast-tracking"" will speed up the time it takes to develop and bring such a vaccine to market.

Before this experimental vaccine was in the works, Marston had said not to expect a vaccine in the near term. ""If everything moves as quickly as possible, the soonest that it could possibly be is about one-and-a-half to two years. That still might be very optimistic,"" Marston said.

The novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2, causes the disease COVID-19. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31, 2019, though it seems to have been spreading well before that date. Since then, it has spread to every continent except Antarctica. The death rate appears to be higher than that of the seasonal flu, but it also varies by location as well as a person's age, underlying health conditions, among other factors. For instance, in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, the death rate reached 2.9%, whereas it was just 0.4% in other provinces in China, according to a study published Feb. 18 in the China CDC Weekly.

Scientists aren't certain where the virus originated, though they know that coronaviruses (which also include SARS and MERS) are passed between animals and humans. Research comparing the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with a viral database suggests it originated in bats. Since no bats were sold at the seafood market in Wuhan at the disease’s epicenter, researchers suggest an intermediate animal, possibly the pangolin (an endangered mammal) is responsible for the transmission to humans. There are currently no treatments for the disease, but labs are working on various types of treatments, including a vaccine.",mainstream
1134,"A race is on to find the coronavirus vaccine: Oxford University and Imperial College London have been given a combined total of £84 million by the UK government to support their research.

On 17 May business secretary Alok Sharma said it is hoped 30 million doses could be available in the UK as early as September.

But first the vaccine needs to undergo rigorous testing - including on human volunteers.

In May the first human trials began in England with 1,000 volunteers signing up to take part in the Oxford trial. Then on 16 June, Imperial College London began its human testing stage.

But both groups are still looking for 10,000 more recruits across England, Scotland and Wales.

Heres what you need to know.

Who is running the human vaccine trials?

Several countries are racing to find a vaccine for coronavirus,

In the UK, the first trials will be conducted by two universities – the University of Oxford and Imperial College London – as separate research projects.

If the trials are successful, the first vaccines could come into circulation by autumn this year.

The Oxford Vaccine Centre’s COVID-19 vaccine trial is run by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group, and is a collaborative project with several partners around the world.

Researches started working on possible vaccines on 10 January 2020 and now think they've found a suitable candidate.

The vaccine they are testing is a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector (an inactive virus) currently named ​ChAdOx1, chosen because ""it can generate a strong immune response from one dose and it is not a replicating virus, so it cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual"".

These characteristics mean it's safe to be given to children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes.

Researchers at Imperial College London have been working on a vaccine since early February.

Details of the vaccine hasn't been made public yet but is said to be a ""self-amplifying RNA vaccine"", essentially a protein that can replicate itself.

Researchers said: ""When immune cells come across these proteins, they will react by creating antibodies to fight off the danger. But they also create a lasting memory of the threat for any future attack.""

It's hoped that this vaccine will enable the body to learn to fight off the virus quicker in future.

Who can take part in the clinical trials and how can I get involved?

Oxford University started seeking healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 55 for their trials at the end of March.

They are now looking for more volunteers in the following areas: West Midlands, Thames Valley, north east of England, Southampton, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, London, Bristol, Sheffield, Merseyside, Hull, East Riding, south Wales, Cambridgeshire, Edinburgh and Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and Leicestershire.

You can find out more about the trials and sign up online.

Imperial College has also joined the Oxford team and will be running the trials in London. Separately, they are also looking to start running trials of their version of the vaccine in June.

You can sign up for the Imperial College trial online here.

As well as the human vaccine trials, it's also worth noting that the National Institute for Health Research is also recruiting volunteers for a number of other coronavirus-related clinical trials. You can find out more and sign up here.",mainstream
1056,"Freedom of Information Act in the UK filed by a doctor there has revealed 30 years of secret official documents showing that government experts have:



1. Known the vaccines don’t work

2. Known they cause the diseases they are supposed to prevent

3. Known they are a hazard to children

4. Colluded to lie to the public

5. Worked to prevent safety studies





 Those are the same vaccines that are mandated to children in the US



Educated parents can either get their children out of harm’s way or continue living inside one of the largest most evil lies in history, that vaccines – full of heavy metals, viral diseases, mycoplasma, fecal material, DNA fragments from other species, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80 (a sterilizing agent) – are a miracle of modern medicine.



Freedom of Information Act filed in the US with the CDC by a doctor with an autistic son, seeking information on what the CDC knows about the dangers of vaccines, had by law to be responded to in 20 days. 

Nearly 7 years later, the doctor went to court and the CDC argued it does not have to turn over documents. A judge ordered the CDC to turn over the documents on September 30th, 2011.



On October 26, 2011, a Denver Post editorial expressed shock that the Obama administration, after promising to be especially transparent, was proposing changes to the Freedom of Information Act that would allow it to go beyond declaring some documents secret and to actually allow government agencies (such as the CDC) to declare some document “non-existent.”



Simultaneous to this on-going massive CDC cover up involving its primary “health” not recommendation but MANDATE for American children, the CDC is in deep trouble over its decades of covering up the damaging effects of fluoride and affecting the lives of all Americans, especially children and the immune compromised. Lawsuits are being prepared. Children are ingesting 3-4 times more fluoride by body weight as adults and “[t]he sheer number of potentially harmed citizens — persons with dental fluorosis, kidney patients tipped into needing dialysis, diabetics, thyroid patients, etc — numbers in the millions.”



The CDC is obviously acting against the health of the American people. But the threat to the lives of the American people posed by the CDC’s behavior does not stop there. It participated in designed pandemic laws that are on the books in every state in the US, which arrange for the government to use military to force unknown, untested vaccines, drugs, chemicals, and “medical” treatments on the entire country if it declares a pandemic emergency.



The CDC’s credibility in declaring such a pandemic emergency is non-existent, again based on Freedom of Information Act. For in 2009, after the CDC had declared the H1N1 “pandemic,” the CDC refused to respond to Freedom of Information Act filed by CBS News and the CDC also attempted to block their investigation. What the CDC was hiding was its part in one of the largest medical scandals in history, putting out wildly exaggerated data on what it claimed were H1N1 cases, and by doing so, created the false impression of a “pandemic” in the US.



The CDC was also covering up e financial scandal to rival the bailout since the vaccines for the false pandemic cost the US billions. And worse, the CDC put pregnant women first in line for an untested vaccine with a sterilizing agent, polysorbate 80, in it. Thanks to the CDC, “the number of vaccine-related “fetal demise” reports increased by 2,440 percent in 2009 compared to previous years, which is even more shocking than the miscarriage statistic [700% increase].



The exposure of the vaccine hoax is running neck and neck with the much older hoax of a deadly 1918-19 flu. It was aspirin that killed people in 1918-19, not a pandemic flu. It was the greatest industrial catastrophe in human history with 20-50 million people dying but it was blamed on a flu. The beginning of the drug industry began with that success (and Monsanto was part of it). The flu myth was used by George Bush to threaten the world with “another pandemic flu that could kill millions” – a terror tactic to get pandemic laws on the books in every state and worldwide. Then the CDC used hoax of the pandemic hoax to create terror over H1N1 and to push deadly vaccines on the public, killing thousands of unborn children and others. (CDC will not release the data and continues to push the same vaccine.)



The hoax of the vaccine schedule is over, exposed by FOIAs in the UK. 



The hoax of the CDC’s interest in children’s lives has been exposed by its refusal to respond to a doctor’s FOIAs around its knowledge of vaccine dangers.



The 1918-19 pandemic hoax has been exposed by Dr. Karen Starko’s work on aspirin’s role in killing people.



And despite refusing to respond to FOIAS, the CDC’s scandalous hoax of a 2009 flu pandemic and its part in creating it, was exposed by CBS NEWS. 



And the Obama administration, in attempting to salvage the last vestige of secrecy around what is really happening with vaccines, by declaring agency documents non-existent, has made its claim of transparency, non-existent.



But pandemic laws arranging for unknown vaccines to be forced on the entire country are still in place with HHS creating a vaccine mixture that should never be used on anyone and all liability for vaccines having been removed. Meanwhile, a Canadian study has just proven that the flu vaccine containing the H1N1 vaccine which kills babies in utero, actually increases the risk of serious pandemic flu.



Americans who have been duped into submitting their children to the CDC’s deadly vaccines, have a means to respond now. People from every walk of life and every organization, must:



1. take the information from the UK FOIAs exposing 30 years of vaccine lies, the refusal of the CDC to provide any information on what it knows about those lies, and the Obama Administration’s efforts to hide the CDC’s awareness of those lies, and go to their state legislatures, demand the immediate nullification of the CDC vaccine schedule and the pandemic laws.



2. inform every vet. active duty military person, law enforcement people, DHS agents and medical personnel they know, of the vaccine hoax, for their families are deeply threatened, too, but they may not be aware of it or that they have been folded into agency structures by the pharmaceutical industry (indistinguishable from the bankers and oil companies) that would make them agents of death for their country with the declaration of a “pandemic” emergency or “bio-terrorist” attack. It is completely clear now that the terrorism/bioterrorism structures are scams so that any actions taken to “protect” this country using those laws would in fact be what threatens the existence of Americans.



It was aspirin that killed millions in 1918-19. Now it is mandated and unknown, untested vaccines with banned adjuvants in them that threaten the country with millions of deaths. At the same time, the CDC is holding 500,000 mega-coffins, built to be incinerated, on its property outside Atlanta. Not to put to fine a point on this, but it’s clear now that the CDC should not be involved in any way with public health.



Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), we know that vaccines are not a miracle of modern medicine. Any medical or government authority which insists vaccines prevent diseases is either ignorant of government documents (and endless studies) revealing the exact opposite or of the CDC’s attempts to hide the truth about vaccines from the public, or means harm to the public.



Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), we know the vaccine schedule is a hoax.

The health danger to American children and adults are vaccines.



“The greatest lie ever told is that vaccines are safe and effective.”

395,"The British health secretary Matt Hancock said during a briefing that he hopes ‘everybody would have the vaccine’, if and when a coronavirus shot is rolled out, and did not rule out making it mandatory for every citizen.

Hancock was asked directly by a reporter if getting the vaccine could be made compulsory, and replied that the question is “not one that we have addressed yet”.

“I would hope given the scale of this crisis and given the overwhelming need for us to get through this and to get the country back on its feet and the very positive impact that a vaccine would have that everybody would have the vaccine.” Hancock said.

Professor John Newton, who is overseeing Britain’s coronavirus testing, then confirmed that mandating vaccinations is on the table.

“Clearly mandation is there, it can be used in some instances.” Newton said, admitting however that “most successful vaccine programmes tend to be by consent.”

“Although some countries have adopted mandatory programmes, the most successful programmes tend to be done on the basis of consent, good information and good delivery mechanisms.” Newton said.



Hancock has previously strenuously criticised anti-vaccination campaigners. Last year he announced that the UK Government was “looking very seriously” at instituting compulsory vaccinations for state school pupils.

In the US, calls have been made to make any vaccination mandatory with the likes of the New York Times expressing concern that half of Americans would refuse to take it.

In Canada, a poll recently revealed that 60 per cent think that when a vaccine for coronavirus becomes available it should be made mandatory.

In addition, Canada’s current Chief Public Health Officer appeared in a recently resurfaced 2010 documentary in which she advocated using mandatory “tracking bracelets” for people who refuse to take a vaccine after a virus outbreak.

Many experts have suggested that a vaccine may not even be successful due to the nature of the coronavirus family and the fact that it can mutate.

In the UK, Scientists have expressed doubts over the effectiveness of a vaccine that has been rushed to human trials, after all of the monkeys used in initial testing later contracted coronavirus.

Meanwhile, greater breakthroughs have been made in anti-body studies, with researchers from Seattle successfully neutralizing the spike proteins of the virus, and researchers in California claiming to have discovered anti-bodies that can completely block COVID-19.

972,"New Jersey preschoolers have highest autism rates in the nation, researchers say

WOODLAND PARK, N.J. – New Jersey preschoolers have the highest rates of autism ever measured in the United States, a rate that has increased faster than in other states studied, researchers at Rutgers University reported Thursday. The rate of autism among children in the state has tripled in a generation.

One in 35 children in New Jersey was diagnosed with autism by their fourth birthday, according to the study published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those children were more likely to have attracted the attention of pediatricians and early-childhood educators because of moderate to severe symptoms of autism. Still, more children are diagnosed with autism when they enter public schools.

The relentless climb in autism rates – from 1% of children born in 1992 to 3% of children born in 2010 – has shown no signs of reaching a plateau, said Walter Zahorodny, an associate professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School who directed the New Jersey portion of the study.

""The explosive rate of autism is impossible to ignore,"" he said. School districts face increasing demand for educational resources for children with autism. Clinicians face long waiting lists for their services. ""There's no letup,"" he said. ""I really don't understand why the rate is going up in this way.""

Researchers can’t explain why autism rates have increased in New Jersey and elsewhere.

Contributing factors include genetic mutations and birth-related risks, such as being born prematurely, as one of a multiple birth, to a mother who was ill during pregnancy or to parents who are older than 30. But the greatest influences appear to be unknown environmental factors, Zahorodny said.

Among 4-year-olds, the rate climbed 43% in just four years, from 2010 to 2014, he said. One in 23 4-year-old boys in New Jersey is now diagnosed with autism.

""We must take swift and systematic action to increase access to and fund medically necessary treatment for every child with autism,"" said Suzanne Buchanan, executive director of Autism New Jersey. ""Early identification is crucial to helping families access services for these preschoolers, who need intensive treatment to learn developmentally appropriate skills and maximize their potential.""

The New Jersey data is included in a seven-state study by the Early Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, which has monitored rates of autism diagnoses for 19 years. Researchers in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin, as well as New Jersey, screened the health records of nearly 71,000 children. Three states used education records in addition to health records.

In all, they identified more than 1,200 children with autism. The New Jersey study included every 4-year-old in Essex and Union counties – 18,112 children in 2014 – and identified 514 with autism.

Boys in New Jersey were 3½ times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with the disorder, the data showed. Autism diagnoses among whites, blacks and Hispanic children increased at the same rate, although white children were slightly more likely to be diagnosed.

Perhaps most disturbing: The age at first diagnosis didn't budge in 15 years.

In New Jersey, it even increased by a few months – perhaps because the growing demand for services and the limited number of providers meant delays in care, Zahorodny said.

“Despite our greater awareness, we are not effective yet in early detection,” he said. “Our goal should be systematic, universal screening"" by pediatricians and other health providers at regular visits from 18 months of age onward.

Autism is a complex disorder that interferes with social interaction and communication. People with autism display a range, or spectrum, of behaviors from obsessive interest in certain subjects and repetitive speech patterns to self-injurious behavior with little or no ability to communicate. The development of a child's brain is affected early in life, and while there is no cure, early intervention can maximize a child's ability to function and participate in the community.

Across the country, rates of autism ranged from a low of eight per 1,000 children in Missouri to New Jersey's high of 28 per 1,000 children. The national average was 13 per 1,000 children, according to the study.

""The experience of our special education system and the number of developmental specialists in our region"" meant New Jersey's data was probably more complete than that of other states, Zahorodny said. States with lower rates probably had not identified all those affected, he said.",mainstream
643,"Just as COVID-19 (reportedly caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2) has dominated the news cycle in 2020, so, too, the focus on an eventual coronavirus vaccine has crowded out needed attention to a wider range of prevention and treatment strategies. Self-appointed pandemic guru Bill Gates—through a complex tangle of direct and indirect funding mechanisms that includes being the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) second largest donor—is gleefully leading the contingent promoting planet-wide coronavirus vaccination, unashamedly asserting that a vaccine “is the only thing that will allow us to return to normal.” Gates has the effrontery to make such claims despite financial conflicts of interest blatant enough to be noticed even by the credulous, and a lengthy trail of vaccine-related destruction left in the wake of Gates-funded vaccine programs around the world.

Globally, roughly 70 COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of development—a veritable gold rush that will be all the more lucrative since Gates has made sure that the vaccines will be indemnified against lawsuits. Gates funding, through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), is helping to spur the accelerated development of some of the leading contenders, including two of the three experimental vaccines rushed into Phase I trials in humans without any preliminary testing in animal models. (A third experimental vaccine will soon proceed to Phase II trials in China.) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is running the trial of one of these vaccines (mRNA-1273), co-developed under CEPI sponsorship with Cambridge-based biotech firm Moderna. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals is conducting a Phase I trial of INO-4800, a vaccine being developed with massive infusions of funding from both the Gates Foundation and CEPI.

In early April, Dr. Jerome H. Kim (Director General of the United-Nations-affiliated International Vaccine Institute) called attention to the “unprecedented speed” with which the Phase I trials launched, stating that it will be difficult to know whether a vaccine developed in a scant four, 12 or even 18 months “is really safe” and noting that the vaccine development process ordinarily takes anywhere from five to ten years. Although striving for enthusiasm about the “remarkable” speed-up, Kim warned that even when vaccine makers appropriately begin the process with animal studies, “vaccine development is characterized by a high failure rate of ‘often 93%.’”

Dr. Kim’s words of warning are far from theoretical. In the mid-to-late 2000s, scientists engaged in an ultimately futile effort to develop a vaccine to address the first SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Researchers of the day developed four SARS-CoV vaccines that underwent testing in animal models and two (described in 2007 and 2008) that proceeded to Phase I trials in humans. The less-than-reassuring results of the animal studies, in particular, prompted one set of researchers to conclude that “Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated” [emphasis added].

In 2012, Texas researchers with combined expertise in molecular virology, microbiology, immunology, biodefense and emerging diseases reported in the journal PLoS ONE on their evaluation—in mice—of four candidate vaccines designed to prevent SARS-CoV. All four vaccines had run into trouble in earlier experimental studies, which showed that the vaccines had a tendency to induce pathologic lung reactions in the unfortunate recipients—whether mice, ferrets or nonhuman primates.

The Texas scientists reevaluated the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of two whole-virus vaccines prepared in Vero tissue or Vero cell cultures (from African green monkey kidney); one recombinant (genetically engineered) DNA spike protein vaccine produced in insect cells; and their own virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine containing SARS-CoV proteins as well as mouse hepatitis coronavirus. They also compared versions of the vaccines containing an aluminum adjuvant with adjuvant-free formulations. The research team injected the experimental groups of mice with vaccine on days zero and 28, exposed them to live SARS-CoV on day 56 and sacrificed them two days later (day 58) to examine the lungs for virus and histopathology, comparing the experimental mice to control groups.

All four vaccines appeared to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV two days after exposure to live virus. However, the second set of results—the findings that persuaded the researchers to urge the utmost caution in proceeding to human testing—showed that all of the vaccinated mice, irrespective of the type of vaccine or the presence or absence of aluminum adjuvant, displayed unique lung damage not seen in the control mice, and the pathology occurred in the absence of any detectable SARS coronavirus in the lungs. The researchers described this “Th2-type immunopathology”—indicated in part by abnormal levels of white blood cells called eosinophils—as suggestive of vaccine-induced “hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components.”

To explain their findings, the Texas researchers pointed to studies showing similar immunopathologic reactions in human infants who, in the 1960s, received vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). That body of research found that the RSV vaccine “stimulated an unbalanced immune response” that “potentiated” disease in the vaccine recipients upon subsequent exposure to RSV, often leading to hospitalization and sometimes leading to death. Given that the very basis for developing a SARS vaccine was to protect vaccine recipients from infectious SARS-CoV, the Texas researchers concluded that a vaccine that instead elicited an immunopathologic reaction (as had occurred in the 1960s with the RSV vaccine) was cause for concern.

More recently, in 2016, scientists expressed similar worries when children in the Philippines developed serious complications or died after receiving a vaccine to protect against dengue disease. Far from protecting the children, the vaccine dramatically worsened risks of severe complications in children exposed to dengue after vaccination. The deaths of roughly 600 children are now under criminal investigation.

Two other worries highlighted by the Texas researchers in 2012 are worth mentioning in light of today’s COVID-19 context. First, given that there are a number of human coronaviruses, the researchers suggested that their results raised important questions about the “safety of vaccinated persons exposed to other coronaviruses.” Second, they noted that although the two Phase I clinical trials of SARS-CoV vaccines in humans had reported the vaccines to “induce antibody responses and to be ‘safe,’ . . . the evidence for safety [was] for a short period of observation.” Today, knowing that even the WHO’s top experts are questioning how vaccine safety gets evaluated, one wonders how the rushed COVID-19 vaccine trials will be able to address SARS-CoV safety concerns to any meaningful degree.

Bill Gates and his foundation have longstanding ties with the good-cop/bad-cop duo that has been headlining the official COVID-19 narrative: Dr. Anthony Fauci, long-time NIAID director, and physician and retired Army colonel Dr. Deborah Birx, U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy. It is noteworthy that the two government doctors are long-time allies, having cut their professional teeth working “side by side” on the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and sharing overlapping career paths ever since. With HIV vaccine patents to both their names, neither Birx nor Fauci is a stranger to the lure and potential profits involved in vaccine development—regardless of whether the vaccine ever pans out.

In the early 2000s, Birx was one of the lead investigators of an HIV vaccine clinical trial in Thailand. Although the trial’s methodology and results drew severe criticism, Birx and others—including Fauci—spun the study as a success. As her reward, Birx then spent the next ten years directing the CDC’s Division of Global HIV/AIDS. In 2016, Fauci and NIAID dished out more taxpayer money to test the same HIV vaccine all over again in South Africa, but NIAID had to call a halt to the study in February 2020, when an interim review found that the vaccine was worthless.

Around the same time as the Thai vaccine trial, Fauci was active as one of the “principal architects” of the 2003 President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a still-ongoing program that has since ballooned into over 50 countries, where it coordinates (across seven different U.S. departments and agencies) promotion of HIV drugs and other measures. Since 2014, PEPFAR has been led by none other than Birx, who has been only too happy to accept generous Gates Foundation support. The foundation is the top source of philanthropic funding for all international HIV efforts, and development of an HIV vaccine remains one of its core “areas of focus.” In the face of recent Trump administration threats to slash PEPFAR’s budget, Birx has declared her willingness to seek out “other sources of funding wherever she can find them.”

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), of which NIAID is a part, have been joined at the hip with the Gates Foundation for many years, together funding 57% of “global-health research and development on diseases that disproportionately affect populations in low- and middle-income countries.” The close partnership has involved working to develop new vaccines (such as a malaria vaccine and a universal influenza vaccine) as well as mobilizing Gates funding streams to roll out NIH-developed vaccines across the developing world. In 2013, Gates declared himself “thrilled” with NIH for “pushing [vaccine research] forward” and stated, “We are just at the beginning of what we can do together.”

Despite writing on March 26 in The New England Journal of Medicine that the COVID-19 case fatality rate is likely to be no worse than the rate observed for a severe seasonal flu, Dr. Fauci continues to pledge allegiance to extreme measures, parroting Mr. Gates’ statements that more prolonged lockdowns are necessary and advising Americans to become a nation of obsessive-compulsive hand-washers who never share a handshake again. On these topics , Birx has been evasive and non-committal.

Recently, Dr. Zeke Emanuel—coronavirus advisor to both Joe Biden and the WHO, and one of the former ringleaders behind Obamacare—joined the fray, urging the banning of conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services and restaurant meals for another 18 months, or “until we have a vaccine that protects everyone.” The Guardian obligingly echoed this vaccine-centric propaganda on April 8 when, reporting on a Chinese study just published in The Lancet, the British rag stated that “Lockdowns can’t end until Covid-19 vaccine found.”

Listening to these individuals’ carefully crafted public briefings on COVID-19 exit strategies, one could easily get the impression that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is, indeed, the only way out. For a population amped up on hysteria and fear, it may be challenging to accept other solutions—including the historically documented benefits of natural herd immunity—but the studies on unsafe vaccines for SARS-CoV, RSV and dengue suggest that Americans would be wise to ask the age-old question of “who benefits” and push back against the billionaires and scientists looking to limit choices, control populations and make a financial killing.

256,"The idea that vaccines cause autism received yet another blow this week, with a new article in the British Journal of Medicine declaring the 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, which originally found an autism-vaccine link, an ""elaborate fraud."" The article is the latest criticism of a theory that has been widely discredited. But if vaccines are off the table, what does cause autism?

While scientists are still investigating the issue, they say the disorder likely has a number of causes involving both our genes and our environment, or some combination of the two. For instance, people may have underlying genetic susceptibilities to autism that are triggered by something they encounter in the environment.

Making things even more complicated is the fact that autism, which is characterized by problems interacting and communicating with others, is not a single disorder, but a range of disorders that may have various causes. [See a timeline of events: Vaccines and Autism: How the Truth Unfolded]

""People are going to manifest the disorder in different ways, and that could be because there are different sets of genes, [or] different sets of environmental factors,"" that contribute to how the disorder presents itself, said Alycia Halladay, director of research for environmental sciences for Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy organization that funds autism research.

Here are the latest findings and ideas from scientists about what might really cause this mysterious condition.

There is strong evidence that changes in our genes contribute to autism.

For one thing, the disorder is highly heritable. Families that have one child with autism have a 1 in 20 chance of having a second child with autism, according to the National Institutes of Health. This is a higher risk than in the general population. And twin studies have found that if one twin has autism, the other twin as a 90 percent chance of having the disorder.

Research has also shown that the genetic changes that contribute to autism don't have to be inherited — they may also arise spontaneously.

In total, scientists have identified about 20 genes that may be involved in autism spectrum disorder, Halladay said. While these genes are located all over the human genome, they share a common theme, she said. Many have a role in brain development, brain growth and the way brain cells communicate.

For example, a recent study found that children with a genetic mutation on chromosome 17 were 14 times more likely to develop autism than those without the mutation.

Exposure to pesticides has also been linked to autism. Some studies have found that pesticides may interfere with genes involved in the central nervous system, said Dr. Alice Mao, a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

Scientists think that chemicals in pesticides may adversely affect those who are genetically predisposed to autism, leading them to develop the full-blown disorder, Mao said.

""Maybe they were born with a vulnerability to autism, but then exposure to the pesticides might have cause the presentation of autism,"" Mao told MyHealthNewsDaily.

Babies that have been exposed to certain pharmaceuticals in the womb, including valproic acid and thalidomide, have been found to have a higher risk of autism.

Thalidomide is a drug that was first used in the 1950s to treat morning sickness, anxiety and insomnia. The drug was withdrawn from the market after it was linked with birth defects, but is currently prescribed for a severe skin disorder and as a treatment for cancer.

Valproic acid is a medication prescribed for seizures, mood disorders and bipolar disorder, according to the NIH.

As parents grow older, they have a higher risk of having children with autism, Halladay said.

A study published last February found that women who are 40 years old have a 50 percent greater risk of having a child with autism than women who are between 20 and 29 years old.

Researchers aren't sure why parental age may influence autism risk, but it might be related to genetic mutations that occur in the sperm or the egg as parents grow older, Halladay said.

The development of the brain

Particular areas of the brain, including the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, have been implicated in autism, Mao said. These brain areas are thought to be responsible for concentration, movement and mood regulation.

Irregularities in the levels of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, have also been tied to autism, Mao said. Problems regulating dopamine can lead to problems with concentration and movement disabilities, while troubles controlling serotonin levels can result in mood problems.

While scientists cannot say definitively what causes autism, they have come a long way in the last decade, Halladay said.

For example, researchers originally thought there might be just a single gene or a few environmental factors that are linked to autism, but now evidence has shown there are likely to be more.

""I think our knowledge has increased, and the way that we go about looking for potential genes and environmental candidates has improved,"" Halladay said.

""We're thinking about a new model — it's not just going to be just one gene or one environmental factor, it's more complex than that,"" she said.

Pass it on: Autism likely has a number of causes, both genetic and environmental.

1313,"(Reuters) - The United States recorded 41 new measles cases last week, bringing the year’s total number of cases to 981 in the worst outbreak of the disease since 1992, federal health officials said on Monday.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease rose 4% in the week ended May 31 from the prior week. The 2019 outbreak, which has spread to 26 states, is the worst since 1992, when 2,126 cases were recorded.

Federal health officials attribute this year’s outbreak to U.S. parents who refuse to vaccinate their children. These parents believe, contrary to scientific evidence, that ingredients in the vaccine can cause autism.

The disease has mostly affected children who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which confers immunity to the disease.

On Thursday, CDC officials said the outbreak had surpassed the total number of cases per year for the past 25 years, topping the 963 cases that were confirmed in 1994.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for a year. Still, cases of the virus occur and spread via travelers coming from countries where measles is common.

CDC officials have warned that the country risks losing its measles elimination status if the ongoing outbreak, which began in October 2018 in New York, continues until October 2019.

“Measles is preventable and the way to end this outbreak is to ensure that all children and adults who can get vaccinated, do get vaccinated,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement on Thursday. “I want to reassure parents that vaccines are safe, they do not cause autism.”

The outbreak has escalated since 82 people in 2018 and more than 40 people in 2019 brought measles to the United States from other countries, most frequently Ukraine, Israel and the Philippines, federal officials said.",mainstream
833,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday rolled out a hyper-ambitious plan to develop and manufacture hundreds of millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2020, outlining an aggressive process that, if successful, would shatter conventional wisdom about the typical process for developing vaccines for emerging infectious diseases.

At a Rose Garden press conference, the president and his deputies acknowledged their goal, dubbed “Operation Warp Speed,” was lofty. Trump said the project was “risky and expensive.” Gustave Perna, a four-star general who oversees logistics for the U.S. Army, called the task “Herculean.” Moncef Slaoui, the pharmaceutical executive Trump has appointed to lead the initiative, said the goal was “extremely challenging.”

But they allowed themselves little ambiguity. Mark Esper, the defense secretary, pledged to deliver a vaccine “at scale” to the U.S. and its foreign partners by the end of the year.

The rollout highlights an overt shift in the White House’s messaging on vaccines. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease researcher, has long warned Americans that, even optimistically, developing a Covid-19 vaccine would take between 12 and 18 months. Even that timeline, Fauci has said, would represent something of a biomedical miracle.

The Trump administration’s scientific muscle, however, was notably silent. During his remarks, the president was flanked by three physician-researchers: Fauci; Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator; and Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health.

The three doctors were the only federal officials who appeared on stage wearing masks. None spoke at any point during the press conference.

Instead, it was Slaoui, the former GlaxoSmithKline executive who Trump has appointed to lead the vaccine initiative, who delivered yet another strikingly confident prediction.

“Mr. President, I have very recently seen early data from a clinical trial with a coronavirus vaccine,” he said to applause. “These data make me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020.”

Slaoui, who resigned his position on the board of the drug manufacturer Moderna to accept the government appointment, was likely referencing the company’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate, which was the first in the U.S. to enter a Phase 1 clinical trial.

According to federal financial disclosures, he still holds over 156,000 Moderna stock options, worth over $10 million at the company’s current stock price, creating a potential conflict of interest if the company’s vaccine is the first to be proven effective. Numerous progressive groups in Washington have already criticized Trump over Slaoui’s appointment.

The project will rely in part on allowing drug manufacturers to begin scaling up their manufacturing efforts prior to receiving approvals regarding a potential vaccine’s effectiveness, officials said.

Trump, separately, delivered a markedly optimistic message in terms of the vaccine’s price.

“The last thing anybody’s looking for is profit,” he said.

Nonetheless, the vaccine’s price has been a consistent topic of debate among Democratic lawmakers in Washington, some of whom have attempted to pass new laws that would include affordability requirements for any vaccine developed via taxpayer-funded research.

Trump also downplayed concerns about whether, as some public health experts have feared, the race to develop a vaccine could devolve into an international showdown that leaves foreign governments to compete to secure vaccine allotments for their populations.

He said that the U.S. would work with foreign governments to distribute a Covid-19 vaccine regardless of which companies, or which countries, are first across the finish line. The federal government, he said, has “no ego” regarding vaccine development.

“We want to get to the solution,” Trump said. “We know exactly where the other countries are, and we’ll be very happy if they are able to do it. We’ll help them with delivery, we’ll help them with it in every way we can.”

The pledge, he indicated, even applies to China, the country where Covid-19 was first identified. Trump has repeatedly expressed anger over China’s handling of the outbreak in early 2020, casting doubts on its reported death toll, blaming its government for not containing the virus within its borders, and even labeling Covid-19 the “Chinese virus.”

The new initiative is the latest sign of the federal government’s far-reaching efforts to accelerate research into coronavirus tests, treatments, and vaccines. Those initiatives, in some cases, have tested the practical boundaries of biomedical research. To date, the U.S. government has announced a “Shark Tank”-like competition to develop new Covid-19 diagnostics and a series of partnerships with drug companies on both therapeutics and vaccines.

Yet Trump also warned that his plans to reopen the U.S. economy are not contingent on the development of a vaccine.

At one point, he repeated the unscientific claim that the virus will “go away” even without a vaccine. Separately, he attempted to downplay the severity of the coronavirus, noting that despite nearly 90,000 recorded U.S. deaths to date, many Americans who contracted the virus displayed few symptoms and are likely now immune.

“We think we’re going to have a vaccine in the pretty near future,” Trump said. “If we do, we’re going to really be a big step ahead. If we don’t, we’re going to be like so many other cases where you had a problem come in. It’ll go away at some point. It’ll go away. It may flare up, and it may not flare up. We’ll have to see what happens.”",mainstream
471,"A great number of YouTube videos aimed at children contain creepy, disturbing, violent and sexual content. Some even border on child abuse. It is time to take a closer look at these videos that generate millions of views per day.

Warning: This article contains disturbing images … although they’re all taken from children’s videos.

There is no easier way to get small children to pipe down than handing them a tablet or a smartphone. Toddlers know how to launch YouTube, play videos and even navigate to other “recommended videos”. This keeps children silent and entertained for long periods of time – a luxury that busy parents greatly appreciate.

While most parents hear the children’s music playing in the background, they rarely watch the videos played by their children. When they do glimpse at the screen, they see a character such as Spiderman or Princess Elsa and assume that everything is cool. But everything is not cool. There is something terribly wrong with some children’s YouTube videos and, often, those who create them do not have the best of intentions.

A great deal of these videos contains weird, disturbing, violent and even traumatizing content. They are insidiously mixed with other children’s videos, causing them to appear as “recommended videos” by YouTube and, therefore, easily accessible to children.

I am not talking about rare, obscure videos hiding in the depths of YouTube, I am talking about channels that cumulate billions of views.

Of course, the main motivation behind these videos is profit. All it takes is a few superhero costumes and a smartphone to create videos that can potentially generate lots of revenue.

However, some of these videos are simply not right. There appears to be a motivation that goes beyond profit. Some videos trick children into watching traumatizing content, others expose them to oddly “adult” situations. Even worse, some appear to cater to adults … who like to watch children. Here are some examples of the video cancer growing on YouTube (I won’t be linking to any of these videos or channels because I don’t want to help them get more hits).

Some video channels use popular characters to trick children into watching violent and disturbing material. The BBC recently reported on some of these videos.

Many videos clearly exploit children’s visceral fear and repulsion of certain things such as blood, syringes, cutting skin, tarantulas, evil clowns attacking them, etc. Children are horrified by what they are watching yet they cannot look away because the content is engrossing.

Some videos are clearly sexual – in a creepy and perverted way.

YouTube is also quick to recommend a bunch of other similar videos.

Several YouTube channels star young children in all kinds of bizarre situations. Other than the fact that these children might be forced to appear in hundreds of videos for profit, they are also often made to enact traumatic situations. Here are screenshots from a channel named MaddaKenz Vlogs where the girls often appear to be genuinely unhappy and distressed.

Things get even weirder – to the point that I feel uncomfortable even posting screenshots on there. But this filth needs to be exposed.

Unfortunately, there are other channels that produce these kinds of videos.

Viewing these videos in order to write this article was a disturbing experience. Most of them trigger that gut feeling that something is wrong and that children’s innocence is being preyed on by twisted minds. Although there’s an absurd amount of this type of content on YouTube (this article could have been 10 times longer), I attempted to expose the various reasons why these videos are cancerous. Using underhanded and manipulative ways, these videos deliver disturbing content directly into the brains of very young children.

One wonders how these “amateur” channels can even exploit the likeness of these children’s characters without being hit with copyright infringement lawsuits. Also, many channels are clearly sponsored by major brands to produce videos that brainwash children into consuming their stuff (I recall watching a video where The Hulk eats Kinder chocolates for like 4 minutes non-stop). Obviously, there is big money and big corporations behind these cheap-looking videos.

However, the true aim of this article is not about YouTube moderation, it is about vigilance: Keep an eye on the videos watched by children. Analyze their contents. It only takes a few taps on a touchscreen for children to end up watching videos custom-made to poison their minds and shock their very core. And don’t be surprised if some of these video channels are linked to actual child abuse systems.",conspiracy
1011,"Dr. Diane Harper was the lead researcher in the development of the human papilloma virus vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix. She is the latest to come forward and question the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines.

She made the surprising announcement at the 4th International Public Conference on Vaccination, which took place in Reston, Virginia on Oct. 2nd through 4th, 2009.

Her speech was supposed to promote the Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines, but she instead turned on her corporate bosses in a very public way. When questioned about the presentation, audience members remarked that they came away feeling that the vaccines should not be used.

“I came away from the talk with the perception that the risk of adverse side effects is so much greater than the risk of cervical cancer, I couldn’t help but question why we need the vaccine at all.” – Joan Robinson

Dr. Harper explained in her presentation that the cervical cancer risk in the U.S. is already extremely low, and that vaccinations are unlikely to have any effect upon the rate of cervical cancer in the United States. In fact, 70% of all H.P.V. infections resolve themselves without treatment in a year, and the number rises to well over 90% in two years. Harper also mentioned the safety angle.

All trials of the vaccines were done on children aged 15 and above, despite them currently being marketed for 9-year-olds. So far, 15,037 girls have reported adverse side effects from Gardasil alone to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V.A.E.R.S.), and this number only reflects parents who underwent the hurdles required for reporting adverse reactions.

At the time of writing, 44 girls are officially known to have died from these vaccines.The reported side effects include Guillian Barré Syndrome (paralysis lasting for years, or permanently — sometimes eventually causing suffocation), lupus, seizures, blood clots, and brain inflammation. Parents are usually not made aware of these risks.

Dr. Harper, the vaccine developer, claimed that she was speaking out, so that she might finally be able to sleep at night.

“About eight in every ten women who have been sexually active will have H.P.V. at some stage of their life. Normally there are no symptoms, and in 98 per cent of cases it clears itself. But in those cases where it doesn’t, and isn’t treated, it can lead to pre-cancerous cells which may develop into cervical cancer.” – Dr. Diane Harper

One must understand how the establishment’s word games are played to truly understand the meaning of the above quote, and one needs to understand its unique version of “science”.

When they report that untreated cases “can” lead to something that “may” lead to cervical cancer, it really means that the relationship is merely a hypothetical conjecture that is profitable if people actually believe it. In other words, there is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent, but it is marketed to do that nonetheless.

In fact, there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer. From the manufacturers own admissions, the vaccine only works on 4 strains out of 40 for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period, so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about about the same as the chance of him being struck by a meteorite.

Why do nine-year-old girls need vaccinations for extremely rare and symptom-less venereal diseases that the immune system usually kills anyway?",conspiracy
90,"Among the myriad, earth-shattering geopolitical effects of coronavirus, one is already graphically evident. China has re-positioned itself. For the first time since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s reforms in 1978, Beijing openly regards the US as a threat, as stated a month ago by Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the Munich Security Conference during the peak of the fight against coronavirus.

Beijing is carefully, incrementally shaping the narrative that, from the beginning of the coronovirus attack, the leadership knew it was under a hybrid war attack. Xi’s terminology is a major clue. He said, on the record, that this was war. And, as a counter-attack, a “people’s war” had to be launched.

Moreover, he described the virus as a demon or devil. Xi is a Confucianist. Unlike some other ancient Chinese thinkers, Confucius was loath to discuss supernatural forces and judgment in the afterlife. However, in a Chinese cultural context, devil means “white devils” or “foreign devils”: guailo in Mandarin, gweilo in Cantonese. This was Xi delivering a powerful statement in code.

When Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, voiced in an incandescent tweet the possibility that “it might be US Army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan” – the first blast to this effect to come from a top official – Beijing was sending up a trial balloon signaliing that the gloves were finally off. Zhao Lijian made a direct connection with the Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019, which included a delegation of 300 US military.

He directly quoted US CDC director Robert Redfield who, when asked last week whether some deaths by coronavirus had been discovered posthumously in the US, replied that “some cases have actually been diagnosed this way in the US today.”

Zhao’s explosive conclusion is that Covid-19 was already in effect in the US before being identified in Wuhan – due to the by now fully documented inability of US to test and verify differences compared with the flu.

Adding all that to the fact that coronavirus genome variations in Iran and Italy were sequenced and it was revealed they do not belong to the variety that infected Wuhan, Chinese media are now openly asking questions and drawing a connection with the shutting down in August last year of the “unsafe” military bioweapon lab at Fort Detrick, the Military Games, and the Wuhan epidemic. Some of these questions had been asked – with no response – inside the US itself.

Extra questions linger about the opaque Event 201 in New York on October 18, 2019: a rehearsal for a worldwide pandemic caused by a deadly virus – which happened to be coronavirus. This magnificent coincidence happened one month before the outbreak in Wuhan.

Event 201 was sponsored by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum (WEF), the CIA, Bloomberg, John Hopkins Foundation and the UN. The World Military Games opened in Wuhan on the exact same day.

Irrespective of its origin, which is still not conclusively established, as much as Trump tweets about the “Chinese virus,” Covid-19 already poses immensely serious questions about biopolitics (where’s Foucault when we need him?) and bio-terror.

The working hypothesis of coronavirus as a very powerful but not Armageddon-provoking bio-weapon unveils it as a perfect vehicle for widespread social control – on a global scale.

Just as a fully masked Xi visiting the Wuhan frontline last week was a graphic demonstration to the whole planet that China, with immense sacrifice, is winning the “people‘s war” against Covid-19, Russia, in a Sun Tzu move on Riyadh whose end result was a much cheaper barrel of oil, helped for all practical purposes to kick-start the inevitable recovery of the Chinese economy. This is how a strategic partnership works.

The chessboard is changing at breakneck speed. Once Beijing identified coronavirus as a bio-weapon attack the “people’s war” was launched with the full force of the state. Methodically. On a “whatever it takes” basis. Now we are entering a new stage, which will be used by Beijing to substantially recalibrate the interaction with the West, and under very different frameworks when it comes to the US and the EU.

Soft power is paramount. Beijing sent an Air China flight to Italy carrying 2,300 big boxes full of masks bearing the script, “We are waves from the same sea, leaves from the same tree, flowers from the same garden.” China also sent a hefty humanitarian package to Iran, significantly aboard eight flights from Mahan Air – an airline under illegal, unilateral Trump administration sanctions.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic could not have been more explicit: “The only country that can help us is China. By now, you all understood that European solidarity does not exist. That was a fairy tale on paper.”

Under harsh sanctions and demonized since forever, Cuba is still able to perform breakthroughs – even on biotechnology. The anti-viral Heberon – or Interferon Alpha 2b – a therapeutic, not a vaccine, has been used with great success in the treatment of coronavirus. A joint venture in China is producing an inhalable version, and at least 15 nations are already interested in importing the therapeutic.

Now compare all of the above with the Trump administration offering $1 billion to poach German scientists working at biotech firm Curevac, based in Thuringia, on an experimental vaccine against Covid-19, to have it as a vaccine “only for the United States.”

Sandro Mezzadra, co-author with Brett Neilson of the seminal The Politics of Operations: Excavating Contemporary Capitalism, is already trying to conceptualize where we stand now in terms of fighting Covid-19.

We are facing a choice between a Malthusian strand – inspired by social Darwinism – “led by the Johnson-Trump-Bolsonaro axis” and, on the other side, a strand pointing to the “requalification of public health as a fundamental tool,” exemplified by China, South Korea and Italy. There are key lessons to be learned from South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.

The stark option, Mezzadra notes, is between a “natural population selection,” with thousands of dead, and “defending society” by employing “variable degrees of authoritarianism and social control.” It’s easy to imagine who stands to benefit from this social re-engineering, a 21st century remix of Poe’s The Masque of the Red Death.

Amid so much doom and gloom, count on Italy to offer us Tiepolo-style shades of light. Italy chose the Wuhan option, with immensely serious consequences for its already fragile economy. Quarantined Italians remarkably reacted by singing on their balconies: a true act of metaphysical revolt.

Not to mention the poetic justice of the actual St. Corona (“crown” in Latin) being buried in the city of Anzu since the 9th century. St. Corona was a Christian killed under Marcus Aurelius in 165 AD, and has been for centuries one of the patron saints of pandemics.

Not even trillions of dollars raining from the sky by an act of divine Fed mercy were able to cure Covid-19. G-7 “leaders” had to resort to a videoconference to realize how clueless they are – even as China’s fight against coronavirus gave the West a head start of several weeks.

Shanghai-based Dr. Zhang Wenhong, one of China’s top infectious disease experts, whose analyses have been spot on so far, now says China has emerged from the darkest days in the “people’s war” against Covid-19. But he does not think this will be over by summer. Now extrapolate what he’s saying to the Western world.

It’s not even spring yet, and we already know it takes a virus to mercilessly shatter the Goddess of the Market. Last Friday, Goldman Sachs told no fewer than 1,500 corporations that there was no systemic risk. That was false.

New York banking sources told me the truth: systemic risk became way more severe in 2020 than in 1979, 1987 or 2008 because of the hugely heightened danger that the $1.5 quadrillion derivative market would collapse.

As the sources put it, history had never before seen anything like the Fed’s intervention via its little understood elimination of commercial bank reserve requirements, unleashing a potential unlimited expansion of credit to prevent a derivative implosion stemming from a total commodity and stock market collapse of all stocks around the world.

Those bankers thought it would work, but as we know by now all the sound and fury signified nothing. The ghost of a derivative implosion – in this case not caused by the previous possibility, the shutting down of the Strait of Hormuz – remains.

We are still barely starting to understand the consequences of Covid-19 for the future of neoliberal turbo-capitalism. What’s certain is that the whole global economy has been hit by an insidious, literally invisible circuit breaker. This may be just a “coincidence.” Or this may be, as some are boldly arguing, part of a possible, massive psy-op creating the perfect geopolitlcal and social engineering environment for full-spectrum dominance.

Additionally, along the hard slog down the road, with immense, inbuilt human and economic sacrifice, with or without a reboot of the world-system, a more pressing question remains: will imperial elites still choose to keep waging full-spectrum-dominance hybrid war against China?

1169,"Establishment Republican and neocon anti-Trumper Rick Wilson calls for “anti-vaxxers” to be placed into re-education camps

In response to a vaccine industry propaganda piece recently published by NBC News, Rick Wilson, a Trump-hating member of the establishment Republican party, tweeted about how parents who oppose vaccination for their children should be sent to re-education camps.

A throwback to Nazi Germany, Wilson declared “anti-vaxxers” a “scourge” on society, and demanded that all their property be immediately seized and their children taken into “protective custody” – all for questioning the safety and effectiveness of a “medicine” that’s never been tested against a true placebo.

Wilson was apparently upset to read that some New Yorkers and Californians have decided to picket in front of doctors’ officers where medical staff insist upon forcing all patients to be vaccinated, even against their will. So, he chose to respond by calling for such individuals to be taken to the gulag like Adolph Hitler would have done.

“Anti-vaxxers are a scourge and a strong argument for re-education camps, the immediate seizure of their property, and putting their children into protective custody,” were Wilson’s exact words on Twitter, which earned him 7,834 likes as of this writing.

At least one Twitter user responded to Wilson’s rant by pointing out the vaccine for polio is actually spreading more polio, while another shared a link to an article in The Guardian about how parents in Pakistan are actually going to jail for taking a stand against mandatory polio vaccination.

“The parents in Pakistan will sacrifice anything to stop it!” this same user wrote in a caption to the linked article.

Others expressed disgust that Wilson so glibly ignores the plight of vaccine-injured children, which number in the thousands, if not tens of thousands. Still others called out Wilson, a supposed journalist, for engaging in “irresponsible journalism.”

“The start lesson to be learned is that medicine can be weaponized when doctors join forces with government & deviate from their personal and professional ethical commitment under the Hippocratic Oath – ‘First, do no harm!'” tweeted yet another.

Americans have every right to protest forced “medicine” that could harm or kill their children

While the audacity of some parents standing up to the medical police state has really thrown Wilson into a tizzy, his followers were generally opposed to his gulag sentiment. Somehow, they don’t see it as fitting to throw people into concentration camps simply because they choose not to vaccinate.

When, exactly, did vaccination become the type of thing that has to be mandated at gunpoint? What happened to freedom of health choice, or the Constitution, for that matter?

If vaccines really work as claimed, then it shouldn’t matter if some people choose not to get them. Those who did get them have the protection they need, right? Common sense further dictates that if vaccines really work without ever causing a single harmful side effect, then nobody would be opposed to them in the first place.

But this is simply not the case, as thousands of parents have been left with injured or dead kids as a result of vaccination. While they may work for some, vaccines certainly don’t work for all – which means mandating them, as states like California and New York are now trying to do, constitutes crimes against humanity.

“One could make the argument that anti-vaxxers are pushing harmful misinformation, but to suggest they should have their kids seized and put in gulags is clearly demented,” writes Paul Joseph Watson for Infowars.

“While Wilson purports to be a conservative, he is in reality a deep state neo-con who has trashed President Trump for [three] years solid.”",conspiracy

Earlier this month, the United Nations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, and others said it was a “moral imperative” that everyone have access to a “people’s vaccine.” But such grand declarations are unenforceable, and without a detailed strategy, the allocation of vaccines could be inequitable and extremely messy, said health experts.

“We have this beautiful picture of everyone getting the vaccine, but there is no road map on how to do it,” said Yuan Qiong Hu, a senior legal and policy advisor at Doctors Without Borders in Geneva. Few measures have been taken to resolve numerous problems for achieving fair distribution, she said.

In the past, Hu said, companies have often applied for patents for nearly every step of a vaccine’s development and production, from the biological material used to the preservative needed to stretch vaccine doses to even how the shots are administered.

“We can’t afford to face these multiple layers of private rights to create a ‘people’s vaccine,’” she said.

Speaking at a vaccine summit earlier this month that addressed the thorny issue of equitable distribution, Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo agreed.

“Only a people’s vaccine with equality and solidarity at its core can protect all of humanity from the virus,” he said.

At a summit with African leaders on Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said countries in Africa would be “among the first to benefit” once a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and deployed in China, but no deals were announced to back up his promise.

Worldwide, about a dozen potential COVID-19 vaccines are in early stages of testing. While some could move into late-stage testing later this year if all goes well, it’s unlikely any would be licensed before early next year at the earliest. Still, numerous rich countries have already ordered some of these experimental shots and expect delivery even before they are granted marketing approval.

Britain and the U.S. have spent millions of dollars on various vaccine candidates, including one being developed by Oxford University and manufactured by AstraZeneca. In return, both countries are expected to get priority treatment; the British government declared that if the vaccine proves effective, the first 30 million doses would be earmarked for Britons.

Separately AstraZeneca signed an agreement to make at least 300 million doses available for the U.S., with the first batches delivered as early as October. In a briefing Tuesday, senior Trump administration officials said there will be a tiered system to determine who in America is offered the first vaccine doses. Tiers likely would include groups most at risk of severe disease and workers performing essential services.

Last week, the European Union moved to ensure its own supply. On Saturday, AstraZeneca struck a deal with a vaccines group forged by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands to secure 400 million doses by the end of the year.

Among several global efforts underway to try to ensure developing countries don’t get left behind is an “advance market commitment” from the vaccines alliance GAVI, whose chief executive has warned countries about the dangers of vaccines not being available globally.

“Even if a few countries go ahead and have vaccines, if there are raging outbreaks in other places ... that is going to continue to threaten the world and the return to normality,” said Seth Berkley, the GAVI chief executive.

GAVI and partners have inked a $750-million deal with AstraZeneca to supply 400 million doses by the end of 2020. The Anglo-Swedish pharma giant has also agreed to license its vaccine to India’s Serum Institute for the production of 1 billion doses.

Johnson & Johnson plans to make its coronavirus shot for poor countries at a not-for-profit price, because of the complexity of the technology and expertise needed, said the company’s chief scientific officer, Dr. Paul Stoffels. Likewise, AstraZeneca has pledged to make the vaccine available at no profit during the pandemic.

The World Health Organization and others have called for a COVID-19 “patents pool,” where intellectual property rights would be surrendered so pharmaceuticals could freely share data and technical knowledge. Numerous countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada and Germany, have already begun revising their licensing laws to allow them to suspend intellectual property rights if authorities decide there is an overwhelming need given the pandemic.

But the response from the industry has been lukewarm.

Executives at Pfizer and some other major drug makers say they oppose suspending patent rights for potential COVID-19 vaccines.

Health officials worry what that might mean for divvying up supplies of a vaccine arguably needed by every country on the planet.

“We can’t just rely on goodwill to ensure access,” said Arzoo Ahmed, of Britain’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics, noting that precedents of how innovative drugs have been distributed are not encouraging. “With HIV/AIDS, it took 10 years for the drugs to reach people in lower-income countries.”

African nations have already been at the back of the line for medical supplies in the pandemic and “it will be worse if a vaccine is found,” UNAIDS chief Winnie Byanyima told reporters Thursday. “We can’t afford to be in the back of the queue.”

Other experts pointed out that there are billions of taxpayer dollars devoted to every stage of vaccine development, but little oversight over how the funds are spent and few guarantees the inoculations will get to those who need them most.

“We don’t know what the process will look like or how transparent it will be,” said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute Geneva.

The World Health Organization is currently working on developing an “allocation framework” for how coronavirus vaccines should be given out, said Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, the U.N. health agency’s chief scientist. But this guidance would not be binding.

Swaminathan said she hoped there might be 2 billion doses available for vulnerable and priority health workers globally by the end of next year and that WHO would propose how they might be distributed.

“Countries need to agree and come to a consensus,” she said. “That’s the only way this can work.”",mainstream
214,"Last week, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it would donate USD 10 million to help fund an Australian trial testing whether an old vaccine – BCG – could be used against a new threat, COVID-19. The BCG vaccine has been used for nearly a century to protect against tuberculosis. According to some recent studies, there is a clear correlation between the use of the BCG vaccine and COVID-19 infections and the course of the disease. Many believe that mandatory BCG vaccination has enabled some countries to stop the epidemic from breaking loose on a considerable scale. In countries where compulsory BCG vaccination has been suspended (e.g. Spain and France), or where it has never been introduced at all (e.g. Italy), the mortality rate from viral infection seems to be much higher. If the BCG vaccine can provide non-specific protection to bridge the gap before a disease-specific vaccine is developed, it could serve as an important tool in the response to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Is the Commission financing this research? Are there any studies researching the BCG vaccine that are financed through the EU budget?",mainstream
919,"When you buy Microsoft products, you are now promoting the pharmaceutical industry and its global vaccine agenda. That’s the new reality in which we live, where the world’s largest software company is “in bed” with the world’s largest vaccine pusher.

How so? In 2009, Microsoft purchased a key piece of technology from the drug company Merck, the world’s largest maker of vaccines (which Bill Gates says can help “reduce the global population” by 10 to 15 percent). That technology, as you’ll see below, can conceivably be used to develop eugenics vaccines that target specific races and nationalities with infertility-inducing pharmaceuticals — something that is entirely consistent with Bill Gates’ openly-admitted goal of reducing world population through the use of vaccines (see link to video below).

This gene-targeting vaccine research technology purchased by Microsoft was developed by the company known as Rosetta Biosciences, formerly owned by Merck. Their software is described as a way to “figure out how genes interact with each other, analyze peptides and metabolites, and determine how they relate to gene expression.” (seattletimes.nwsource.com)

An announcement on the Rosetta Biosoftware web site explains, “The deal allows Microsoft to incorporate genetic, genomic, metabolomic and proteomics data management software into the Microsoft Amalga Life Sciences platform for enhanced translational research capabilities.”

This same announcement goes on to say that vaccine maker Merck will “provide strategic input to Microsoft” as a part of the deal. Merck’s strategy, of course, is to make money by pimping vaccines and pharmaceuticals, including the now-infamous Gardasil vaccine.

Rupert Vessey, the vice president of Merck Research Laboratories, openly admits this deal puts Microsoft in the role of being a drug developer. He says, “We look forward to collaborating with Microsoft to develop new bioinformatic solutions to enable and expedite drug discovery and development…”

This is a key statement to understand, because the term “bioinformatic” can only mean one thing. What stores information in biology? These is only one digital storage system in human biology, and that system is, of course, DNA. Therefore, the idea of developing “bioinformatic solutions” really means to develop “gene-targeting drugs and vaccines.”

This is fully consistent with Bill Gates’ admitted agenda of reducing world population with the help of drug company technologies. At a TED conference, he announced in front of a live audience:“…if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower [global population] by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.”

All this comes on the heels of other recent news that Bill Gates is funding sperm-destroying technology to cause widespread male infertility. His foundation has also funded genetically modified mosquitoes and other mad science experiments.

Microsoft the new leader in eugenics technology?

What’s clear from all this is that Bill Gates is pursuing an agenda of human depopulation. This is a similar agenda of those who pursue eugenics efforts around the globe, including Adolf Hitler and a long list of former FDA Commissioners in the United States. One of the most common ambitions of those in the highest positions of power, it seems, is to cull the human population and eliminate “the little people,” leaving only a “master race” of supreme beings.

Even major universities around the globe are now teaching students that human beings are evil for merely being alive and exhaling carbon dioxide, and that killing off humans is “green” for the planet.

In order to kill off large swaths of human beings, the most efficient mechanism to use is a self-replicating, gene-targeted bio-weapon. Microsoft’s Amalga Life Sciences technology, purchased from vaccine developer March, theoretically provides a viable platform to develop precisely such bio-weapons. It is interesting that no announcements from the company appear to have been made since being acquired by Microsoft in 2009, indicating that their work is now being conducted in total secrecy, behind closed doors.

Recent headlines reveal that the United States government has also secretly funded bioweapons research that resulted in the development of super-deadly flu strains that could wipe out far more than just 15 percent of the human population. As revealed in recent news headlines:

“Scientists agreed Friday to a 60-day moratorium on research into a modified avian flu virus that has been demonstrated to be more transmissible among mammals. Although the investigators believe their research has a public health benefit, they acknowledge the fear of some governments and others that the genetically altered virus could escape from labs and infect people.”

That may be precisely the point, it turns out. There is no better way to promote the vaccine profits of the pharmaceutical industry than to actually release an engineered bioweapon virus into the wild. And there is no faster way to reduce the world population than to engineer either a vaccine or a weaponized flu virus that burns through the human population, targeting those of an “undesirable” genetic profile who need to be “cleansed” from the human gene pool.

This about this the next time you think about purchasing Microsoft Office, Windows or some other Microsoft product. By doing so, you are funding what could very well be a global eugenics agenda with the ultimate goal of wiping out a significant proportion of the human race.",conspiracy
987,"Donald Trump, who hawks wondrous COVID-19 elixirs from the White House lectern as if he were a nineteenth-century patent-medicine salesman, knows nothing about pandemic planning, vaccine development, antiviral drugs, or how to design the diagnostic tools required to track an epidemic such as the one that has devastated the nation he leads.

Rick A. Bright, perhaps more than any other federal health official in the United States, has devoted his career to studying those very issues: first, at the Centers for Disease Control, where for a decade he evaluated the comparative merits of antiviral drugs, and then as the scientific director of the Influenza Vaccine Project at PATH, an international, nonprofit global health organization based in Seattle. Since 2010, Bright has worked for the federal government at BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. He began as the director of the agency’s Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division, and, since 2016, he has been the head of the agency itself.

This week, Bright was abruptly fired from his job because he insisted that the federal government rely on science when making scientific decisions. Bright said in a statement yesterday that he was fired, in particular, because he insisted that hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug Trump has repeatedly touted as a “miracle cure” for COVID-19, be tested rigorously.

In an era when the President of the United States withdrew all American funding for the World Health Organization in the middle of a global pandemic, Bright’s adherence to the primacy of data doomed him. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, has also consistently failed to echo Trump’s enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine. At a daily White House briefing, on April 5th, as Trump continued to put forth the notion, without any basis in fact, that this drug could conquer the virus, a reporter asked Fauci, who is the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert, to comment. Trump refused to let him speak.

Fauci, though, is the public face of the epidemic-response team and immensely popular. To fire him, simply because he tells the truth, carries a political risk that Trump is apparently unwilling to take—for now.

Bright, a deeply reserved man who is not known to the public, was easier to toss aside. At Wednesday night’s briefing, Trump ridiculed a reporter who suggested that Bright was gifted and highly qualified. “Why did you say that he has great gifts or gifts?” Trump asked. “What, do you know him?” Bright, for his part, has made it clear that he has no intention of shuffling off to some lesser job at the National Institutes of Health without a fight. In his statement yesterday, he accused the Trump Administration of putting “politics and cronyism ahead of science.” He elaborated that, “specifically, and contrary to misguided directives, I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, promoted by the Administration as a panacea, which clearly lack scientific merit.” Bright also said that he has engaged two attorneys to represent him in a whistle-blower case against the government. He said that he resisted “efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.’’

Bright’s colleagues in the field were astonished at his sudden removal. Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunization program for the Sabin Vaccine Institute, spent fifteen years as the director of the National Vaccine Program Office, a position in which he worked often with Bright. Gellin told me, “Rick was able to advance our national pandemic preparedness for drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines,” adding, “He knows the science and embraces cutting-edge technology like few others.’’ Margaret A. Hamburg, who was the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under President Barack Obama, also worked closely with Bright. “This is hard to understand,’’ she said. “Rick is exactly the person you want to have at the table when planning new programs, especially in the midst of a pandemic.’’

I have known Bright for years. He is measured, technical, and scientific in his approach to problems. For that reason, I found his statement startling. It is a good thing that Bright spoke out. This week, preliminary data from a large study showed that coronavirus patients given hydroxychloroquine were no less likely to need mechanical ventilation and had higher death rates than those who were not. The study, which reviewed veterans’ medical charts, was posted Tuesday on MedRxiv, a preprint server, meaning that it was not peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia. (Such a study is not conclusive; it is too soon to know the ultimate results. But no responsible physician would read it and say, Hey, let’s get this drug out to millions of people right away.)

Late last year, at a panel discussion on the future of influenza pandemics, Bright explained his fundamental concerns: the country was not investing enough in creating vaccines that could potentially limit the impact of the annual flu season as well as potential pandemics. “We can make better vaccines and make them faster,” he said. “But three hundred and fifty-one billion dollars every year is our economic cost for seasonal influenza, and a pandemic goes into the trillions of dollars. We have to take that sense of urgency and economic assets to explain this disruption and the lives lost.” It had been a continual frustration to Bright—as well as to Fauci and many others—that political leaders don’t seem to learn this lesson.

We are entering a dangerous new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rick Bright’s vision has never been needed more. Even now, the President refuses to acknowledge the severity of the pandemic or how far we are from being able to safely “open” the country. That is a depressing reality, and we will need leaders to help explain and guide us to a safer and healthier future. Rick Bright has always been one of those leaders. Bright said in his statement, “Sidelining me in the middle of this pandemic and placing politics and cronyism ahead of science puts lives at risk and stunts national efforts to safely and effectively address this urgent public-health crisis.” Every one of those words is true. Unfortunately, it is no longer clear that we live in a country where expertise matters.

652,"Mercury from vaccines seems to disappear rapidly from the blood, returning to pre-vaccination levels in one month, according to a small study of children in Argentina.

The findings bolster the argument that a mercury-based vaccine preservative doesn't cause autism in children, although it's unclear from the study whether some mercury may linger elsewhere in the body.

The research addresses an unanswered question about the safety of thimerosal, a preservative that has been eliminated from routine U.S. vaccines, and breaks down as ethyl mercury in the body. It is still used in other countries, including Argentina.

Scientists assumed the health risks from ethyl mercury were similar to methyl mercury from eating fish. And in 1999, the federal government and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines to lower exposure to mercury from all sources. The decision was based on what was known about methyl mercury exposure.

The new findings suggest that methyl mercury and ethyl mercury are very different and that the removal of thimerosal from vaccines may have been over-cautious.

""The study supports the decision by the World Health Organization to continue to permit thimerosal to remain in vaccines for the world's children,"" said study co-author Dr. Michael Pichichero of the University of Rochester in Rochester, N.Y. He said thimerosal vaccines are cheaper to produce and therefore more accessible to much of the world.

In the U.S.-funded study, blood samples were taken from 216 healthy babies before and after they got vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal. Blood levels of mercury were highest shortly after the babies were vaccinated and fell to pre-vaccination levels within a few weeks.

""The amount found in the blood was about one-tenth of that predicted in that the late 1990s and the length of time it stays in the blood is one-tenth of that predicted,"" Pichichero said.

Mercury levels also were measured in the babies' stools and urine. In the stool samples, the levels were highest after vaccination and also fell, but more slowly than blood levels. There was no significant amount of mercury in the urine.

The authors could not determine what happened to all the mercury after it left the blood. All the infants gave samples twice: before vaccination and at one other time, ranging from 12 hours later to 30 days.

The study will be published in the February issue of the journal Pediatrics. The medical journal released the findings early because of a controversy surrounding a new TV series premiering Thursday, which features a lawyer who argues in court that a flu vaccine made a child autistic.

The journal is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which on Monday called on ABC to cancel the first episode of the series, ""Eli Stone,"" saying that it perpetuates the myth that vaccines can cause autism.

Autism is a complex disorder featuring repetitive behaviors and poor social interaction and communication skills. Scientists generally believe that genetics plays a role in causing the disorder; a theory that thimerosal is to blame has been repeatedly discounted in scientific studies.

Pichichero said he has received research grants and served as a consultant to several vaccine makers, but said there was no industry involvement in the new study. He is an unpaid consultant to the WHO on vaccines.",mainstream
1290,"Sean Penn’s CORE praises Los Angeles’ guardian angels — those on the ground administering COVID-19 tests — in a new PSA that reiterates that “testing saves lives.”

On March 30th, CORE (Community Organized Relief Effort) opened its first coronavirus testing site in Los Angeles; since that time, CORE now oversees 15 sites, including 12 in California, two in Atlanta and a mobile site in Detroit. Their team of 120 staff members and 300 volunteers have thus far administered 70,000 tests as of May 6th.

The “Guardians” PSA — narrated by actor Edward James Olmos — features a visual tapestry of near-desolate Los Angeles, “the City of Angels,” where only essential workers and CORE volunteers remain on the streets.

“Angels come in many ways. You might not recognize their faces, don’t know who they are,” Olmos says in the PSA over footage of the testers at work. “From downtown to LAX, from South Central to PCH, watching over us. Protecting us. Let them know that we see them.”

“CORE’s role is twofold” First, to have direct impact on the health of each and every individual we can reach. But secondly, it is our singular role in modeling government/civilian NGO partnerships that, in replication can test all Americans and re-test all Americans as long as science and medicine demands to develop a vaccine,” Penn tells Rolling Stone.

“The importance of testing begins with identifying those who may transmit the virus. Hospitalization is not necessarily required for those who test positive. Until, or unless those positive begin to experience respiratory issues, they may convalesce at home, but they must immediately isolate. The other contribution we make when we submit to being tested is a contribution to the national surveillance piece,” Penn added. “We are ALL responsible to fight this virus. Give us robust defense production, then, our great country of Republicans, Democrats, Asians, blacks, whites, browns, men, women WILL do our part. This is a moment where our president can establish a glorious legacy. It’s got to be NOW.”

The “Guardians” PSA was directed by Samuel Bayer, who helmed Nirvana’s iconic “Smells Like Teen Spirit” video. “I’ve known Sean for a number of years. When the pandemic hit, I knew his organization CORE would be fighting the good fight,” Bayer tells Rolling Stone. “I called him up and asked if I could contribute something.”

“I saw firsthand all the brave, selfless and vital work the CORE volunteers were doing during a very difficult time,” he added. “I thought maybe if I could document the anguish that Los Angeles is feeling right now and the hope that I saw at those testing facilities, maybe a film could touch people and make a difference.”

Asked what his vision was for the PSA, Bayer replies, “I wanted to create something real and honest. A snapshot, a small piece of the story. It sure isn’t about me, there’s nothing heroic in making a film about this pandemic. I saw real heroes. That’s the story I tried to tell.”

“Sam Bayer so beautifully captures our most essential message,” Penn says. “The hope to disarm this beast is volunteerism. I am a full tilt believer in a policy of mandatory service, but when I see CORE’s volunteers serving… that one makes me weep.”

These vaccines are free (practices may charge a small fee to administer tetanus and diphtheria vaccine). Talk to your doctor or practice nurse to find out how to protect yourself.

As you get older, the protection you received from some of your earlier immunisations begins to wear off. Your immune system may no longer work as well and you are at increased risk from some infectious diseases. Free immunisation is offered at age 65 onwards to protect you against some serious diseases.

Shingles is a painful rash affecting a particular nerve. It is a long term effect of chickenpox many years after people recover from the disease. Shingles usually occurs in older people and lasts from 10 to 15 days. The nerve pain can last long after the rash disappears.

Shingles vaccine is free at age 65. Until 31 December 2020, anyone aged 66 to 80 inclusive is also eligible for a free shingles vaccine.

Influenza (or the flu) is a serious illness that can be fatal. Influenza may lead to a stay in hospital at any age but particularly if you are older or have an underlying medical condition. Influenza kills around 400 New Zealanders every year.

Influenza vaccine is free and recommended every year from age 65 onwards. The vaccine is changed each year to make sure it protects against the most common strains of the virus. You can get the vaccine free at your doctors and some pharmacies from late autumn each year.

Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection of the throat, which can close off the airway. It can also affect the heart and nervous system and cause death. Because of immunisation, diphtheria is now extremely rare in New Zealand, however it can still be brought back into the country through travel.

Tetanus (or lockjaw) is a serious infection caused by bacteria that live in dirt and dust, and enter the body through a cut or wound. Tetanus causes muscle stiffness, painful spasms and sometimes death.

Combined tetanus and diphtheria (TD) vaccine is recommended at ages 45 and 65 to boost the immunity you received as a child. The vaccine is free, but your general practice will charge a small fee to give the injection.

485,"About 120,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, and daily counts of new cases in the U.S. are the highest they’ve been in more than a month, driven by recent increases in the South and Southwest.

The alarming trend has spurred talk of a “second wave” of coronavirus infections in the U.S. But health experts agree that “second wave” is probably the wrong term to describe what’s happening.

“When you have 20,000-plus infections per day, how can you talk about a second wave?” said Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “We’re in the first wave. Let’s get out of the first wave before you have a second wave.”

Clearly there was an initial infection peak in April as cases exploded in New York City. After schools and businesses were closed across the country, the rate of new cases dropped somewhat.

But “it’s more of a plateau, or a mesa,” not the trough after a wave, said Caitlin Rivers, a disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security.

Scientists generally agree the nation is still in its first wave of coronavirus infections, albeit one that’s dipping in some parts of the country while rising in others.

“This virus is spreading around the United States and hitting different places with different intensity at different times,” said Dr. Richard Besser, chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who was acting director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when the H1N1 flu pandemic hit the U.S. in 2009.

Dr. Arnold Monto, a flu expert at the University of Michigan, echoed that sentiment.

“What I would call this is continued transmission with flare-ups,” he said.

Flu seasons sometimes feature a second wave of infections. But in those cases, the second wave is a distinct new surge in cases from a strain of flu that is different than the strain that caused earlier illnesses.

That’s not the case in the coronavirus epidemic.

Monto doesn’t think “second wave” really describes what’s happening now, calling it “totally semantics.”

“Second waves are basically in the eye of the beholder,” he said.

But Besser said semantics matter, because implying that a first wave has passed may give people a false sense that the worst is over.

Some worry a large wave of coronavirus might occur this fall or winter — after schools reopen, the weather turns colder and less humid, and people huddle inside more. That would follow seasonal patterns seen with flu and other respiratory viruses. And such a fall wave could be very bad, given that there’s no vaccine and most Americans still won’t have any immunity to the virus.

But the new coronavirus so far has been spreading more episodically and sporadically than flu, and it may not follow the same playbook.

“It’s very difficult to make a prediction,” Rivers said. “We don’t know the degree to which this virus is seasonal, if at all.”",mainstream

629,"The BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) tuberculosis vaccine boosts the production of immune cells, which may explain why it can protect newborn babies from dying of sepsis.

Previous studies have shown that BCG vaccination can protect newborns against a broad range of infections beyond tuberculosis, reducing overall deaths from sepsis. But exactly how this works was unclear.

“Knowing the mechanism behind this effect will support the use of the BCG vaccine to prevent newborn sepsis,” says Nelly Amenyogbe at the Telethon Kids Institute in Perth, Australia. Amenyogbe and her colleagues analysed blood samples from 85 newborn babies in Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Papua New Guinea, half of whom had been vaccinated.

They found that, three days later, the newborns who had been vaccinated had about twice as many immune cells, called neutrophils, in their blood.

In another experiment, the researchers vaccinated newborn mice with BCG and then infected them with bacteria to induce sepsis. They also infected non-vaccinated mice. Just like the human babies, the mice that had been vaccinated produced about double the number of neutrophils, which then protected them from dying by gobbling up the bacteria that cause sepsis.

“There is increasingly strong evidence that BCG, a vaccine designed to work against tuberculosis, has advantageous non-specific effects against a range of pathogens in humans,” says Danika Hill at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, UK.

With this in mind, the BCG vaccine is currently being trialled in people as potential protection against covid-19. But “whether BCG, and any potential effect on neutrophils, could be beneficial against [the coronavirus] is unclear and warrants careful consideration”, says Hill.

Amenyogbe says BCG also has effects on other parts of the immune system, beyond neutrophils, and it is possible that these other effects may provide some benefit against covid-19.

“If vaccines such as BCG are able to provide non-specific protection against newly emerging pathogens, this could be a game changer for managing covid-19 and any future pandemics,” says Hill.

Needless to say that many serious adverse effects show up long after that time span; by definition they could never be mentioned in those studies. Nevertheless most of these studies pretend to prove the safety of the vaccine.""--Kris Gaublomme MD

621,"An AIM patriot sent us a note with a video. We are posting a public reply as many of you have asked about this video which has been shown in full, and in part, around the internet. Our community member writes:

Below is a FYI of a video, reportedly from June 17, 2010, which might be of interest if you have not come across it in the past.

The minutes below are drawn from minutes 4:00 to 16:30…some of the Pilgrim Society plans exposed from a 56 minute video created almost ten years ago.

05:00 In 2010, a retired military whistle blower, outlines a June, 2005 City of London banksters’ meeting he attended. There with some Masons, he served no more purpose than a fly-on-the-wall. At this unusual meeting alarm bells began to fire off in his head upon realizing what the group was talking about.

06:00 This whistle-blower (statement is supported by video and transcript) that there were about thirty senior masons in the meeting room including senior politicians, the chief of police was there; representatives of the church and military were there; 25 or 30 people in the room.

05:56 What they were talking about was a plan created years earlier. This meeting was to update attendees on it status. A report was being given where first they expressed concern the Israeli -Iran war was not following the schedule they had set.

08:00 In this Pilgrim Society meeting they expressed their concerns with China growing as a treat, both military and financially and that Japan was a disappointment in not, as planned, impeding their China’s progress on the global stage.

08:40 Other things discussed were the coming financial crash and the initiation of global centralization of all resources in 2008 was examined in this 2010 session.

10:20 Though the timeline is falling behind, this group is committed to initiating the following:

Israeli launched a war against Iran. Iran will be set up as the bad guys. That is the opening move in a big chess game. Iran has secretly been already provide nuclear weapons by China.

11:25 This cabal actually want this weapons to be used in the Middle East. They want Iran or China to retaliate with a nuclear weapon.

11:45 At the point there will be a “limited” nuclear exchange followed by a cease-fire. This ex-military whistle-blower heard this all being laid out in this meeting like a script to a movie.

12:05 The other thing being set up in many of the western countries for marshal law and people control…ability to arrest, detain…etc. The group wants humanity to demand heavy control on travel and communication due to fears arising from limited nuclear war. This is only the beginning.

15:00 The next thing that happens in this chess game of manipulation of the public is that bio-weapons are released on China. He heard this openly discussed in this meeting. They will release a flu like virus which will be modified genetically to specifically attack the Chinese people. It is designed to spread like wildfire to knock out a large portion of the Chinese people.

And these people in this meeting were laughing about this. They said “China will catch a cold”.

They laughed again about these bio-weapons wreaking havoc across China.

15:50 After that then a plague will sweep across the Western nations…though the whistle blower was not certain if this was due to Chinese retaliation or a mutation of the virus.

So after limited nuclear war, and a bio-weapon release, a pandemic arises around the globe and you have a totalitarian lockdown all around the world because everyone is going to be in a panic about all this.

16:30 …and then the real war starts….the Third World War…

I will be listening to the rest to see where it goes from here.

Betsy replies: I listened to this the other day. Didn’t bother to post, as in my opinion, it is propaganda b.s.. It’s a video distraction to keep the heat off the research AIM and AFI are posting – which are naming names, showing locations on maps, revealing patents and showing you the Queen’s controlling share of QinetiQ. Folks around the world are waking up to see the evil intentions of the Pilgrims Society, Privy Council, and the British Imperial Empire.

In this piece of British propaganda, the speaker says things that are generally true…but offers no concrete evidence or documentation. He’s just telling you a nice story, and, frankly, he takes forever to tell you. It’s called WORD SALAD when they talk and talk…filling space up with words, but never getting to the point.

If you listen, you will hear lots of speculation and conjecture with the mystery man at the mystery meeting. The speaker drops buzz words like “Pilgrims Society” “martial law” “CityofLondon” so you think he is really giving you “the scoop.”

In order to buy his story you first have to believe in the mystery man – which I don’t… so the rest is hearsay, at best..

One of our AIM patriots asked that we offer a prayer to help us get through the storm. Without hesitation, we offer one of our Steiner favorites:

We must eradicate from the soul

All fear and terror of what comes towards man out of the future.

In all feelings and sensations about the future.

We must look forward with absolute equanimity

To everything that may come.

And we must think only that whatever comes

Is given to us by a world-directive full of wisdom.

It is part of what we must learn in this age,

namely, to live out of pure trust,

Without any security in existence.

Trust in the ever present help

Truly, nothing else will do

If our courage is not to fail us.

And let us seek the awakening from within ourselves

83,"In this episode of Futuris the team examine what Europe is doing to boost funding for research and innovation in the fight against COVID-19.

At the University of Copenhagen researchers are working on a candidate vaccine with what is known as ""recombinant technology"". It involves cloning Coronavirus genes to identify and isolate proteins in order to understand how they bind to human cell receptors.

""The idea is to generate antibodies that hinder the virus penetrating into human cells. Right now we are testing prototype vaccines in mice. Those serums will be sent to Holland, where we will test the antibodies. The timelines are very aggressive in this project,"" says Morten Acertoug Nielsen, Associate Professor of Immunology and Microbiology, at the University of Copenhagen.

The European funded project is just one of many currently underway in Europe in the fight against the coronavirus.

Working closely with the World Health Organization, the European Union has been coordinating a so-called pledging conference to tackle the pandemic.

Focused on improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention, the conference aims to make sure that any new medical technology, developed both during and after the pandemic, is made available to all.

During the pledging Conference, the European Commission announced one billion euros for research into COVID-19 through its flagship Horizon 2020 programme. The extra funding includes 450 million euros for treatment, diagnostics and prevention; 400 million euros for R&D and production facilities and an additional 150 million euros for further innovation. In addition to enabling a greater understanding of the virus, so as to prepare and respond better to outbreaks, the money will also go towards treatment and vaccines.

""We have 48 projects which are up and running, on testing, preventing, treating, which allow 159 teams in Europe, in fact, to come together. Part of the effort is also investment into clinical trials. We are funding clinical trials for therapies. At the same time, we are also working quite closely with industry. We have an existing partnership called ""Innovative Medicines Initiative"". This partnership with the pharmaceutical industry is now of course looking into COVID,"" explains Jean-Eric Paquet, Director-General of DG Research & Innovation at the European Commission.

""What we are also providing is a platform around the European Open Science Cloud to allow researchers to share their research results, but also to share the data of those results. And this is increasingly taking up, and this I think will also very much help to bring together the more global efforts around the Science against COVID-19,"" he adds.

In Rotterdam researchers taking part in another European funded project are studying to see if antibodies offer sufficient protection against the virus. They say they are confident their research will eventually result in multiple strategies to fight COVID-19.

""We can use the antibodies for diagnostics. That's number one. Number two would be to use the antibodies as a prophylactic, so give them to people who are at risk of infection, so that they don't get infected. And number three would be to use it as a therapeutic to treat patients who have been infected,"" says Franck Grosveld, a cell biologist at the Erasmus University Medical Center.",mainstream
1244,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently granted an “emergency use authorization” of a blood test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. It is the first such test to receive approval for the U.S. market. And it comes at a time when health experts and leaders are embracing immunity as a potential end point to the pandemic. In Colorado, a company that makes a coronavirus antibody test has donated kits to the state’s San Miguel County so that everyone there can be tested if they want to. And in Italy, politicians want to use antibody status to determine which people will get “back to work” passes.

Several ambitious surveys to test for these antibodies have now been launched around the globe. The World Health Organization’s Solidarity II study will pool antibody data from more than half a dozen countries. In the U.S., a collaborative multiyear project aims to provide a picture of nationwide antibody prevalence. Its first phase is already collecting samples from blood donors in six major urban areas, including New York City, Seattle and Minneapolis. And the effort will evolve into three national surveys of donors, supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and conducted this fall and in the fall of 2021.

Unlike diagnostic tests, which are used to confirm the presence and sometimes load, or amount, of the virus, antibody tests help determine whether or not someone was previously infected—even if that person never showed symptoms. Widespread use of such assays could give scientists greater insight into how deadly the virus is and how widely it has spread throughout the population.

It is less clear what those antibody tests mean for real life, however, because immunity functions on a continuum. With some pathogens, such as the varicella-zoster virus (which causes chicken pox), infection confers near-universal, long-lasting resistance. Natural infection with Clostridium tetani, the bacterium that causes tetanus, on the other hand, offers no protection—and even people getting vaccinated for it require regular booster shots. On the extreme end of this spectrum, individuals infected with HIV often have large amounts of antibodies that do nothing to prevent or clear the disease.

At this early stage of understanding the new coronavirus, it is unclear where COVID-19 falls on the immunity spectrum. Although most people with SARS-CoV-2 seem to produce antibodies, “we simply don’t know yet what it takes to be effectively protected from this infection,” says Dawn Bowdish, a professor of pathology and molecular medicine and Canada Research Chair in Aging and Immunity at McMaster University in Ontario. Researchers are scrambling to answer two questions: How long do SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stick around? And do they protect against reinfection?

Early on, some people—most notably U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson (who has the virus and is currently in intensive care) and his government’s scientific adviser Patrick Vallance—touted hopes that herd immunity could be an eventual means for ending the pandemic. And although it appears that recovered COVID-19 patients have antibodies for at least two weeks, long-term data are still lacking. So many scientists are looking to other coronaviruses for answers.

Immunity to seasonal coronaviruses (such as those that cause common colds), for example, starts declining a couple of weeks after infection. And within a year, some people are vulnerable to reinfection. That observation is disconcerting when experts say it is unlikely we will have a vaccine for COVID-19 within 18 months. But studies of SARS-CoV—the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which shares a considerable amount of its genetic material with SARS-CoV-2—are more promising. Antibody testing shows SARS-CoV immunity peaks at around four months and offers protection for roughly two to three years. As Preeti Malani, chief health officer and a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan, said in a video interview with JAMA Editor in Chief Howard Bauchner,this period presents “a pretty good time line for thinking about vaccines and therapeutics” for COVID-19.

Even if the antibodies stick around in the body, however, it is not yet certain that they will prevent future infection. What we want, Bowdish says, are neutralizing antibodies. These are the proteins that reduce and prevent infection by binding to the part of a virus that connects to and “unlocks” host cells. They are relatively easy to detect, and they are far easier for vaccine developers to generate than the alternative: the immune system’s T cells. In contrast, nonneutralizing antibodies still recognize parts of the pathogen, but they do not bind effectively and so do not prevent it from invading cells.

“If humans naturally make neutralizing antibodies [against SARS-CoV-2], then all we have to do is figure out what [sites they are] binding on the virus and really target that one little piece of protein, and that’s our magic bullet,” Bowdish says. For SARS-CoV-2, that target site is most likely on the so-called receptor-binding domain of its spike glycoprotein—a protein attached to a sugar that the virus uses to enter cells. But, Bowdish says, this spot may present a challenge because human immune systems are not very good at making antibodies against sugar-coated substances.

Nevertheless, a few small studies of cells in laboratory dishes suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the production of neutralizing antibodies. And animal studies indicate such antibodies do prevent reinfection, at least for a couple of weeks. Furthermore, because some antibodies seem to recognize and react to the spike proteins on multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (the virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS), researchers can build on knowledge learned from previous outbreaks.

Research on real-life immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is in its preliminary stages, and uncertainties remain. One study found no correlation between viral load and antibody presence, leading the authors to question the antibodies’ actual role in clearing the virus in humans. In addition, peer-reviewed research on SARS-CoV and preprint studies on SARS-CoV-2 report that some nonneutralizing coronavirus antibodies might trigger a harmful immune response upon reinfection with those pathogens or cross infection with other coronaviruses. Thus, while much of the emerging research is promising, Bowdish cautions against using antibody testing to drive policy until researchers know the proportion of COVID-19 survivors who are producing neutralizing antibodies.

In an ideal world, SARS-CoV-2 immunity would resemble that acquired by children who get chicken pox. Early research suggests we are in for a much more complex scenario but one that time and unprecedented global cooperation might be able to untangle. Eventually antibody tests could be the key to getting our lives and economies back on track. For now, they promise to give experts, officials and citizens a clearer picture of the pandemic.

1108,"Pfizer says it will begin testing the experimental vaccine in the United States as early as next week, and says a vaccine could be ready for emergency use in the fall, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.

Mainz-based BioNTech reported that the first cohort of participants had been given doses of the potential vaccine, BNT162, in a Phase 1/2 clinical study in Germany.

""Twelve study participants have been vaccinated with the vaccine candidate BNT162 in Germany since the start of the study on April 23, 2020,"" the company said in a statement.

No information on the results is currently available. BioNTech said around 200 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years old would be given doses ranging from 1µg (microgram) to 100µg to find the optimal dose for further studies.

""In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine will be investigated,"" added the biotech company. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to initiate trials for BNT162 in the US on regulatory approval, expected shortly, the statement said. Some anti-vaxxers are changing their minds because of the coronavirus pandemic The German Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Drugs approved the trial -- the country's first clinical trial for a vaccine against Covid 19 -- on April 22.

""The companies estimate that there is potential to supply millions of vaccine doses by the end of 2020, subject to technical success of the development program and approval by regulatory authorities, and the potential to rapidly scale up the capacity to produce hundreds of millions of doses in 2021."" Pfizer isn't the only group with a potential Covid-19 vaccine in the works. Last week, scientists at Oxford University's Jenner Institute in the United Kingdom began testing its vaccine on humans Thursday and, depending on the trial results, could be ready as early as September.

896,"Twenty years ago one of the most serious public health scandals of the 20th century emerged – when the British doctor Andrew Wakefield published a paper in the medical journal, The Lancet. It suggested there was a link between MMR - the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine - and autism. His work would be later completely discredited as “an elaborate fraud” and retracted. Wakefield himself was struck off the medical register in the UK. But the ripples surrounding his claims are still being felt all over the world – as anti-vaccine movements continue to drive down inoculation rates, particularly in developed countries. The result has been outbreaks of measles in Europe and the United states – where it was once almost eradicated. The scandal also played a key role in undermining trust in science.

480,"Elena Conis’ Vaccine Nation examines the changing perceptions of vaccines in the United States. In the early 1960s, vaccines were held in great confidence by the public, and scientists hoped that vaccines could be used to eradicate common childhood diseases such as mumps and rubella. Yet this optimism soon gave way as critiques of vaccination became increasingly popular. Conis traces the disparate influences of environmentalism, feminism, and cultural politics in creating an anti-vaccination movement

Conis begins the book in the Kennedy Administration after briefly reviewing the successful vaccination campaigns aimed at polio and smallpox. Kennedy and other lawmakers saw federal involvement with the 1962 Vaccination Assistance Act as a cost-effective way to improve public health (20). Vaccination also played into concerns about national security: improving the health of American children was critical at a time when a fifth of applicants to the U.S. military were being rejected (27).

More serious diseases such as polio and smallpox were disappearing or had already been eradicated in the United States, and now federal attention was turned to so-called dirty diseases such as measles. Modern confidence in science was such that many believed these older diseases could and should be eradicated. Conis writes, “Nature was something to be overcome with technological breakthroughs and scientific expertise” (54).

Yet doctors weren’t in lockstep regarding the benefits of vaccines, especially regarding mumps, which was regarded as a harmless and comical disease of childhood. These diseases, once understood as an inescapable fact of childhood, were now targeted because of the damage they could to do a young child’s development (52). Vaccine manufacturers such as Merck expounded on the threat that these diseases could pose, such as the risk of sterility from mumps. Vaccine manufacturers and public health officials pushed the vaccine as part of responsible parenthood, especially after a combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine became available. While mumps was never fully eradicated, by 1985 there were just 3,000 cases in the U.S., down by 98% from 1968.

The next major federal push for immunization came during the Carter Administration as the Childhood Immunization Initiative. Rather than relying on the federal government to immunize children, Carter used celebrities, PTAs, corporate leaders, and governors to force states to tighten their vaccination laws combined with parental education campaigns to push vaccination rates up. It was a cost-saving measure that Conis asserts reflected the general philosophy of Carter and his administration, which favored decentralized control over medicine and a reduced federal presence (88).

Carter’s initiative also reflected changing American concerns with healthcare. Health care costs were rising precipitously. In Carter’s view, a major part of the problem was that few Americans seriously tried to prevent serious diseases before they happened. Responsible parents needed to be active in protecting their children with immunization. Pushing vaccination as a way to keep health care costs low was a less-expensive way to tackle the larger problem. Carter’s initiative was the high-water mark of public confidence in vaccination, and by 1980 96% of children were being immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, and other diseases. At the same time, several disparate cultural movements posed new challenges to public confidence in vaccination.

Second-wave feminism was one such movement. As caregivers, women traditionally bore the burden of overseeing vaccinations. Yet second-wave feminism challenged the patriarchal nature of medicine by trying to give women agency over women’s health issues (114). Magazines such as Mothering urged women to be cautious with the measles vaccine, for example, because the vaccine could sicken those allergic to eggs. When women expressed concerns about complications from the pertussis vaccine, doctors brushed them aside. The effect was that women increasingly questioned the utility of vaccinations, especially in their role as a responsible parent.

The burgeoning environmental movement also posed a challenge, as environmental concerns clashed with the scientific triumphalism of the 1960s. Even in the nineteenth century, some people had feared that vaccines transmitted poisons or animal matter into the human body (133). Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring ushered in new fears of radiation and heavy metals in the environment, and critics of vaccination would frequently compare vaccines with environmental pollutants. By the early 1990s, authors such as Harris Coulter were proposing that vaccinations were responsible for psychiatric disturbances, including the behavior of serial killer Ted Bundy (148). In the view of environmentalists, nature had an intrinsic value, and it was better to let nature run its course with diseases like the chicken pox.

The hepatitis B vaccine was developed in 1982, largely to immunize health care workers. At that time, the disease barely existed in the public imagination (182). Yet concern about the disease grew throughout the ‘90s, and officials hoped to vaccinate schoolchildren to eradicate the disease. The vaccinations proved to be deeply divisive and set off fears over the vaccines’ safety and the moral imperative to vaccinate children for a disease spread by “adult” behavior.

In the early 2000s, vaccine-safety advocates stoked fears that vaccines were causing autism. While the evidence was widely debunked by scientists, news media seized on one aspect of the story: the misinformed, irrational parent who refused to get their kids vaccinated (223). This perspective greatly oversimplified the debate, Conis argues, by eliminating any discussion around side-effects from vaccination or dealing with barriers created by poverty and the health care system.

The author ends the book with a discussion of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. HPV went from being a disease that only a few people had heard of to a leading cause of cervical cancer. The vaccine sparked a large debate over the vaccination of school-age girls, ranging from concerns over teenage sexuality to safety concerns as well as intrusion by public health officials. Teenaged girls also had a voice in this discussion, as emerging social media meant that adolescents could offer their own insights.

The book is about two separate but connected narratives: the development of various vaccines and the creation of a public forum in which they can be debated. At the start of the book, scientists and politicians effectively own and control the debate. Some figures on the political fringe question the efficacy or use of vaccines, but their voices are largely discounted. By the end of the book, public opinion is an essential part of policy, and policy is consistently framed around what is “responsible parenthood.” As more voices entered the debate, what exactly made a responsible parent became a heavily debated and divisive topic.

AIDS and the failure to create an AIDS vaccine is strangely absent from this narrative and would have been interesting to use in examining the public attitudes toward vaccination. Much of the book is about the public’s increasing distrust of expert advice. The AIDS epidemic in the 1980s was made worse by a delayed federal response as well as the failure to develop a vaccine, which has fed into popular distrust of public health officials. Nevertheless, this is an interesting and engaging book, one which presents a balanced portrait of debates about vaccines without leaving behind the perspective of scientists and doctors.",mainstream

651,"Trump's executive order rejecting the US's refugee programme to be reversed

Almost 100 Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation on Wednesday to stop Donald Trump's ban on travel to the United States by people from countries connected to terrorism.

""Thousands of American citizens have been forced to live apart from their spouses; their lives put on hold. Thousands of children will not get to spend time with their grandparents,"" Senator Chris Coons said.

""Thousands of people have been denied the opportunity to either grieve the passing of a loved one or to celebrate a marriage or a birth.""

Trump promised to place a temporary ban on immigrants and refugees from specific Middle Eastern countries from entering the country.

In 2017, Trump signed an executive order rejecting the US's refugee programme and blocking travelers from several Muslim-majority countries.

During the ban, many travelers were detained at US airports, and travel disrupted.

Ilhan Omar promised to end, what she described as Trump's 'hateful Muslim ban.'

According to The Hill:

Trump and the White House argue the travel ban is not a Muslim ban.

The policy prevents travelers from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen from entering the U.S., and the administration argues it is necessary to protect national security.

Trump's third executive order issuing the ban was upheld in a 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court last year.

The majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, said Trump was well within his authority to impose the ban based on the president's judgments about national security.

Roberts wrote that it was not the court's place to criticize or pass judgment on comments Trump made on the campaign trail about a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" and that the executive order was neutral in not targeting travelers of a specific religion.

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor lashed out at the court's majority, arguing Trump's comments targeting Muslims should have led the justices to strike down the ban.

Legislation introduced to overturn the ban is unlikely to become law with Trump in the White House and Republicans holding a majority in the Senate.

“This is not a bill that I expect to become law in this administration,” Coons acknowledged on MSNBC.

882,"Here are some of the most well-known myths about vaccines as well as the reality.

TRUTH: This myth gained popularity when children were diagnosed with autism around the time that they received the MMR vaccine (around 18 months of age), according to Joyce Allers, RN, with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. (There was also a now-discredited study published in Lancet in 1998 alleging a connection.) At the time, the mercury-containing preservative Thimerosal was being put in some vaccines – although not the MMR vaccine – to keep bacteria from growing, so many people connected that to autism. However, there appears to be no link between previous use of Thimerosal and autism. Thimerosal was completely removed from all infant vaccines in the United States in 2001, yet autism rates continue to increase. ""Study after study has shown that there is no link between vaccines and autism,"" says Angie Matthiessen with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.

Thimerosal is currently present only in minute amounts in the influenza vaccine. There are also Thimerosal-free influenza vaccines.

MYTH: Vaccines aren't necessary anymore because all the diseases are gone anyway.

TRUTH: According to the CDC, if we stopped vaccinating, many diseases that are largely unknown would come back with a vengeance. The only vaccine-preventable disease that's been completely wiped out is smallpox. ""These diseases are coming into our country, into our schools and into our workplace,"" says Matthiessen. ""Don't believe that your child is 100 percent protected because the disease isn't currently in the United States. International travel and adoption are two of the ways that dangerous diseases make their way into the country.""

Measles, which the U.S. considered wiped out in 2000 has returned. There were 1,282 cases of measles in the U.S. in 2019. The CDC attributed the outbreak to ""an increase in the number of travelers who get measles abroad and bring it into the U.S., and a spread of measles in U.S. communities with pockets of unvaccinated people."" Some Americans have become resistant to immunizing their children, which has contributed to the spread of some childhood diseases that were once seldom seen.

MYTH: Babies are too fragile to get so many shots.

TRUTH: ""A lot of young parents are worried about giving their babies so many shots, thinking that they will overwhelm their immune system,"" says Allers. ""I tell them that as human beings we are exposed to disease all the time, like at the mall and church, so we can't overwhelm their systems."" According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Vaccine Education Center, diseases often occur in very young infants, so the best way to prevent them is to give vaccines as soon as possible after birth. ""We have a wonderful history of eliminating disease, but what worries us is all the good progress we've made is going to be diminished by families choosing their own vaccination schedule or choosing not to vaccinate at all,"" Allers says.

MYTH: A live vaccine can give me the disease it's supposed to prevent.

TRUTH: As we've discussed, live vaccines can cause extremely mild symptoms. However, experts agree that they are very minor and much better than coming down with the full-blown disease.

768,"This two-way relationship may be an unlikely key to solving one of medicine's most pressing—and perplexing—mysteries: autism. Nearly 60 years after the disorder was first identified, the number of cases has surged, and the United Nations estimates that up to 70 million people worldwide fall on the autism spectrum. Yet there is no known cause or cure.

But scientists have found promising clues in the gut. Research has revealed striking differences in the trillions of bacteria - collectively known as the microbiome—in the intestines of autistic and healthy children. But the gut bacteria in autistic individuals aren't just different. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have shown for the first time that they may actually contribute to the disorder. Last month, they reported in the journal Cell that an experimental probiotic therapy alleviated autism-like behaviors in mice and are already planning a clinical trial.

Today autism is treated primarily through behavioral therapy. But the new study suggests that treatment may one day come in the form of a probiotic—live, ""friendly"" bacteria like those found in yogurt. ""If you block the gastrointestinal problem, you can treat the behavioral symptoms,"" Paul Patterson, a professor of biology at Caltech who co-authored the study, told SFARI.org. University of Colorado Boulder professor Rob Knight hailed the finding as ""groundbreaking"" in a commentary in Cell.

Autism is a complex spectrum of disorders that share three classic features - impaired communication, poor social engagement and repetitive behaviors. On one end of the spectrum are people who are socially awkward but, in many cases, incredibly bright. At the other extreme are individuals with severe mental disabilities and behavioral problems.

Among autistic children's most common health complaints? Gastrointestinal problems. Although estimates vary widely, some studies have concluded that up to 90 percent of autistic children suffer from tummy troubles. According to the CDC, they're more than 3.5 times more likely to experience chronic diarrhea and constipation than their normally developing peers.

Following these hints, Arizona State University researchers analyzed the gut bacteria in fecal samples obtained from autistic and normally developing children. They found that autistic participants had many fewer types of bacteria, probably making the gut more susceptible to attack from disease-causing pathogens. Other studies have also found striking differences in the types and abundance of gut bacteria in autistic versus healthy patients.

But is the gut microbiome in autistic individuals responsible for the disorder? To find out, Caltech postdoctoral researcher Elaine Hsiao engineered mice based on earlier studies showing that women who get the flu during pregnancy double their risk of giving birth to an autistic child. In the mouse model, pregnant females injected with a mock virus gave birth to pups with autism-like symptoms, such as obsessive grooming, anxiety and aloofness.

But how did these bacteria influence behavior? To find out, Hsiao analyzed the mice's blood. The blood of ""autistic"" mice contained a whopping 46 times more 4EPS, a molecule produced by gut bacteria, thought to have seeped from their intestines. What's more, injecting healthy mice with 4EPS made them more anxious. A similar molecule has been detected at elevated levels in autistic patients.

Five weeks later, the leaky gut in ""autistic"" mice had sealed up, and the levels of 4EPS in their blood had plummeted. Their gut microbiomes had come to more closely resemble those of healthy mice—and so did their behavior. They were less anxious and more vocal, and stopped obsessively burying marbles in their cages.

But the treated mice remained aloof when a new mouse was placed in their cage. ""This is a real limitation in the conclusions from this study as, in many ways, social interaction deficits are at the core ... of autism,"" Ted Abel, a professor of biology at the University of Pennsylvania, told SFARI.org.

Still, autism researchers shouldn't underestimate the importance of gut bacteria, said John Cryan, a professor of anatomy and neuroscience at University Cork College. In 2011, his group reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that probiotic-fed mice were less anxious and produced fewer stress hormones.""You have this kilo of microbes in your gut that's as important as the kilo of nerve cells in your brain,"" he said. ""We need to do much more studies on autistic biota.""

For autistic patients and their families, however, even a supplemental therapy for a subset of sufferers is a huge step forward. ""It's really impactful, this notion that by changing the bacteria, you could ameliorate what's often considered an intractable disorder,"" Hsiao said. ""It's a really crazy notion and a big advance.""",mainstream
147,"As the world races to combat the coronavirus, one nation is notably absent from multinational efforts: the United States. But scientists say that for now, the international research community is working together to do all it can.

Global actors are joining forces on multiple fronts to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control. On April 24, the World Health Organization (WHO) held a virtual conference to launch an international collaboration to accelerate the development and production of the health technologies necessary to do so. The United States did not participate in the conference, which culminated in a joint call for action.

Next Monday, May 4, the European Commission will respond to that call by hosting a global virtual conference to raise money from countries and business foundations to fund the development of tests, treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus. It has invited “governments, business leaders, public figures, philanthropists, artists and citizens” to help with its efforts to raise the €7.5 billion it has set as its initial target. Announced partners include France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway and Saudi Arabia. It remains unclear if the US will take part.

Under President Donald Trump’s “America First” doctrine, the US has tended to favour unilateral action and eschew cooperation with international organisations. Case in point: On March 14, Trump announced that he was suspending funding to the WHO, which has spearheaded the global response to the pandemic. With an annual input of about $400 million, the US is the biggest contributor to the organisation; the reduction in funds comes at a vital moment.

What all that will mean in the battle against a virus that – as global health experts have repeatedly reminded us – knows no borders and requires coordinated action remains to be seen.

On the scientific front, the impact may be minimal. While global cooperation and the sharing of expertise and information is critical, it also happens largely without government involvement and, as of now, continues unimpeded, said Laurent Humeau, chief scientific officer at Inovio Pharmaceuticals.

Humeau’s team has relied on the sequencing of the genome provided by China, genetic material from Australia and has cooperated with researchers in South Korea and the UK. “It’s a community that is moving very fast and we need everyone else’s help to get a vaccine,” he said. “It’s absolutely critical for us to have this network of scientists.”

The Inovio team is part of the WHO’s R & D Blueprint, which pulls together a coalition of experts and allows for “the rapid activation of research and development activities during epidemics”.

And despite the public distance between the US and the WHO, key health personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health continue to be part of the global scientific dialogue. For now, the international research community is working together to do all it can. “We keep pushing as fast – it’s not as fast as we can run, but as fast as we can fly,” Humeau said.

Unless governments issue restrictions – such as those the US imposed on stem-cell research – politics tends to exist in a sphere separate from science, said Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group and who also edits the international journal Vaccine. “You’re not working in a political framework – at least in the US – you’re working in a scientific framework,” Poland said.

Researchers end up primarily communicating through journals and meetings and, perhaps most importantly in the current crisis, on ""preprint servers"", where researchers place articles before they have gone through peer review and been published. “That has been the primary way that scientists have been communicating with one another,” Poland said.

There may even be a silver lining to a little bit of distance between researchers, said Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. “The US and Europe sometimes have different approaches to vaccine development and how to support vaccine science, and that may not be so bad because it creates additional opportunities for innovation,” he said.

Poland hopes that this pandemic, unlike the ones that preceded it, will finally have helped people understand how interrelated their nations are. “We’ve had multiple examples now, that anything that happens anywhere on this globe is maybe, at most, 36 hours away from Europe or North America,” he said. “There’s where you need a lot of cooperation, for example, on surveillance, on what is happening where, because – literally – days are lives.”

Finding a vaccine is only a first step, warned David Salisbury, associate fellow in the Global Health Programme at Chatham House. “The fact that scientists are talking to each other is admirable, because sharing what we are learning about vaccine development is, of course, hugely important,"" Salisbury said. “But that is the beginning of the story … Ultimately, we’ve got to get from developing a vaccine to manufacturing and buying it country by country, and then we’re into a political world that has left the scientists behind … The critical thing is not when do we get the first dose, it’s when do we get enough.”

Manufacturing and distributing a vaccine will be herculean tasks for a disease that potentially affects everyone on the planet, and that’s where a new set of potential problems arises. “You could imagine a philosophy of America First that might actually prevent vaccines manufactured in the US from leaving the US until everyone [there] had been vaccinated,” Salisbury said. “Or what if the EU says we will prioritise European customers first? Geopolitics becomes really important in what becomes available when and for whom.”

Salisbury said that countries that can’t afford to pay market rate also risk getting pushed to the bottom of “this great long list of customers”. The international community needs to consider carefully how what are certain to be scarce supplies to begin with get distributed.

“How do we share a hugely valuable resource equitably?” he asked. “I don’t know that we have a solution yet.”",mainstream
450,"Kentucky Derby fans may need to take some extra precautions before heading off to the races.

The Indiana State Department of Health is recommending that its residents get vaccinated against hepatitis A and take other steps to protect themselves from the illness before traveling to Kentucky or Michigan, both of which are experiencing large outbreaks of the viral infection.

Kentucky has reported more than 300 cases of hepatitis A since November 2017, with 39 new cases reported in the first week of April, according to the Kentucky Department for Public Health. Most cases in the state have occurred around Louisville — the city where the Kentucky Derby is held. The famous horse race, which draws more than 150,000 people each year, takes place on the first Saturday in May.

""With popular tourist events coming up in other states, we know many Hoosiers will be traveling to areas impacted by hepatitis A, and we want them to be safe,"" Pam Pontones, the Indiana deputy state health commissioner, said in a statement. ""Getting vaccinated and thoroughly washing your hands before and after preparing food and eating and after using the restroom are simple, safe and effective ways to prevent the spread of hepatitis A.""

But do you really need to get a hepatitis A vaccine if you're going to the Kentucky Derby?

Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the Indiana recommendation is an interesting step to take, and it's not a bad idea. ""I can see why they would advise it,"" Adalja said. ""It's something that's an easy measure that can minimize risk."" [27 Devastating Infectious Diseases]

At the same time, Adalja told Live Science that the risk of hepatitis A probably isn't very high for the average visitor to the Derby. A number of recent U.S. hepatitis A outbreaks, including the one in Kentucky, have occurred primarily among the homeless population and illicit-drug users — a group that may have limited access to clean toilets and handwashing facilities, which are important in preventing the spread of hepatitis A.

But hepatitis A outbreaks can also occur through contaminated food, Adalja noted — for instance, if food workers contract the illness and handle food without properly washing their hands. (The Kentucky hepatitis A outbreak has not been linked with contaminated food, although it was recently reported that a McDonald's employee in Berea, Kentucky, south of Lexington, had the infection and could have potentially spread it to customers.) If Kentucky Derby-goers want to minimize their risk of getting the illness, ""the vaccine is one way to do that,"" Adalja said.

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus is spread through the ""fecal-oral"" route — that is, when small amounts of stool from an ill person contaminate objects, food or drinks that are then touched and ingested by another person, the CDC says. For this reason, thorough handwashing — particularly after using the bathroom or changing a child's diaper, or before eating — can help reduce a person's risk of getting hepatitis A, according to the Mayo Clinic.

It's important to note that the Indiana announcement is not a nationwide recommendation. In general, the CDC recommends the hepatitis vaccine for children at age 1, as well as adults who may be at higher risk for hepatitis A or for complications from the illness. These include travelers to countries where hepatitis A is common, people who use recreational drugs, people with chronic liver disease, men who have sexual contact with other men, and people who have direct contact with others who have hepatitis A.

The CDC says that ideally, a person should get the hepatitis vaccine two weeks or more before departing for their trip, but getting the vaccine any time before travel will provide some protection.

Adalja noted that a number of Americans are already vaccinated against hepatitis A. The vaccine was first licensed in 1995 and was recommended for all U.S. children starting in 2006. But that would still leave many adults today unvaccinated, unless they already got the vaccine for travel or because they fall into a group that's at higher risk for contracting the illness.

Symptoms of hepatitis A infection usually don't appear until two to six weeks after a person has been infected, and include fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, dark-yellow urine, joint pain and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and eyes), according to the CDC.

People with the infection usually get better on their own without a specific treatment, but in some cases, the infection can lead to liver failure, particularly in older adults or people who have other liver diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health.",mainstream
513,"Here are just a handful of the high crimes and misdemeanors committed by Barack Hussein Obama.



He lied to the American people when he said we could keep our private insurance, knowing full well that his legislation would inevitably drive private insurers out of business.



Gerald Walpin, Inspector General of the Corporation For National and Community Service investigated Kevin Johnson, a big buddy of the president, for misuse of funds from an AmeriCorps grant. Whereupon Obama vindictively fired Walpin to cover for Johnson. A subsequent investigation vindicated Walpin's judgment in the matter.



Barack Hussein Obama has overseen the effective takeover by government of banks, the largest insurance company (AIG), and General Motors (GM) and Chrysler... the bulk of the U.S. auto industry, thus depriving bondholders, shareholders, and others of their property.



Barack Hussein Obama is actively pursuing cap-and-trade legislation. Instead of taxing the very air we breathe, it would instead, in a manner of speaking, tax the air we exhale and give the government unprecedented control over the economy and American businesses.



Barack Hussein Obama is running up our debt at an alarming rate. In just 9 months since Obama assumed office, our National Debt has gone up by over a trillion dollars. To put that figure in perspective, it took George W. Bush 8 years to add 4.8 trillion to the National Debt.



And, to add insult to injury, we're printing money like it's going out of style. The effect will be hyper-inflation, a crippling of our economy and, quite possibly, personal hardship on a scale that has not been experienced since the Great Depression.



Barack Hussein Obama has appointed countless ""Czars"" to oversee everything from the closing of Guantanamo to the food we eat. These Czars don't have to be approved by the Senate. The Czars have unprecedented power and report only to Obama. Members of both parties are disturbed by these extra-Constitutional excrescences.



Senator Robert Byrd said: ""The accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances."" Congressman Jack Kingston called the Czars a ""parallel government.""



And finally, Obama has consistently refused to approve the release of his actual birth certificate, college transcripts and his medical records.



And these matters only scratch the surface.

It's almost as if Obama is intentionally trying to destroy the country. 



Barack Hussein Obama has said that America is not a Christian nation, on countless occasions, despite surveys that find a whopping majority say the contrary.



In his book, The Audacity of Hope, he wrote of Muslims and Arabic immigrants: ""... I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.""



When he spoke at Georgetown University, a Catholic institution, the White House insisted that the name of Jesus, be covered. Georgetown complied.



In 2006, he said; ""Whatever we once were, we are no longer a Christian nation."" He went to Egypt and said, ""You might say that America is a Muslim nation.""



Why go to such lengths to deny the Christian heritage of the United States?



Surely Barack Hussein Obama knows that our personal liberties flow directly from our Christian heritage... that there is no surer way to destroy our republic than to deny that heritage.



President Thomas Jefferson: ""God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?""



President Andrew Jackson called the Bible; ""the Rock upon which our republic rests.""



President John Adams said; ""We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion.""



Patrick Henry said, ""It is when a people forget God, that tyrants forge their chains.""



George Washington, in his Farewell Address said; ""Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.""



Alexis de Tocqueville, in Democracy in America, wrote extensively on the relationship between the Christian religion and liberty in American: ""America is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.""



It's enough to make one wonder... does Barack Hussein Obama realize that every stab he takes at the Christian heritage of this great nation is a blow to the very foundation of our nation... a blow to freedom our personal liberty?

Does he simply hate Christianity... does he hate the United States... or both? 



Barack Hussein Obama simply hasn't denied the Christian heritage of this nation. He has used his presidency to bad-mouth America itself at every turn.



He said, ""America has been arrogant."" thus giving our enemies and our allies every reason to believe that we are less resolved to defend ourselves and hence more vulnerable to attack.



Following his inauguration, he ordered Gitmo closed, within a year, despite the fact that it was (and is) the best possible facility for detaining terrorists.



His first presidential phone call was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Fatah Party in the Palestine territory. According to press reports he told Abbas; ""This is my first phone call to a foreign leader and I'm making it only hours after I took office.""



His first one-on-one TV interview was not with NBC or ABC, but with Al Arabiya, where he said: ""My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect.""



He immediately issued an Executive Order halting military commissions which resulted in charges being dropped against Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the animal accused of planning numerous terrorist attacks against Americans, including the USS Cole bombing in which 17 U.S. sailors died.



While treating the Queen of England with casual familiarity, he obsequiously bowed from the waist to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, leader of a Muslim nation that won't permit Christian worship within its borders... under penalty of death.



Are Obama's denunciations of America, in words and deeds, simply faux-pas or do they show, as Tammy Bruce said, ""malevolence toward this country, which is unabated.""



Does it really matter?



Barack Hussein Obama's words and actions clearly rise well beyond the level of ""bad behavior"" and our Founding Fathers left us a remedy for presidents guilty of bad behavior.



The Obama presidency is the disease; Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, is the cure.

1329,"I have already written about the currency reset and other features of a technocratic future waiting in the wings. —New levels of visible surveillance, social credit scores, universal guaranteed income, Internet of Things, energy-use quotas, smart cities.

—Events can move in several directions, going forward. In this article, I explore one of those directions.

The occasion is this fake pandemic; the big hammer is the vaccine against the phony COVID.

As Fauci mentioned a couple of months ago, it could be a DNA vaccine—new technology—which means it is really gene therapy. Synthesized genes are injected into the body. They purportedly set up immunity. Actually, they PERMANENTLY alter the genetic makeup of the recipient.

As you can imagine, this creates the opportunity to put many different genes into humans. To try to invent “new humans.”

The so-called immunity certificates Fauci is now talking about? They would be issued to people who test positive on the new antibody tests for COVID-19—which is an interesting turnaround, because, since 1984, positive tests results have generally been taken to mean “infected.” Why the shift?

Because there is a need for these immunity certificates—as an INTRO to condition the population to an IDEA.

If and when the COVID vaccine arrives, the certificates would be used to signify immunity for all those who take the shot.

It would function as a license. Your passport into the Brave New World. You’re “immune,” so you’re allowed to move out of fear mode. And circulate and travel and enter schools…

For DNA vaccines, the reference is the New York Times, 3/15/15, “Protection Without a Vaccine.” It describes the frontier of research. Here are key quotes that illustrate the use of synthetic genes to “protect against disease,” while changing the genetic makeup of humans. This is not science fiction:

“By delivering synthetic genes into the muscles of the [experimental] monkeys, the scientists are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.”

“’The sky’s the limit,’ said Michael Farzan, an immunologist at Scripps and lead author of the new study.”

“The first human trial based on this strategy — called immunoprophylaxis by gene transfer, or I.G.T. — is underway, and several new ones are planned.” [That was five years ago.]

“I.G.T. is altogether different from traditional vaccination. It is instead a form of gene therapy. Scientists isolate the genes that produce powerful antibodies against certain diseases and then synthesize artificial versions. The genes are placed into viruses and injected into human tissue, usually muscle.”

Here is the punchline: “The viruses invade human cells with their DNA payloads, and the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient’s own DNA. If all goes well, the new genes instruct the cells to begin manufacturing powerful antibodies.”

Read that again: “the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient’s own DNA.”

The Times article taps Dr. David Baltimore for an opinion:

“Still, Dr. Baltimore says that he envisions that some people might be leery of a vaccination strategy that means altering their own DNA, even if it prevents a potentially fatal disease.”

Yes, some people might be leery. If they have two or three working brain cells.

This is genetic roulette with a loaded gun.

And the further implications are clear. Vaccines can be used as a cover for the injections of any and all genes, whose actual purpose is unannounced.",conspiracy
754,"Why Do We Still Vaccinate? – 25 Questions From A Former Vaccine Advocate

I used to be pro vaccine. I know the feeling of thinking others were just plain crazy and wrong for not vaccinating their children and themselves. ‘Irresponsible!’ I said when pointing my finger. I’d use the same old arguments about polio and small pox and how vaccines saved us from all those horrible diseases and just swallowing and regurgitating the propaganda I was brought up with. It was only recently, in 2009 that I started questioning my long held beliefs and began digging in to the history, efficacy and safety of vaccines. I was appalled at what I found and the recklessness of those government health agencies entrusted with our health and our children’s safety, and angry with myself that I had put my family’s health at risk by blind faith in others when I was ultimately responsible for the medical decisions of my family.

When I began to put this article together I specifically chose not to include research from or links to websites that are considered untrustworthy by most pro-vaxxers, sites such as Natural News, Mercola, etc. even though I personally trust those sites and much more than I would WebMd and for good reason [a]. Instead I chose to employ basic logic and also incorporate independent and .gov scientific studies-mostly peer review, journals, news from mainstream sources (that pro-vaxxers love and totally trust) and articles that link to other .gov scientific studies, as well as government statistical resources. So, I started writing down questions and then looking for answers. I’ll admit, some of these questions have already been asked by others, but I just expanded upon it to form a helpful list.



I hope the following information helps you in your lifelong journey in search of health, vitality and truth in your own lives and your children’s lives.

1. Why are newborn babies vaccinated on their first day of life against a disease that is primarily transmitted sexually and by needles in drug users?

 (Pregnant women are already tested for STD’s prior to birth so there’s no reason to give it to an infant). Interesting to note, of the few vaccines that still are given to infants and STILL has thimerasol in it is Hep B and DipTet (and Flu shot recommended to pregnant women). So, the claim that it has been removed from all vaccines is a lie and misdirection. If they give it to all newborns then ALL the newborns are getting that thimerasol (mercury derivative). “It was removed from many child vaccines in 2002 but remains in some vaccines (e.g., hepatitis B virus and)” Page 21.

2. Why are babies given vaccines to produce antibodies when they do not produce antibodies until after the age of 3 to 6 months?

 They get the required antibodies from breastfeeding.

3. Why does the government tell parents to delay breast feeding and get more vaccines when breast feeding babies produce higher levels of antibodies?

4. Why aren’t vaccine manufacturers held responsible when their product injures your child? Why would these companies need to be protected from the effects of such wonderful products?

 (Look into Vaccine Injury Compensation Program .gov and VAERS)

 The Supreme Court ruling exempting the vaccine manufacturers from all liability is done under the explicit understanding that they fall under the category “unavoidably unsafe products.”

9. Why are we frightened of non-fatal illnesses that train a child’s immune system how to behave?

10. Why are vaccine manufacturers allowed to reduce antigens and insert cheap and toxic additives that aggravate the injection site?

11. Why do we need multi-dose vaccines if the number ONE priority of vaccine manufacturers is your child’s safety?

12. Why will no physician sign a written guarantee for a child’s safety prior to vaccinating them with products they insist you take and that they say are completely safe?

13. Why is there no outrage about the 3.1 billion dollars paid out in vaccine injury/death claims and yet they claim there is no correlation and they are perfectly safe? 

 http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreport.pdf

14. Why don’t people recognize from history that the most widespread and lethal diseases in the last 200 years were reduced due to cleaner drinking water, improved sanitation, nutrition, less overcrowded areas and better living conditions? 

 Vaccines were introduced at points in time where every single disease was already declining, most almost completely gone. To give vaccines credit for global reductions in disease is like giving a band-aid credit for healing a wound that was already closing. Dr. Hans Rosling shows exactly how the health condition of nearly all countries of the world have improved with wealth, even 200 years ago, at the times where there no vaccines.

By the late 1950s, even before the introduction of measles vaccine, measles-related deaths and case fatality rates in the United States had decreased markedly, presumably as a result of improvement in health care and nutrition (Oxford Journal of Infectious Diseases).

15. Why do people keep parroting what they hear about ‘Herd Immunity?’

 Herd immunity is a hilarious concept that assumes that 1) Vaccinated people are immune to the diseases for which they’ve been vaccinated, 2) Can not carry the diseases for which they are vaccinated/immune, 3) Because most of the people are vaccinated, other people around them can’t catch the disease. My favourite analogy for herd immunity is that if 95% of people in a building are wearing hard hats when the ceiling falls in, the 5% are protected. (credit Dr. Robert Murdoch)

16. Why are almost all pro-vaxxer adults we talk to not up to date on their adult vaccinations/boosters?

18. Why didn’t our government health agencies ever safety test thimerasol (a mercury derivative and adjuvant) since Lilly developed it in the 1920’s?

 They used it in vaccines from 1930 to 2004! It still is in some vaccines such as the flu vaccine and others. Here is a 2 minute clip, from Congressional Hearings. The EPA themselves acknowledge the toxic effects of mercury:

 22. Why do people still trust their government health agencies when they say vaccines are perfectly safe? 

 With all the big pharma fraud cases, Merck, Glaxo Smith Kline, etc. and all the class action suits that come out several times a year for death/injury you see on tv commercials every week, combine that with the VICP and VAERS .gov statistics, and Iatrogenic Death statistics, why do people still trust their government health agencies when they say vaccines are perfectly safe? Having said that, why is government trusted at all since Democide statistics (death by government) show that nearly 300 million in this last century were killed by the state. Those are non-combatants.

“…A second series of experiments was conducted on mice injected with six doses of aluminum hydroxide. Behavioural analyses in these mice revealed significant impairments in a number of motor functions as well as diminished spatial memory capacity.”

Experimental research, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. click for entire study

Information extracted from studies indicates that: (a) activity of low doses of Thimerosal against isolated human and animal brain cells was found in all studies and is consistent with Hg neurotoxicity; (b) the neurotoxic effect of ethylmercury has not been studied with co-occurring adjuvant-Al in TCVs; (c) animal studies have shown that exposure to Thimerosal-Hg can lead to accumulation of inorganic Hg in brain, and that (d) doses relevant to TCV exposure possess the potential to affect human neuro-development.

Thimerosal, a mercury-containing vaccine preservative, is a suspected factor in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. We previously showed that its administration to infant rats causes behavioral, neurochemical and neuropathological abnormalities similar to those present in autism.

The ACIP’s recommendation of influenza vaccination during pregnancy is not supported by citations in its own policy paper or in current medical literature. Considering the potential risks of maternal and fetal mercury exposure, the administration of thimerosal during pregnancy is both unjustified and unwise. Also, take note of the 71 references at the end of this study.

Confirmation of first BSE case in the United States

The World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) Reference Laboratory for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Weybridge, United Kingdom, confirmed the diagnostic results obtained at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Ames, Iowa, USA, of finding a positive case of BSE in the State of Washington.

The positive Holstein cow was traced back from the slaughter plant, where the positive brain tissue was collected, to a 4,000-animal dairy farm. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) continues to work with the Canadian officials to verify the origin of the index animal. Records indicate that this animal was approximately six and a half years old at the time of slaughter. The age of the animal is significant. She would have been born before feed bans were implemented in North America in August 1997. The feed bans prohibit the inclusion of ruminant protein in feed intended for other ruminants. That practice has been identified as the primary means by which BSE is spread.

The herd the affected animal came from is under a State quarantine in Washington. While USDA has not made any decisions on the dispositions of this herd, any cattle that die on the farm will be tested for BSE. 



On 26 December 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Health informed the World Health Organization (WHO) office in Beijing of a suspected case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a hospital in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province.

The patient, described as a 32-year-old television producer from Guangzhou, is in isolation in hospital. According to information supplied to WHO by the Chinese Ministry of Health, the patient developed a fever and headache on 16 December 2003. On 20 December, he sought medical assistance and was diagnosed as having pneumonia. Chest x-rays showed changes in the lower right lung. He was placed in isolation that day for observation.

The Ministry of Health also reported that all relevant human contacts of the patient have been identified, tested, and are deemed to be doing well, although some remain in isolation, under observation. The Chinese Ministry of Health said epidemiological investigations show that in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient had no known contact with high-risk groups such as health workers or animal handlers. The source of the suspected SARS infection is therefore unclear at this stage.

This is the first suspected SARS case found since 23 May 2003 when WHO lifted the SARS-related travel advisory against Guangdong Province.

Nearly a million chickens and ducks were slaughtered across South Korea to combat a highly contagious strain of avian influenza virus that has spread across the country and could also infect humans. So far there has been no evidence of transmission of avian influenza virus from chickens or ducks to humans during the course of this outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in South Korea.

Avian influenza, which in rare cases can be deadly to humans, has caused poultry sales to tumble as authorities confirm outbreaks at farm after farm across the country. 



UK: variant CJD suspected to have been contracted by blood donation

A man who received blood during an operation in 1997 has developed variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and died. The blood was taken long before the donor was diagnosed with the vCJD. Fifteen other persons have received blood from donors who went on to develop vCJD. All have been contacted and offered counselling. However, none of these has so far gone on to develop the disease, although it may have a long incubation period.

The risks of receiving blood carrying the 'rogue' prions that cause vCJD are largely unknown, although previously thought to be tiny, as no confirmed cases could be identified. In this case, the donor involved gave blood in 1997, and fell ill with [variant] CJD in 1999, dying shortly afterwards. The disease did not develop in the recipient until this year, and the patient died earlier this month. Postmortem results appear to confirm vCJD.

Measures already exist which attempt to cut the risk of CJD transmission during blood transfusions. So far, 143 cases of vCJD have been diagnosed in the United Kingdom, although the number of new cases is falling. There is no established treatment for the illness, which causes massive brain damage and normally kills within months of being detected.

Cluster of cases of tetanus in injecting drug users in England

Eight cases of clinical tetanus, including one death, have been reported in injecting drug users (IDUs) in England since July 2003, six of which occurred since October. The cases are in five women and three men aged between 20 and 47 years, and the latest reported onset date was 17 November 2003. Two of the cases are known to be unimmunised, and one case is known to have received a dose of tetanus toxoid nine years ago. The presentation of these cases so far has ranged from mild trismus to full-blown tetanus and respiratory arrest in the emergency department.

Potential sources for tetanus infection in IDUs are contaminated drugs, paraphernalia, and contaminated skin. The source of infection in this incident is not known. The close clustering of recent cases suggests contamination of drugs, either the drug itself or an adulterant. 



Rabies cases leapt nearly 63 per cent in China in the first nine months of 2003 as the people's affair with pet dogs deepened, the China Daily reported on 25 November 2003. Rabies, 'mad dog disease' in Chinese, killed 1,297 people up to the end of September 2003, far exceeding the 1,003 deaths the Health Ministry reported for all of 2002. This is the fifth straight year that China has seen a big jump in rabies infections. Experts from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention are blaming the trend on pet ownership, the poor quality of rabies vaccines, low public awareness and low vaccination rates among dogs as the major causes of the rapid rise in cases. Another factor was stray dogs running wild on the outskirts of cities and in rural areas. The Ministry said earlier this year that rabies was the most deadly infectious killer in China, well surpassing SARS and AIDS. 



Cases of mumps are at the highest levels for almost a decade. So far this year, there have been more than 2,000 formal notifications of the disease in England, at least half of them thought to be positive. In Wales there have been 323 confirmed cases, compared with just two in 1999.

Public health doctors have warned that in some areas, one child in five starting primary school this year was not protected against the disease. The massive rise in mumps cases is a cause of huge concern for health officials, who have seen the take-up of the triple measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination drop alarmingly because of health scares.

Mumps can cause fever, headache and inflammation of the salivary glands, and occasionally infection of the membrane covering the brain. The disease can also cause permanent deafness. About one in five adolescent or adult males who contracts mumps develops a painful inflammation and swelling of the testicles, which can in a small number of cases result in infertility. Central nervous system complications are not uncommon. Teenagers are the group most at risk because they may have missed out on the MMR, which was introduced in 1988. Some universities are now offering MMR vaccinations to students.

There have been warnings that the fall in the take-up of the MMR, blamed on controversial and hotly disputed links that have been made between the vaccine and autism, will result in more outbreaks of measles and rubella. Less attention has been paid to mumps, which is often considered a benign illness with low mortality rates. However, doctors warn that it should not be underestimated. 



A new 'super' strain of tuberculosis (TB) that is costly and time-consuming to treat has been identified in South Africa's Western Cape Province. The team found that the strain (DRF150) was resistant to almost all antimicrobial agents, used to treat tuberculosis. Usually five drugs are used to combat TB. The DRF150 strain is resistant to four of these.

The new strain had its epicenter in the town of George, about 400 kilometres (250 miles) east of Cape Town, where about 60 cases had been identified. About 20 other cases have been identified in other parts of the Western Cape, but isolates of the new strain have also been found in the South Africa's Northern Province, the Pumalanga Province and in Nairobi, Kenya. Last year 224,420 cases of tuberculosis were reported in South Africa. 



Health officials, on 14 November 2003, confirmed Ebola haemorrhagic fever as the cause of 11 deaths in the northern forests, signalling the Republic of Congo's second outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever this year. Blood specimens from corpses suspected to be infected with Ebola virus have tested positive.

First reports from the remote northern region emerged on 31 October 2003. Ebola haemorrhagic fever, one of the world's deadliest viral diseases, causes rapid death through massive blood loss in up to 90 per cent of those infected. In June 2003, Republic of Congo health authorities announced the end of an Ebola epidemic that killed over 120 people in the same region. That epidemic was believed to have been started by contact with infected gorilla flesh, which is eaten in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The WHO says Ebola haemorrhagic fever has killed more than 1,000 people since the virus was first identified in 1976 in western Sudan and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

1270,"The use of serology in trials of antiviral drugs or physical prophylaxis (masks or condoms) varies by the pathogen under study. For trials to prevent infection with human immunodeficiency virus, in which seroconversion (evidence of a new antibody response to infection) is the gold standard for evidence of new infection, serological measurements at baseline and during and after the trial are routine9. On the other hand, trials of prophylactic drugs or physical prophylaxis are often performed for infections, such as infection with the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum10 or with influenza virus11, respectively, for which immunity is partial and short-lived and is therefore hard to measure at baseline and perhaps difficult to interpret. For this reason, baseline testing has been variable. Nonetheless, in trials of antiviral drugs for prophylaxis of influenza, serology has sometimes been used to assess the proportion of infections that are symptomatic8.

For vaccines with very high efficacy, the bias in efficacy estimates due to unobserved infections is small, so it may not affect estimates much7. That is why vaccine trials rarely (never, to our knowledge) attempt to correct efficacy estimates for undetected or subclinical infections through the use of post-trial serology. They also, to our knowledge, rarely use serostatus at the time of enrollment to stratify analyses, despite recommendations for such analyses in clinical trial guidelines12. For COVID-19, there is little basis on which to predict vaccine efficacy, as no vaccine against coronavirus has been tested for efficacy.

Vaccines are also typically tested for efficacy either in populations with low baseline immunity (e.g., vaccines against measles, for infants) and/or for diseases for which natural immunity is partial and/or short-lived, so it would be difficult to measure (e.g., pneumococcal vaccines)13. Nonetheless, simulations have shown that such trials can be complicated by the interplay between naturally induced immunity and vaccine-induced immunity14. For the Dengvaxia vaccine against dengue fever, researchers gathered but did not immediately analyze serological samples from trial participants. After publication of the original trial results, a secondary analysis of the data showed that the vaccine was most beneficial for people with a prior seropositivity to infection with dengue virus, but that if a person received Dengvaxia while seronegative to infection with dengue virus, the vaccine could prime an ‘enhancement’ of infection that made the symptoms more severe15. This critical aspect of vaccine safety and efficacy could not have been fully understood if serum samples had not been available.

Serological measurement of infection at the end of a vaccine trial is especially important for infections for which asymptomatic infections are very important. This includes infections such as infection with SARS-CoV-2, in which asymptomatic transmission contributes to spread, or infections such as infection with Zika virus, in which asymptomatic infection can produce sequelae with potentially severe consequences, such as congenital Zika syndrome. Serological measurement also matters when failing to do so biases efficacy measurement downward. In sum, serology at the start and end of trials should be more common than it is.",mainstream
842,"A LITTLE boy with autism was allegedly forced out of the cinema after a ""heartless"" woman told his mum that she should have kept him at home.

Vicky Page, 36, took her son Noah, 5, and his two siblings, aged nine and ten to watch Dumbo as a family day out.

But she claims the family were forced to leave after a fellow cinema goer kept giving them dirty looks and said that she ""didn't care"" that Noah had autism and that she should have left him at home.

She said: ""Noah wasn't being naughty, he just got extremely excited.

""He finds it quite hard to stand still when he gets excited.

""He couldn't believe Dumbo could fly but instead of saying things quietly, he shouts things out pretty loud, and he just said 'elephant fly superhero' and then started really jumping.

""A woman and her son kept turning and giving us quite filthy looks.

""I ended up apologising and I said 'I'm really sorry, he has autism'.

""But the woman said 'I don't particularly care' and that I should keep him at home if he can't sit still.

""It made me see red and I think in the end Noah saw me tensing up and I had to leave with my children.

""We went through to the foyer,where he ended up having a full blown meltdown and started headbutting the floor.

""It was very upsetting and I ended up getting quite emotional.""

Vicky added the trip to Faversham's Royal Cinema was a treat for all three children and the family worked hard to prepare Noah for the special outing.

She said: ""We only got half-an-hour into the film, and it is hard for my other two children, as it was a treat for them too.

""They need that treat because it is quite difficult for them as well as we are very limited.

""Our routines have to be quite structured, so they can't have people round to play.

""It is all about countdowns with Noah, so we had been preparing him for the cinema for a week; we can't just think let's go here, there's lots of preparation with him.""

But Vicky, who works with special needs adults, said she is often forced to deal with unwanted comments from passers-by and even avoids supermarkets following similar incidents.

She said: ""I get this sort of thing a lot.

""I try to avoid supermarkets - people tut, or come over to me and say 'if you walk away from him he'll follow you' when he's laying on the floor.

""Or 'if you give him a really hard smack he'll actually start to have some boundaries'.

""This sort of thing happens everywhere with everybody, but it just makes you so cross.

""He does look so normal when he's not having a meltdown, but if you spoke to him you could tell he's got needs.

""He goes to a special needs school, so he is behind for his age.

""So for him to even shout out I was so proud of him as he has only been able to string a sentence together for the last the year - it shows he's really coming on.""

Vicky said the cinema should hold screenings especially for those with additional needs to avoid similar confrontations from happening.

She said: ""People have been so supportive on social media.

""There have been special needs mums coming forward and they want to do this trip to the cinema, getting all the special-needs mums together.

""It would be lovely, the children could run around the cinema and make noises.

""I know people say you should go to autism-friendly screenings but they're miles away.

""I wanted to get my point across and raise awareness because I found the situation really sad and quite heartless.""

Plenty of parents have voiced support for Vicky on social media and agreed that other members of the public should be more understanding of Noah's autism.

Danielle Chapman commented: ""This is so sad and something I really fear with my son, he's not diagnosed yet but is showing potential early signs of autism.

""Why can't people be understanding.

""Poor little boy my heart really goes out to him and his mum.

""Just because someone is 'different' they still deserve to be apart of society and not be judged.""

Emma Harman added: ""I just find it so hard in today's world we just can't all have some empathy.

""I hope the other mother feels ashamed of herself, she has no right to say keep him at home.""

690,"ROME - Brandenburg has become the first state in Germany to require all children attending kindergarten to be vaccinated for measles and other infectious diseases as fears spread across Europe about the influence of the anti-vaccination movement and lower immunization rates.

A decrease in immunization has led to an increase in measles in Germany, France, Italy and elsewhere.

The German government is considering whether to mandate vaccinations across the country. Authorities there say 2019 is likely to be a record year for measles with cases tripling in three states. Other European countries have already introduced laws making vaccinations compulsory, including Italy which two years ago passed a law making 10 vaccines obligatory for children who enrolled in Italian schools, including chickenpox and measles.

Last week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency with 285 cases of measles confirmed since October. City health officials have ordered mandatory vaccinations for anybody who’s been in contact with infected people and violators can face fines of up to $1,000.

Health officials say a booklet produced by an anti-vaccine group has been widely disseminated through Orthodox Jewish communities, not the first time in the United States an insular community has seen a jump in infection rates as a result of a fall in immunization rates prompted by anti-vaccine campaigners.

Under the Brandenburg law children who have not been vaccinated against measles will be excluded from attending kindergartens. Brandenburg lawmakers say they will examine whether to add other vaccinations. “In the public interest, individual concerns towards vaccination, which cannot be proven scientifically, must take second place,” said Sylvia Lehmann of the Social Democratic Party.

State lawmakers from Germany's right-wing populist Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) voted against the legislation, noting a vaccine obligation last existed in east Germany when the communists were in power. The Green Party abstained from the vaccine vote.

Brandenburg’s health minister Andreas Buttner says “the protection of babies and pregnant women” should take “precedence over the rights of those who refuse to have their children vaccinated.” In Brandenburg 73.5% of young children are being vaccinated within the recommended time frame of 23 months.

In some Germany’s other states, including Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, school principals have been taking action by ordering children who have not been vaccinated to go home.

The World Health Organization said more Europeans contracted measles last year – 82,600 – than at any time in the past decade.

German Health Minister Hermann Groehe is proposing a federal law obligating nursery schools in all of the country’s 16 states to report parents to health officials if they cannot prove that they sought vaccination advice for their children. If the law is passed, parents who do not show proof of such medical consultation could be fined up to $2,800.

“No one can be blasé about the fact that people are still dying of measles,” Groehe told Germany’s Bild newspaper. “Therefore we are now toughening the regulations for vaccination protection.”

But Groehe has so far ruled out making vaccinations compulsory for school children, as Italy recently did.

Italy’s approach has been characterized by U-turns, thanks to the vaccine-sceptic anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), which is in a coalition government with the populist Lega party.

M5S had helped to fuel the anti-vaccination campaign and poured scorn on expert opinion that insists vaccines are safe and the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine isn’t linked to autism. The party argued requiring schoolchildren to be vaccinated was “coercive.”

Last year, the health minister, a member of the Five Star Movement, introduced a temporary measure to allow children to stay in school as long as their parents declared they had been vaccinated without having to provide any documentation. Italian measles rates then skyrocketed and last year the country accounted for nearly a quarter of all new cases in Europe, according to WHO.

The organization says 95% of a population needs to be inoculated for the spread of the disease to become unlikely, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated for serious health reasons, including lowered immunity.

In March, the Italian government allowed the M5S's temporary measure relaxing vaccination rules to expire, bringing back into play a two-year-old law requiring children to receive mandatory immunizations before attending school.

Analysts say there has been a noticeable shift in public opinion favoring vaccinations since an Italian populist politician who has campaigned against compulsory vaccinations was hospitalized last month after contracting chickenpox and was widely mocked on social media.",mainstream
733,"In December, 1962, Esquire magazine established what it called its Dubious Achievement Awards.

These were a series of fictional prizes given to celebrities, politicians, and business leaders who committed some egregious blunder that year, a gaffe worthy of a kind of Hall of Shame.

The annual event became so popular that readers and media hungered for it year after year.

Now there are dubious awards everywhere, across all genres — movies, television, commercials.

Every news organization hungers to win awards. They display them in glass cases in the lobby. They write stories about the individual winners.

Your public broadcaster is no different. We love getting awards. The award season is about to begin, with various programs submitting entries to award-conferring bodies. Over the years, the CBC — radio and television — has received hundreds of plaques, statuettes, proclamations recognizing significant achievements in reporting and broadcasting.

At the tail end of 2016, we received an official looking envelope containing an official, suitable-for-framing, award certificate. Because of its importance, I want to read the official proclamation word for word:

To wit - ""The 2016 Adding Insult to Injury Award, recognizing deception, distortion and dishonesty in Media, awarded to CBC Radio — The Sunday Edition.""

The award was presented by the Board of Directors of Vaccine Choice Canada.

For those unaware of Vaccine Choice Canada, it is an organization opposed to the compulsory vaccination of children.

Its argument is that ordinary vaccinations can neurologically wound children or kill them outright. It blames vaccination for seeming increases in autism spectrum disorder.

It assiduously ignores the burden of evidence from the World Health Organization at the top of the health chain, down to your local family physician and pharmacist, that this is not the case.

Measles is one of the most contagious and deadly diseases on the planet. It kills about 100,000 children every year.

What Vaccine Choice Canada objects to is a story we broadcast on last June on the backfire effect.

I interviewed an American professor named Brendan Nyhan. He explained the backfire effect as the inability of many people to change their opinions, even after presented with irrefutable facts to the contrary.

It matters not how many facts are marshalled to contradict them. They are resolute, even reinforced, in their views.

During the interview, Professor Nyhan used the anti-vaccine movement as another example of the intransigence of people holding views which are contradicted by evidence.

With the anti-vaccine movement, it is especially difficult. As the New York Times pointed out in early January, the anti-vaccine group ""is not a bastion of rationality.""

Although study after study has demonstrated there is no link between vaccination and such diseases as autism, the anti-vaxxers continue their crusade.

You have to be an automaton not to feel sorry for parents dealing with autism, who search for some explanation for their child's disorder. In desperation they turn to garbage science and conspiracy theories.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a 21 page document listing all the studies showing that there is no link between vaccines and autism.

Nevertheless, the arguments put out by the anti-vaxxers seems to be gaining ground in the United State, especially in the south and especially in Texas.

Peter Hotez is a pediatrician with the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Dr. Hotez, writing in the New York Times, said that because the number of unvaccinated children is rising, there could be serious outbreaks of measles in his state.

It doesn't help things when the sitting president believes that vaccines cause autism.

Dr. Hotez said: ""I'm worried that our nation's health will soon be threatened because we have not stood up to the pseudoscience and fake conspiracy claims of this movement.""

In 2000, the US Centres for Disease Control announced that measles had been eliminated in the United States, meaning it was no longer endemic to the US.

Now it appears to be coming back. Which means a renewed attention on the importance of vaccination and the skeptics who oppose it.

So on behalf of The Sunday Edition, I humbly accept the 2016 Adding Insult to Injury Award, and give it pride of place in our office.

791,"The Health Secretary has said he hopes everyone in the country would be immunised against coronavirus if the UK develops a vaccine. Matt Hancock stopped short of confirming jab would be mandatory when asked at today’s Downing Street press conference, but he didn’t rule it out either. A working vaccination is yet to be developed anywhere in the world, but scientists at Oxford University and Imperial College London are locked in a race to make one. Speaking to reporters the Health Secretary said: ‘The question of whether it’s mandatory is not one that we’ve addressed yet. We are still some time off a vaccine being available. But I would hope, given the scale of this crisis, and given the overwhelming need for us to get through this and to get the country back on its feet, and the very positive impact that a vaccine would have, that everybody would have the vaccine.’ National coordinator of the UK’s testing effort Professor John Newton said mandatory vaccinations are an option, but that hopefully it won’t come to that. He added: ‘The most successful vaccine programmes tend to be via consent, so what really matters is clear explanation of the benefits and any risks associated with the vaccine, and a really good system to make the vaccine available to anybody who needs it.

‘Although some countries have adopted mandatory programmes the most successful programmes tend to be on the basis of consent, good information and good delivery mechanisms. But clearly mandation is there and can be used in some instances.’

961,"The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at H.H.S. is distributing billions of dollars to companies to develop vaccines, including the latest funding to AstraZeneca. The authority, known as Barda, has already agreed to provide up to $483 million to the biotech company Moderna and $500 million to Johnson & Johnson for their separate vaccine efforts. It has also agreed to provide $30 million to a coronavirus vaccine effort by the French company Sanofi, building on a larger contract announced last December for making flu inoculations.

Scores of vaccine efforts are underway around the world, and several potential vaccines are now in at least small-scale clinical trials. But the Oxford vaccine candidate, now licensed by AstraZeneca, has moved quickly into the kind of large-scale testing necessary to prove safety and effectiveness.

Building on efforts to develop a vaccine against a similar disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the Oxford scientists last month began a Phase I trial of their potential vaccine against Covid-19 in Britain involving 1,100 participants. A combined Phase II and Phase III trial involving 5,000 participants is set to begin in Britain by the end of this month.

The researchers have said that if the vaccine is proven effective, they hope to have an approval for emergency use, worldwide, by September. But a steep decline in the rate of new infections in Britain may make it difficult to prove effectiveness. Ethics rules generally preclude deliberately infecting test participants. That means unless enough test participants who are given a placebo become infected with the virus in the community, the researchers cannot show that the potential vaccine does its job.

The large-scale tests in the United States this summer may provide another opportunity.

On Monday, Moderna announced partial data of its first-phase trial, saying its vaccine candidate had proven safe and that it had provoked an immune response in 45 people, including eight who had extensive tests that found they had produced antibodies that could prevent the virus from infecting cells. It is also working on an accelerated timetable with partners at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Swiss company Lonza. Moderna received approval to move to a second phase involving 600 people and said it would also begin a third stage in July with thousands of healthy people.

The Trump administration’s efforts to stanch the pandemic have been troubled by a series of agency fumbles, starting with defective C.D.C. tests that stalled detection of the virus’s spread for weeks and limited diagnoses for patients at hospitals and clinics.

Recently, President Trump reorganized vaccine and treatment efforts after he dismissed last month the head of Barda, Rick Bright, who then filed a whistle-blower complaint contending he had been pressured to seek approval for certain treatments for Covid-19. Just last week, Mr. Trump named Moncef Slaoui, a venture capitalist who was a longtime vaccine executive at GlaxoSmithKline and most recently a board member for Moderna, to help oversee “Operation Warp Speed,” the federal drive to accelerate ways to combat the virus.",mainstream

• A licensed New York pediatrician named Lawrence Palevsky has spread misinformation about the safety of vaccines for years.
• Palevsky has ramped up his efforts amid outbreaks of measles largely driven by misleading anti-vaccine rhetoric.
• Doctors like Palevsky are prompting some in the medical community to question whether physicians should lose their license for expressing anti-vaccine views.
• Legal experts say revoking a doctor's license for expressing an opinion would be unprecedented.

On May 13, hundreds of parents packed into a catering hall in Monsey, New York, for an event billed as a ""Vaccine Symposium."" Monsey is a hamlet in Rockland County, which is struggling to contain an unprecedented outbreak of measles. But the event's organizers weren't there to educate the crowd on how vaccines can halt the spread of the illness, which can be fatal. They were there to promote a pernicious and discredited message that health officials have blamed for the outbreak: that vaccines endanger young children.

Hardly any of the symposium's speakers, which included a YouTube host and a Washington lobbyist, practice medicine. The exception was a 57-year-old pediatrician named Lawrence Palevsky, who sees patients in Manhattan and the nearby Suffolk County on Long Island. His clinic's website promises ""personalized, comprehensive consultations"" to address ""children's wellness, and acute and chronic illnesses.""

""Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of mothers … have witnessed children regressing after they get the MMR,"" Palevsky told the crowd, largely composed of members of Rockland's Orthodox Jewish community, according to a Gothamist reporter who attended the event. (""MMR"" refers to the combined vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella.) He reportedly added: ""Children stop talking, they don't look at you, they start flapping their arms, they start banging their head.""

As a doctor, Palevsky pledged his loyalty to the medical profession and promised not to harm patients. Yet for at least a decade, he has delivered lectures, attended local meetups, and given interviews in which he has publicly opposed the mandatory vaccination of minors and linked certain vaccines to disorders like regressive autism. In April, The New York Times described Palevsky as an ""anti-vaccine proponent,"" while NBC News called him ""a star in the anti-vaccine world.""

Figures like Palevsky are drawing audiences, and provoking alarm, in the midst of a public health crisis fueled almost exclusively by the failure of some parents to vaccinate their children. Their efforts have revived a long-standing debate in the medical and legal establishments over whether doctors who spread falsehoods about vaccines should be seen as violating standards of professional conduct.

Palevsky's anti-vaccine views have drawn the ire of the medical establishment

Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at New York University's School of Medicine, said Palevsky's conduct was incompatible with his role as a healthcare provider. ""I absolutely believe New York state should revoke Palevsky's license, because he's advocating breaking the standard of care and spreading misinformation, putting children and the public at risk,"" he told INSIDER. ""It's especially important in an outbreak, which could turn into a full-bore epidemic.""

""There are standards of care created by medicine, created by pediatricians, by experts,"" he added. ""If you violate those, you should lose your license.""

Palevsky is neither the first nor the most famous doctor to criticize vaccines. Elements of the modern anti-vaccine movement can be traced to a British doctor named Andrew Wakefield, who lost his medical license over a discredited study that linked the MMR vaccine to autism. (He appeared at the symposium in Monsey via video conference.) And Rand Paul, the ophthalmologist serving as the junior US senator from Kentucky, denounced mandatory vaccination as recently as this March, citing personal-liberty concerns.

But few licensed, practicing physicians have aligned themselves with the anti-vaccination movement in the way Palevsky has. The Vaccine Safety Handbook, an infamous and error-laden anti-vaccine brochure anonymously distributed throughout New York City — and seemingly targeted at Orthodox Jewish parents — instructs readers to call a Manhattan phone number to listen to an ""interview with pediatrician Lawrence Palevsky, M.D., including what he learned in medical school about vaccines.""

Palevsky's résumé makes him particularly valuable to the anti-vaccine movement, which has long sought mainstream legitimacy. After graduating from New York University's School of Medicine in 1987, he worked and taught at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Lenox Hill Hospital, and New York Medical College. If you didn't know about his anti-vaccine beliefs, you would be forgiven for thinking Palevsky was merely an accomplished pediatrician.

There are, however, certain discrepancies in his professional history. The website of Palevsky's clinic repeatedly describes him as a ""board certified pediatrician."" That status is conferred by the American Board of Pediatrics, which continually tests pediatricians to ensure they have up-to-date training and expertise in the field. But a representative for the board told INSIDER that Palevsky's most recent certification expired at the end of 2014.

A physician database maintained by New York state indicates Palevsky has admission privileges at two hospitals affiliated with the well-regarded Mount Sinai Health System, Beth Israel, and St. Luke's. While the database shows Palevsky's entry was last updated in March 2018 and is ""based on the information supplied by the physician who is the subject of the data,"" the hospital said it was inaccurate. ""Dr. Palevsky had not been affiliated with Mount Sinai since the late '90s,"" a spokeswoman, Lucia L. Lee, said. ""The site that you referenced is clearly out of date.""

It would be difficult, and probably unprecedented, to strip a doctor of a medical license solely for expressing anti-vaccine views

It may seem like a no-brainer to revoke the license of a physician who regularly spreads false, discredited information that, if relied on, could result in preventable injury or death. But state health departments, which license doctors and regulate the medical industry, have traditionally drawn a bright line between what doctors say in public and how they treat their patients. Regulators monitor what happens in the exam room or surgical theater, but they leave doctors free to speak their minds everywhere else.

This explains why, in 2015, the Arizona Board of Osteopathic Examiners declined to take action against the cardiologist Jack Wolfson over a series of interviews in which he argued that children had a ""right"" to contract the measles, mumps, rubella, and chicken pox without the interference of vaccines. Nearly 40 people filed complaints against Wolfson in 2015, but in a 4-1 vote, the board held that he had a First Amendment right to speak his mind about vaccines and that ""no complaints have been filed by patients"" regarding Wolfson's ""actual medical care.""

In 2013, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals expressed a comparable distinction in its decision to uphold a California law barring licensed therapists from practicing conversion therapy on LGBTQ minors: ""Outside the doctor-patient relationship, doctors are constitutionally equivalent to soapbox orators and pamphleteers, and their speech receives robust protection under the First Amendment.""

The most prominent example of a health board sanctioning a vaccine critic was ultimately about record-keeping, not the content of the critic's views. In 2018, the Medical Board of California sought to revoke the license of Bob Sears, who advises parents that ""you can safely raise an unvaccinated child in today's society,"" for failing to take a detailed medical history and maintain proper records when he wrote a letter exempting a 2-year-old patient from vaccinations. (California requires a doctor's note to avoid vaccines; the board stayed its decision pending the completion of probation and continuing education classes.)

In a statement to INSIDER, the New York State Department of Health was careful to distinguish between Palevsky's public statements, which it regards as beyond its purview, and his patient care.

While ""the New York State Department of Health will continue our extensive public outreach campaign to educate people on the facts about vaccinations and to counter misinformation that has fueled this outbreak,"" the department spokeswoman Jill Montag said, ""the First Amendment protects an individual's right to speak and express opinions about controversial topics without fear of government retaliation. Matters involving specific patients in the practice of medicine may, however, become the subject of an investigation.""

Asked whether Palevsky was the subject of such an investigation, Montag responded: ""The Department cannot confirm or deny the existence of a [misconduct] investigation of a physician, unless charges are served upon the physician, or a public action is taken by the Board.""

Eugene Volokh, a constitutional-law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has studied how states wield occupational licenses to punish certain forms of speech, argues that, in the absence of evidence that any specific patients are being harmed, Palevsky should be free to spout unscientific nonsense. That freedom, he says, is an integral part of the scientific process.

""This is an important First Amendment protection,"" Volokh told INSIDER. ""How do we know that a consensus on scientific questions such as this is right? Precisely because we know that scientists, doctors, and others are free to challenge that consensus, and that other scientists and doctors have heard those challenges and continue to reject them. Whenever the government coerces people to stop critiquing this sort of established opinion, that undermines the very foundation for that opinion.""

Caplan, the NYU professor, disagreed. ""The science is rock solid,"" he said. ""It's not something that's being bolstered because there is a constant challenge. The only people who are challenging it are fringe individuals who are nonscientists.""",mainstream
392,"Willcocks LC et al. (2007) The effect of sirolimus therapy on vaccine responses in transplant recipients. Am J Transplant 7: 2006–2011

Immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil can reduce the protective antibody response to vaccination in transplant recipients, putting these patients at high risk of infections and complications. Few data are available regarding the effect of sirolimus on vaccination response. Willcocks et al. investigated immune responses to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations in 9 hepatic and 23 renal transplant recipients who had been randomized to either continue on a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI; tacrolimus or ciclosporin; n = 17) or switch to sirolimus (n = 15) at least 3 months after transplantation.

All patients received—from the same batches—an influenza vaccine and, 4 weeks later, a pneumococcal vaccine.

Four weeks after influenza vaccination, mean titers of antibodies against all three influenza antigens tested had increased significantly in both patient groups (P <0.0005) and there were no significant differences in increases between groups. Nevertheless, all sirolimus-treated patients mounted an antibody response against at least one influenza antigen that was deemed to be protective, compared with only 75% of CNI-treated patients (P = 0.038). Eight weeks after pneumococcal vaccination, the mean antibody levels for 6 of the 7 pneumococcus serotypes measured had increased significantly in patients in both groups (P <0.05); no significant differences in pneumococcus antibody levels or changes in antibody levels were observed between groups.

Transplant type, serum creatinine level and number of immunosuppressant agents had no effect on response to either vaccine. Vaccination guidelines for transplant recipients on CNIs are, therefore, likely to also be suitable for those on sirolimus.",mainstream
890,"Who should get a ventilator if there aren’t enough to go around? Research on decision making leads to three concrete guidelines that policy-makers and physicians can use to make fair choices when allocating scarce, life-saving resources. They key to making fair and ethical choices is to assure that decisions are made through an impartial process.

Physicians around the world must make daunting decisions in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. Chief among their concerns is that there might not be enough of a scarce resource, such as ventilators, ICU beds, or vaccines, for all of the patients who need them. This isn’t a theoretical dilemma. Doctors in Italy faced horrifying choices about which patients should get a ventilator and which they should let die. Fortunately, major U.S. cities have thus far escaped that calamity, but this remains an important concern for the months ahead as we wait to see whether the virus slows down or resurges.

Globally, the situation remains challenging as the virus spreads to regions with fewer resources. Confronted with impossible choices, hospitals need workable guidelines that reflect society’s deepest understanding of fairness. Research on moral decision making, and our own experiments asking ordinary people what choices they would make, offers some guidance.

Who should get a ventilator if there aren’t enough to go around? Many medical ethicists adopt a philosophical perspective called utilitarianism. The idea is simple – you should seek to minimize overall harm and maximize well-being across society. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, for instance, bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel and colleagues argue for prioritizing the lives of health care providers – providing them first with testing, ventilators, treatments and vaccines – to assure that they can remain on the job or return quickly to it if they become sick. “These workers should be given priority not because they are somehow more worthy,” they write, “but because of their instrumental value: they are essential to pandemic response.” Utilitarianism likewise endorses the traditional “triage” of battlefield medicine, where resources are directed toward those whose lives hang in the balance and away from those who will surely live or surely die.

Yet, utilitarianism’s willingness to confront seemingly impossible choices head on makes many people uncomfortable. Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for example, announced that there would be investigations of those who institute utilitarian policies during the crisis. But, Severino failed to provide any alternative guidance for making such tragic choices.

One especially controversial feature of utilitarianism is that in life-or-death decisions it favors the young over the old, because doing so can be expected to save more years of life. But when ventilators are scarce, isn’t it immoral to explicitly favor the young?

To shed light on the question of whether hospitals should take a utilitarian perspective in these challenging times we set out to understand the perspectives of American citizens about how they would want physicians to prioritize care. In a recent experiment, we instructed one group of participants to imagine a doctor deciding whether to give the last available ventilator to the 65-year-old patient who arrived first or to the 25-year-old patient who arrived moments later. Participants were told to assume that whichever patient is saved will live to age 80, and that the ventilator is equally capable of saving either patient. About half of these participants thought that it would be moral to give the ventilator to the younger person. Perhaps not surprisingly, their answers were strongly associated with their age; 66% of people between 18 and 30 considered it moral to give the ventilator to the younger person, but only 33% of people 60 or older agreed.

But we saw an interesting shift when we asked participants to look at this dilemma from an impartial stance. Applying philosopher John Rawls’ veil of ignorance perspective, which argues that a fair decision is equivalent to a selfish decision, provided that you don’t know who you will be among those affected, we presented another group of participants with the same situation. However, we first asked them to put themselves into the equation, imagining that they had a 50% chance of being the older patient, with 15 years left to live if saved, and a 50% chance of being the younger patient, who will live 55 years if saved. About three quarters said they would want the doctor to follow the utilitarian principle, favoring the younger patient.

More interestingly, after thinking through what they would want under the veil of not knowing whether they were the younger or older patient, when we then asked whether they thought that it would be moral to give the ventilator to the younger person, a much higher percentage (62%) now found the utilitarian course of action more ethical. This increase in the proportion of people favoring the younger patient occurred principally because most of the older respondents, imagining themselves with an equal chance of being young or old, now chose to save the younger patient. The change in moral assessment when the veil of ignorance obscured which patient they were — young or old — was strongest for those over 60.

Their preferences tell us something about fairness principles. “First come, first served” is a morally plausible principle. So is “Save the most years of life.” Which rule is fairer in the current moment? When participants put themselves in the shoes of both patients, the majority indicated that saving more life-years is fairer: It’s what they would want for themselves if they did not know whom they were going to be.

Our most important conclusion is not that the young should be favored over the old, or that any group should be favored over any other, but rather that decisions should be made through an impartial process. Research on decision making provides three concrete guidelines that policymakers and physicians can use to make fair choices when allocating scarce, life-saving resources:

First, it can be helpful to try to use Rawls’ veil of ignorance. Our current work applied Rawls’ idea and found that assuming a veil of ignorance shifts judgment toward saving more life years. We’ve seen this same effect in previous research that looked at people’s instinct to save the most lives in scenarios involving self-driving cars, charitable giving, and health care decisions.

Second, decisions can be improved when making comparative rather than one-off choices. Our research (with Iris Bohnet and Alexandra van Geen) shows that when people evaluate job candidates one at a time, they make stereotype-based decisions, such as hiring men for mathematical tasks and women for verbal tasks. By contrast, when people compare two applicants at the same time, they focus more on job-relevant criteria and make more ethical, less sexist hiring choices. In other research (with Chia-Jung Tsay and Fiery Cushman), we found that considering two moral dilemmas at the same time promotes consistency in moral decision-making. Similarly, comparing multiple options for saving lives when resources are limited should lead to better, more ethical decisions than evaluating options one at a time. Thus, rather than make case-by-case decisions when patients in critical need arrive at a hospital, doctors should consider multiple options or policies for how they would allocate limited resources.

Third, it’s important to pre-commit to evaluative standards. Our ongoing research (with Linda Chang, Mina Cikara, and Iris Bohnet) shows that that when employers first think through the criteria that define a good employee before considering a specific candidate, they make less discriminatory decisions and hire better-quality employees. Likewise, when physicians and administrators think through their goals when planning how to allocate limited medical resources, they will reach decisions that are more aligned with their values.

Just as surgeons aim to use the best available tools when operating, those at the front lines of the pandemic need the best decision-making tools available to allocate scarce resources fairly. That means moving beyond intuitive thinking, harnessing their deliberative cognitive capacities — and empowering them to make these tragic decisions as ethically as possible.",mainstream
1193,"CHOLERA is the potentially deadly condition caused by drinking dirty water or eating contaminated food.

Here's all you need to know about the bacterial infection caused by poor sanitation.

Cholera is a bacterial infection of the small intestine that is spread through dirty water and food that has been contaminated with an infected person's faeces.

Once infected, people start to experience symptoms of the disease within a few days and if left untreated - it can prove fatal.

Cholera is most widespread in places across the globe where there is poor sanitation such as sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia, the Middle East and the Caribbean and Central America.

There also tends to be outbreaks after natural disasters or during a humanitarian crisis, where people are forced to live in cramped conditions with little access to clean drinking water.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that up to four million people are infected every year, with it killing up to 143,000.

However, there have not been any cases of cholera that have originated in England and Wales for over 100 years.

A public health emergency was declared in Zimbabwe in September 2018 after a cholera outbreak killed at least 20 people and 2,000 others have been infected.

Health minister Obadiah Moyo blamed the outbreak on burst sewers which contaminated drinking wells and boreholes.

What are the symptoms of cholera?

As the cholera infection attacks the small intestine, one of the most common symptoms of the condition is severe, watery, diarrhoea.

It can also cause nausea and vomiting and people also complain of experiencing stomach cramps.

It can take between 12 hours and 5 days for a person to show symptoms after ingesting contaminated food or water.

If at this point the disease isn't treated, the symptoms will get worse and a person can become severely dehydrated very quickly.

Once this happens, there can also be a sudden drop in blood pressure, which can prove fatal if the major organs begin to shut down.



What is the treatment for cholera?

Despite the condition being potentially fatal, cholera is easily treatable.

The most common treatment for cholera patients is an oral rehydration solution, which can prevent a person becoming too dehydrated.

The solution comes in the form of a sachet of a mixture of salt and glucose, which is mixed with clean water.

The patient then drinks the solution and it replaces any fluids a person has lost through sickness and diarrhoea.

Sachets are easily available from shops and if travelling to affected areas, experts advise taking them with you.

If a person is severely dehydrated, intravenous saline drips and antibiotics may be prescribed to speed up recovery.

Is there a vaccine against cholera?

There is a vaccine against cholera, although it is not usually given as hygiene precautions are usually enough to prevent the infection.

However, the vaccine is given to people such as aid workers and armed forces, who may have to travel to areas where there is a cholera outbreak.

The vaccine is given in the form of a liquid, where it is mixed with water and then taken orally.

For everyone over the age of six, two doses of the vaccine should be given six weeks apart and at least one week before travelling to an infected area.

The vaccine cannot be given to those under the age of two, pregnant or breastfeeding women or people with an immune system condition.

It is thought to be about 85 per cent effective and the level of protection reduces over time, meaning boosters are sometimes required.

Are there any other ways to prevent cholera?

The WHO is working to reduce the number of cholera cases by closely monitoring water sources for signs of the infection.

They are also putting in place the development of piped water supplies and safe sewage disposal in countries where there is poor sanitation.

For travellers, the NHS has issued advice on what they can do to prevent cholera as well as travellers' diarrhoea.
• Only drinking water that is from a bottle that has been sealed or recently boiled
• Avoiding ice cream and having ice in drinks",mainstream
51,"More than 100 genes tied to autism identified in large study

More than 100 genes associated with autism were identified in a ""landmark study"" that could help better understand what causes the disability, researchers say.

In the large genetic-sequencing study, a team of researchers led by scientists at Mount Sinai and relying on international collaboration identified the 102 genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

The team relied on samples from more than 35,000 participants, of which almost 12,000 had autism, and they were able to study both genes that were inherited and those that occurred when egg or sperm are formed.

Of the 102 genes, 49 were also tied with other development delays, the researchers say.

""With these identified genes we can begin to understand what brain changes underlie ASD and begin to consider novel treatment approaches,"" Joseph Buxbaum, the director of the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, said in a statement.

The study was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal Cell.

In 2015, only 65 genes associated with ASD were known, the researchers say. Dr. Andrew Adesman, the chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York, said the study is the latest in a string of advances to help understand the genetic factors associated with autism in some children.

""Identification of these new genes associated with autism may not only help pinpoint a likely cause for ASD in some children, but it will also help researchers better determine the biological mechanisms that underlie autism,"" he wrote in an email to USA TODAY. Adesman was not involved in the study.

Autism and vaccines: Vaccines are definitely not linked to autism, and other facts you can throw at anti-vaxers

Autism spectrum disorder affects communication and behavior, and its effects usually appear early in life, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.

The condition is known as a spectrum disorder because an array of behaviors and their severity may vary depending on the individual, the institute says.

Reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers are among some of the traits seen in early infancy, according to the Mayo Clinic. Some children later become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills, the hospital says.

About 1 in 59 children has been identified with ASD, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Adesman said the research is encouraging because with genetic testing, the findings increase the likelihood of determining a probable genetic cause for some children's autism. Still, Adesman tempered some exceptions: ""Unfortunately, even though this latest research has newly identified many genes associated with ASD, the reality is that for many affected children, a specific cause may not be identified.""

Among the other findings in the study: No one major class of cells alone are tied to autism, instead, a host of disruptions in brain development and in neuronal function can lead to the condition, Buxbaum said.",mainstream
252,"The preliminary results of a survey being run by the Vaccine Confidence Project — which monitors public trust in vaccination programs worldwide — and ORB International show that between mid-March and mid-April of this year, one fifth of Swiss respondents and 18 percent of those in France would refuse a coronavirus vaccine. Among Austrians, the number is 16 percent, and 9 percent in Germany.

While this may not be enough to block efforts to reach so-called herd immunity — estimated at 60 to 70 percent — European governments know only too well how vaccine skepticism can derail national vaccination plans, as recent controversies have shown.

On one hand, a vaccine has to come when the risk of infection is still high, but if it comes too soon, people may not trust that it's safe.

German Health Minister Jens Spahn earlier this month rejected the idea that a future vaccine may be made mandatory in the country, saying a majority of people would want to get vaccinated as soon as it became available.

That does not include the world's top-ranked tennis player Novak Djokovic, who opposes vaccination and said he would have to make a decision if traveling to tournaments becomes contingent on getting vaccinated, according to the Guardian.

When it comes to other people's readiness for it, timing is of the essence, said Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project.

“If they see there is still a threat — the second wave perhaps — they’re going to be more open to it,” she said. But if that appears to be waning, they may not want to take the risk of a new vaccine that we don’t know enough about, she noted.

In the U.K., 7 percent of those surveyed — representative of the country's population, according to Larson — said in mid-March they would refuse to be vaccinated against coronavirus. When the number of deaths rose two weeks later, that figure dropped to 5 percent. ""Now that they see the numbers are coming down, it goes up to 9 percent saying they would refuse,"" Larson said.

Marco Cavaleri, head of Biological Health Threats and Vaccines Strategy at the European Medicines Agency, is well aware of the dilemma facing decision-makers in rushing out a vaccine and making sure it's safe.

“We have to be sure that this trade-off is not compromising the certainty that we need to have around the safety of the vaccine,” he told reporters Thursday. For that, the EU’s drug regulator has to work with vaccine developers to understand what kind of evidence they can provide in the shortest possible time, while giving sufficient reassurance that these vaccines are safe and effective, he said.

But that will not be enough to convince Marie Werbrègue, president of the anti-vax group Info Vaccins France.

She would refuse and advise against any vaccine that is developed because “I know it would not work, that it would be dangerous and not tested at all,” she said, claiming that some vaccine trials skipped completing animal tests before being given to people.

Werbrègue doesn’t believe the world is going through a pandemic.

“It’s a type of flu, like the others,” she said, adding that numbers are manipulated to scare people for political and financial purposes.

Social media is rife with theories that international groups created the virus to get people vaccinated, implicating the World Health Organization and Bill Gates as the main suspects, given the substantial funding the latter’s foundation provides to the former.

""It's confounding when you see that out there,"" Melinda Gates told POLITICO. ""When there's more anxiety, and people have more time on their hands, they want to, you know, attack someone.”

People are more likely to latch onto conspiracy theories when times are uncertain “because they feed into a need of control and psychological certainty, and provide simple answers to complex questions,” said Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge.

But David Salisbury, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s global health program, is not convinced these would deter people from getting vaccinated, because they understand the severity of the virus.

“If their perception of this virus is that it can kill them or make them extraordinarily ill, and the studies to date show the vaccine is safe, I think it would be a foolhardy choice to put yourself and your family at unnecessary risk,” he said.

But conspiracy theory experts are not so sure. Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive psychology professor at the University of Bristol, said there is a clear link between conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers.

“My best guess is that in Europe, most people will be delighted by the availability of the vaccine and will line up to get it so life can return to normal,” Lewandowsky said, but “we cannot be sure until the vaccination arrives on the scene.”

“You're always going to have this kind of alternative thinkers at the edges, and we have them in general, with vaccines,” said Larson at the Vaccine Confidence Project.

But there are also many who don’t believe in conspiracy theories, but have safety concerns and think the decisions about vaccination are top-down, without giving them a say in the matter. “Parents feel like they just want to ask some basic legitimate questions and, you know, they're being either judged or shunned,” she said.

Larson has written a book – called ""Stuck"" — about the issue, expected to be published this summer.

“One of my points is that we don’t have a misinformation problem, we have a relationship problem,” she said. Misinformation can be deleted, but the underlying distrust that has caused it remains, she said.

Italy is one of the countries that has struggled with that and in 2017 introduced a law that increased the number of mandatory vaccines to 10, mainly in response to a measles outbreak. The issue has become highly political, playing out in the last round of elections.

As the country cautiously emerges from the first wave of the pandemic, the debate on mandatory vaccination is certain to be a heated one.

The government is made up of a coalition between the 5Star Movement, which has long led a battle against the obligation to vaccinate, and the center-left Democratic Party, which increased the number of mandatory vaccinations when in power in 2017.

Health ministry officials said Health Minister Roberto Speranza, from the minority left-wing LeU party, is favorable to a legal obligation to vaccinate for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, when a vaccine comes to the market.

Pierpaolo Sileri of the 5Stars, deputy health minister and recovering coronavirus patient, said that he had “no doubt that such a vaccine should be mandatory,” according to La Repubblica.

But not everyone agrees.

Davide Barillari, a regional councilor in Lazio, thinks a vaccine is not the right way to go in this epidemic.

“There is no guarantee that the vaccine is safe and reliable, and the obligation is not the correct solution,” he told POLITICO. “The obligation seems an authoritarian response to a need for security that can be guaranteed in other ways.”

Elected for the 5Stars, Barillari was expelled from the movement in April for launching a website giving information on the coronavirus not endorsed by the party.

Larson warned that how public health authorities act in this pandemic is crucial, not just in stopping it, but in gaining — or further losing — people’s trust.

Since “we’re not going to have the vaccine for a while,” it’s a good time to start consulting with the people on how to go about it, she said.

“Either it could be used as a trust-building [time], or it can add to the litany of historical events where they felt betrayed or left out or excluded, which adds up to some of the contemporary distrust,” she said.

447,"Some of the questions about who gets vaccinated first will be answered by whichever vaccine succeeds first. The Moderna candidate that is racing into Phase II and III trials after promising early data has so far only been studied in people over 18 years old. Without trials in children at some point, it would not be authorized for pediatric use.

Vaccines can sometimes be risky to administer to the elderly and others with weakened immune systems because they might not mount an effective immune response — and some might become sicker if they then got the virus than they would have without the shot. These potential dangers are usually identified during late-stage clinical studies that have not been completed for any experimental coronavirus vaccine.

Even if an eventual vaccine does not pose special risk to older people, it may make more sense to prioritize vaccinating people who interact with the elderly, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

In pandemic fiction like the popular movie ""Contagion,"" the vaccine is the hero, says Offit. But in reality, “it’s never that clean” — especially when candidates are hurtling through trials at a record-breaking speed.

“Because you’re making this in a ‘break the glass’ mentality, you are making it very quickly, you’re going to find things out later that you didn’t know,” Offit said. These include possible safety concerns or how long a vaccine lasts or which groups have the best immune response. “And vaccine confidence in this country, and the world, is already fragile.”

There will most certainly be a need for multiple vaccines, even if Moderna can bring its candidate to market quickly. Dozens of potential vaccines are in the pipeline — many of which are being developed by scientists in China and European countries.

Trump and his officials — including the newly tapped vaccine czar Slaoui, GlaxoSmithKline’s former vaccine chief — have said the government is evaluating 14 candidates. While the president has said a vaccine could be ready before the end of the year, others, such as HHS Secretary Alex Azar, have suggested that would not happen before January 2021.

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has stressed that the government’s timeline assumes everything goes perfectly as manufacturers forge on into increasingly large and complex trials. Unlike the handful of swine flu vaccines in 2009 — built using the foundations developed for annual flu shots — there has never before been a vaccine for any coronavirus.

“It wasn’t easy in 2009 and they had an easier task. You knew all these things that you do not know right now about coronavirus,” said Ostroff.

There have also been notable shifts in vaccine manufacturing since the swine flu epidemic. A central allegation of the anti-vaccination movement is that the preservatives used to make multidose vials work — so that several people can receive a vaccine from the same vial — are dangerous. There is not evidence that that is the case, but manufacturers have drifted away from multidose vials all the same.

Ostroff recalls some days during the swine flu outbreak where the multidose options were all that was available — and people against vaccinations refused to get them.",mainstream
1010,"Research that further debunks any link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been published.

The new reassurrance comes as countries such as Britain and the United States are experiencing a surge in measles cases as parents leave their children unvaccinated.

Years of research with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, better known as MMR, have concluded that it does not cause autism.

Still, some parents' fears persist, in part because of one 1998 study that linked the vaccine with a subgroup of autistic children who also have serious gastrointestinal problems.

Now researchers have at last rigorously replicated the study by Dr Andrew Wakefield, then of the Royal Free Hospital, that caused the furore, by taking samples of youngsters' intestines to hunt for signs of virus with the latest genetic technology.

There is no evidence that MMR plays any role, concludes the international team - which included some of the researchers who first raised the issue in The Lancet.

""We are confident there is no link between MMR and autism,"" said Prof Ian Lipkin of Columbia University New York, who led the work, published in PLoS One.

No one knows just how many autism patients also suffer gastrointestinal disorders but by some estimates, up to a quarter may be affected. The fear about MMR was that the vaccine's weakened measles virus somehow inflamed intestines, allowing waste products to escape and reach the central nervous system, Prof Lipkin said.

So his team had two questions: Does measles virus really persist in children with both disorders and not other youngsters? And did vaccination precede the gastro intestinal complaints which in turn preceded autism?

The team studied 25 children with both autism and gut disorders, and another 13 children with the same disorders but no neurological problems. The children - the average age was five - all were undergoing colonoscopies for their conditions anyway, allowing tissue samples to be tested for genetic traces of measles virus. All had been vaccinated at younger ages.

The samples were analysed in three laboratories that were not told which came from the children with autism. One of the labs had been involved in the original study suggesting a link between measles virus and autism. ""We found no difference in children who had GI complaints and no autism and children who had autism but no GI complaints,"" said Prof Lipkin.

""We found no relationship between the timing of MMR vaccine and the onset of either GI complaints or autism,"" added first author Dr Mady Hornig, also of Columbia.

Dr Larry Pickering of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta added: ""I feel very certain that it is a safe vaccine.""

Growing fears of an epidemic of measles, which can be fatal, prompted the UK government to launch a campaign a few weeks ago to try to make sure that every child in England is given the MMR vaccine, since around three million children aged 18 months to 18 years have missed either their first or second MMR vaccination. .",mainstream
1127,"Roman Catholic Melinda Gates in an interview on TODAY Show pushing hard for a global COVID-19 vaccine was wearing a bright and shiny upside-down cross around her neck.

Symbolism is very important to groups like the Illuminati, the New World Order and others, as they love to flash you signs of how much smarter they are than you and I are. They like to put their true agenda right in our faces, and dare us to figure it out. All this brings us to an interview the TODAY Show did with Melinda Gates back on November 8th, where we see Melinda wearing an upside-down, or inverted, cross around her neck. Who likes to wear inverted crosses? Satanists, pagans, witches, warlocks, New Agers, most people in Hollywood…you get the idea.

“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:” Galatians 3:13 (KJB)

The early First Century Christians never used the cross as a sign or symbol for anything, why? Because it was the instrument of the torturous death of Jesus of Nazareth. The cross as iconic symbolism would not appear until biblical Christianity was hijacked by the Romans around 325 A.D. From that point on you see crosses on everything as Rome infused paganism with Christianity. The bible tells us that the cross is the sign of a curse, and cursed people hang on them. No one in their right minds who believed the bible would want the sign of a curse hanging around their own necks, much less wearing an upside-down cross like the pagans do.

I will let you make up your own mind as to why Melinda Gates chose to wear an upside-down cross on national television. I know she went to Catholic school, and that she and Bill have raised their children as Catholics. But when you look at the millions of dollars they give to Planned Parenthood an organization that exists to slaughter children in the womb, exactly what kind of Catholic she is gets a little murky, to say the least.

The Roman Catholic Church, what I like to call counterfeit Christianity, loves weird occult and pagan symbolism. Over the years we’ve shown you the Vatican Audience Hall that is shaped exactly like a giant snake and has the freakiest, most nastiest statue right behind here the pope sits. Occult symbolism pervades the Vatican to a very high degree. Melinda Gates is a Catholic, you do the math.

Melinda Gates on pandemic: ‘We haven’t had leadership at the national level … it’s chaos’

FROM TODAY: As part of our coronavirus series The Search for Solutions, TODAY’s Savannah Guthrie spoke exclusively to Melinda Gates, who is working to address the pandemic through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. She says there are “a few good candidates” for a vaccine and that the U.S. needs “to start looking at a paid medical leave policy” to help workers on the front lines. She also criticizes the Trump administration for its response to the crisis: “We haven’t had leadership at the national level … it’s chaos.” READ MORE",conspiracy
881,"This week, Maine’s Senate voted 18-17 to remove religious exemptions from the state’s school vaccination law. Supporters of the bill argued it was necessary because religious exemptions put others at risk.

If Gov. Janet Mills (D) signs it into law, Maine will become the fourth state (following California, Mississippi and West Virginia) to ban all non-medical exemptions.

“Tuesday’s vote followed an impassioned debate by opponents, who said ending the religious exemption, as well as a philosophical exemption, would send thousands of families packing while doing little to improve public health or protect children from preventable diseases. The mostly party-line vote, with Republicans in opposition and Democrats favoring the change, saw three Democrats join Republicans in a failed effort to preserve the religious exemption. But one Democrat who supported the exemption in a vote last week changed his position Tuesday, altering the results.”1

Maine has one of the lowest vaccination rates among children entering kindergarten in the nation; for the 2018-19 school year, 5.6 percent of Maine children entering kindergarten had non-medical exemptions.

Sen. James Dill, D-Old Town, a scientist who works for the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, said he was willing to change his position on the bill because he believed expanding categories of medical exemptions would satisfy most of the concerns he and many others had with the immunization requirements and schedule. However, that didn’t work out too well in California.

He did say however that “There needs to be more testing of newborns for known genetic or other disorders, which may cause problems, which people then may link to vaccination. The tests all need to be covered by insurance.”1 (Also that spacing of vaccines, per child, was appropriate.)

“Opponents of the bill said the relatively small number of people taking a religious exemption in Maine has had no statistical impact on increased exposure to preventable diseases. Sen. David Miramant, D-Camden said many parents have obtained only partial exemptions and do vaccinate their children, although they may opt out of some of the vaccines or place their children on a schedule that is not compliant with the state’s regulation. Miramant contended that 97 to 98 percent of students in Maine were receiving all or some of their vaccines. ‘We are in a range that should satisfy you and should not have you wanting to take away the choice of the people,’ he said.”1

But in an erosion of religious freedom and a direct attack on parental rights, the religious right to choose is now gone.

Sen. Brad Farrin, R-Skowhegan, said, “Fundamentally, this vote isn’t about public health – it’s about how far is too far for the government to reach into our personal lives. A vote against this bill isn’t a vote against vaccinations – it’s a vote in support of parental choice and religious freedoms.”1

Our hearts go out to all the parents in Maine forced with making next steps about what’s best for their children. We stand with you.

418,"As the world grapples with how to safely reopen society in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, scientists have been racing to understand whether COVID-19 infection confers immunity—and how long such immunity might last. A lot hangs in the balance: A strong immune response could mean people who have already been infected would be able to safely return to work. And it would also bode well for vaccine development efforts.

A small but suggestive new study finds that individuals who have had COVID-19 produce a robust response in immune cells called T cells. The adaptive immune system contains several main components: antibody-creating B cells, helper T cells and killer T cells. The latter two are important for recognizing and destroying a particular virus, respectively. Alessandro Sette and Shane Crotty, both professors at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, and their colleagues found that of a group of 20 people who had recovered from COVID-19, 70 percent had killer T cells and 100 percent had helper T cells that were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. Importantly, the researchers observed a strong T cell response to the “spike” protein the virus uses to bind to and infect cells (and which most vaccine candidates target). They additionally detected a helper T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in about half of blood samples they examined that had been drawn before the virus began circulating. This observation, they say, hints that exposure to seasonal common cold coronaviruses may confer some protection against the new pathogen.

The findings build on earlier studies showing that infection with the novel coronavirus produces protective, or “neutralizing,” antibodies. Taken together, these results suggest that people who have had COVID-19 possess at least some immunity—an encouraging sign for the dozens of vaccines under development. Separately, this week the company Moderna announced early results from a trial of its coronavirus vaccine candidate: eight individuals who have received the vaccine produced antibodies to the virus at levels similar to those of people who had the disease.

Scientific American spoke with Sette and Crotty about what their study means for immunity to COVID-19, possible protection from seasonal cold infections and the prospects for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

What do we know so far about immunity to COVID-19? And why is it so important?

CROTTY: There’s just been a huge amount of uncertainty about immunity to COVID-19. And that question about immunity has two major implications: one, for just understanding the disease itself, and two, for vaccine development. It’s clearly been a world-on-fire type of situation. And so it has made sense for these 100-odd different vaccine programs to get going and just try moving things forward. The normal way you would try and make a successful vaccine would be to look at what gets you good protective immunity to that disease and copy that. A disease such as COVID-19 is normally an acute infection, and most people control and clear it without a lot of problems. That’s a good sign that indicates that the human immune system normally makes a good response to that virus and controls it.

But the immune system is a big, complicated place, with lots of different cell types with lots of different functions. And some are useful or important in one context versus another. For a vaccine, you’d want to know which components of the immune response are the important ones for protection against this disease. And without that information, you can very much go totally in the wrong direction with a vaccine program, either in terms of the type of immune response you’re trying to get or the [vaccine’s molecular] target. And both of those have been things that worried [Sette] and me and other people about these ongoing vaccine efforts. We really wanted to generate information that would help [us] understand the disease itself—and also generate information about which vaccine strategies are likely to be better or worse ones and whether people are getting the right [molecular target] or not. Our goal was to look at essentially average cases of COVID-19—ones where people definitely are making successful immune responses—and ask, “Okay, what does that immune response look like?”

Can you describe the different parts of the immune response and how they work?

CROTTY:Quite a few labs around the world have looked at antibody responses. Those are generally easier to measure and look at. But really, there are three parts of the adaptive immune system: you’ve basically got antibodies, you’ve got helper T cells, and you’ve got killer T cells. The T cells are tougher to measure, but they do really important things. You’ve got to have the helper T cells to get an antibody response. For example, in animal models, [helper T cells] are important for protecting against [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)]. And the killer T cells are important for most viral infections. You don’t want to go forward without understanding anything about the T cell response. And [Sette] is the world’s expert in predicting and identifying T cell [targets], particularly in humans. So we collaborated to get COVID-19 patient blood samples as quickly as possible and to try and get information about those questions. We mostly have concluded it’s good news: things have largely looked the ways we would expect.

Do we know how long the immune response to the new virus lasts?

SETTE:What we certainly can say is that the infection induces a robust immune response, and this is in people that successfully deal with the virus and don’t get very sick. The question [of] how long this response lasts obviously takes time, because we have been dealing with this virus for only a few months, and we cannot possibly know what is going to happen a year down the line. But what we’ve seen thus far is encouraging, because these T cells look healthy, look happy. They are not exhausted, and they don’t express some of the molecular features that are associated with cells that are about to die.

In general, immunologic memory is like any other memory in the sense that the intensity of the event dictates how strong the memory is. Pretty much like any event in your life: if it was a life-threatening situation—for example, you almost got run over by a truck—you remember. If it was instead what kind of socks you wore, you might not remember. It’s the same for the immune system, in the sense that a very strong infection with a microbe that reproduces to high levels generates a strong level of immune response, which then creates a long-lasting impression. I would speculate that the memory generated by SARS or [Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)] could be somewhat different from one generated from a common cold, which is fairly adapted to not cause much trouble in the human host.

You also saw some T cell responses, or “cross-reactivity,” to the new coronavirus in blood from people who were never exposed to it, correct?

SETTE: We looked at the COVID-19 patients, and then we looked at a control group. We purposely went after blood donations that were obtained in 2015 to 2018—before any SARS-CoV-2 was around. Surprisingly, in about half of these people, we could see some T cell reactivity. And we looked at the data hard from the left and from the right and convinced ourselves that this was real. We do not know, at this point, exactly what this cross-reactivity means, but it’s reasonable to assume that it is the result of people having been exposed to common cold coronaviruses that are different from SARS-CoV-2 but have some similarity [to it]. This potentially has very strong implications, because one of the things that is unknown and everybody wants to gain more information about is why there is such a spectrum of different COVID-19 outcomes: some people are totally asymptomatic, whereas other people die. Of course, age and other health issues are factors, but one element could be immunological: If someone has some T cells that can cross-react to SARS-CoV-2, their immune system has an advantage. They can get going to generate antibody responses faster, maybe, and that could give a better outcome. In the context of vaccination, this is also very important, because imagine that you have a group of people, and half of them have this coronavirus cross–reactivity, and half of them don’t. Now you give these people a vaccine. It could be that the people that have the common cold cross-reactivity will respond a lot faster and a lot better to the vaccine, compared with the other ones.

One piece of data that is encouraging, in speculating that some preexisting immunity may be beneficial, is data from the 2009 H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic. You might recall that in that case, older people did better than younger people. And in fact, it turned out that the age of the people that did better correlated with when another H1N1 strain, a cousin of the swine flu pandemic strain, had circulated—so that the people that had been exposed in the 1950s to this other strain, their immune system still remembered a bit. Not that the people didn’t get sick, of course, but they got less sick. And they fared better than people who were totally naive and had never seen this particular subtype of influenza.

Do we know whether people that had asymptomatic COVID-19 infections might be less protected against reinfection than people who had a very severe case?

CROTTY: We did this study with people who didn’t have bad diseases—sort of average cases who definitely got well. Asymptomatic cases are definitely a big unknown. We have no idea [if they will be protected against reinfection].

Can you comment on the Moderna results from the phase I trial of its coronavirus vaccine candidate and the prospects for a vaccine in general?

CROTTY: There are actually three human vaccine candidates that have been tested in monkeys that gave what seems to be pretty good protection: one’s an inactivated-virus vaccine; another is a chimpanzee adenovirus vector [a type of double-stranded DNA virus used to harmlessly deliver genetic material to a host]; and a third one is a DNA vaccine [a DNA sequence that stimulates the host to produce part of the virus and mount an immune response against it]. And then there's the Moderna vaccine, which hasn't been tested in monkeys but has been tested in a mouse model and in humans to measure their immune response. So those are the three examples of interesting vaccine candidate data that are available as of today. And I think if we combine those with the data from our paper showing that the T cell responses generally look good and data from a number of papers about people making neutralizing antibody responses overall, I would say those vaccine studies—particularly the two that were done in monkeys—suggest, so far, that it’s not that hard to protect against this virus. I'm certainly encouraged, based on the magnitude of the immune responses to the vaccines—and the magnitude of immune responses we’re measuring in people who actually have disease and what happens in protection models. So far the available data are positive here.

SETTE: One encouraging thing is that there are so many different vaccines that are being developed. So our hope is that there is not going to be a winner, but there are going to be many different winners. The one thing that is important from our study is that the vast majority of these different vaccine concepts rely on one particular protein, which is the spike protein. And we saw very good responses, both in terms of killer and helper cells against the spike, which is really good news, because this was not a given. In this particular case, it so happens that it’s a good target for all three different types of immune response—which bodes well for people that are developing the spike-based vaccines. At the same time, our data found that there were responses also against other pieces of the virus, which opens the way to thinking that maybe these other pieces could also be included to further fortify a vaccine concept.

302,"Scientists around the world are racing to find ways out of the new coronavirus pandemic. Some are working to develop new drugs and vaccines, while others are looking to see whether therapies we already have may help against COVID-19.

In the latter category, researchers have dusted off one intriguing compound in our collective medicine cabinet — a century-old vaccine to fight tuberculosis, a bacterial disease that affects the lungs. A couple of early analyses, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, have found that countries that require this vaccine, called Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), seemed to have been hit less severely, in terms of both number and severity, by the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.

Could this vaccine be protecting people from COVID-19? The short answer is: We don't know. But several clinical trials around the world are now examining whether this vaccine could protect against this new foe.

""I was originally quite skeptical"" that the studies could tease apart all of the other factors that could be causing some countries to be hit harder with COVID-19 than others,” said Paula Cannon, a distinguished professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, who is not a part of any of these studies. Among those factors are the quality of the healthcare system, measures put in place to fight the disease and testing capacity. Still, it is a ""provocative idea"" and the ""data is tantalizing,"" Cannon said.

Dozens of countries, including Japan and China, require children — typically newborns — to receive the BCG vaccine as protection against tuberculosis, an infection that is typically more common in lower-income countries. Other countries, such as Spain, France and Switzerland, used to require the vaccine but stopped because the risk of catching the disease in those countries lessened, according to one of the preprint studies published in medRxiv on March 28. Other countries, such as the U.S., Italy and the Netherlands never had such a universal vaccine policy for the BCG vaccine.

But scientists have long known that ""almost by lucky accident,"" the BCG vaccine doesn't just protect against tuberculosis, it also helps fight other viruses, respiratory infections in particular, Cannon said. The vaccine, ""in some sort of unexpected and magical way, is like a broad immune booster,"" she said.

For example, one study conducted in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa found that children who were vaccinated with BCG had about a 50% reduction in overall mortality, largely because the vaccine reduced respiratory infections and sepsis, or blood poisoning, according to the medRxiv study. Other studies, mostly conducted in animals, have found similar broad-spectrum protections from the BCG vaccine.

The BCG vaccine is made up of weakened forms of live Mycobacterium bovis, closely related to the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. It was first developed in the 1920s in Paris and later shipped all over the world.

Now, countries from Japan to Denmark have their own BCG vaccines, made using different formulations of live bacteria — and each one has varying degrees of immune-boosting ability, said Dr. Ofer Levy, the director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children's Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School.

Typically, live vaccines provide a ""strong and long-lasting immune response"" and sometimes even ""lifelong protection"" against the germ, whereas inactivated forms of vaccines, such as those in flu shots don't provide immunity that's ""as strong,"" according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

While most vaccines prompt one arm of the immune system — the adaptive immune system — to create antibodies that target very specific pathogens, the BCG vaccine taps into the other arm, the innate immune system. This system doesn't discriminate against pathogens and releases immune cells rather quickly to fight any foreign substance. The BCG vaccine thus boosts the body's production of non-specific immune cells.

The medRxiv study and another preliminary study recently published in Research Gate came to similar conclusions: there seemed to be a correlation between countries that require BCG vaccines and a reduced spread and severity of COVID-19 cases. For example, Portugal — which has required BCG vaccines for infants — has over 16,000 cases of COVID-19 but only 535 deaths whereas neighboring Spain has over 169,000 cases and over 17,000 deaths.

Similarly, Ireland, with 9,655 cases and only 334 deaths, requires the BCG vaccination, whereas the U.K. with 89,554 cases and 11,346 deaths no longer does. Based on these numbers, Ireland has a fatality rate 3.5% whereas the U.K. has a fatality rate of 12.7%. Of course, there are big population number differences across these countries, along with other variables that could affect death and infection rates.

These preliminary studies are ""very flawed,"" because many factors such as differences in wealth and testing ability, can affect the outcomes Levy told Live Science. But the authors are ""doing the best they can in a very difficult situation."" While there's no direct evidence that BCG vaccines will reduce people's risk of developing COVID-19, ""I'm enthusiastic about the hypotheses,"" Levy said.

It's difficult to draw firm conclusions, but there's enough scientific evidence to prompt clinical trials, and his team is looking into starting one in the U.S, he said. Clinical trials analyzing the protective effects of the vaccine against COVID-19 are already underway in other countries, including Australia and the Netherlands.

""I'm kind of puzzled,"" by the implication that the BCG vaccine might be able to protect for such a long period of time once someone has received it as a baby, Cannon said. Indeed, it's not clear how long the BCG vaccine effects can last.

The second study, which also has not been peer-reviewed, analyzed how countries with re-vaccination policies — or booster shots — fared in the COVID-19 pandemic. That study found that countries without re-vaccination policies had a 5.2% case fatality rate, versus a0.6% case fatality rate in countries that required re-vaccination.

""The big kind of asterisk, if you like, against all of these studies, is that they are really dealing with massively incomplete information,"" Cannon said. ""We're all guessing what the true infection rates and the case fatality rates are because there isn't widespread uniform testing in every country.""

Still, ""I applaud the authors for at least, you know, doing what they could with the available data and providing some very provocative hypotheses,"" she said. ""The good news is they're very testable.""

In another world, we would be doing animal experiments to test this hypothesis. In this world, amid the coronavirus pandemic, we don't have time for that, she said. But the BCG vaccine has a ""very safe track record,"" and likely can be tried in those who aren't old and who don't have weakened immune systems (since this is a live vaccine, it can potentially cause more side effects for older people or those with weakened immune systems), she added.

The human immune system is like an orchestra, ""it's massively interconnected and what the BCG vaccine seems to do is maybe it gives like a little bit of extra control to the conductor,"" Cannon said. ""So in the symphony of immune attack against respiratory viruses, the orchestra is able to go full blast, straightaway, all together, in sync, rather than kind of playing catch up.""

448,"26 year old Woman and family say the CDC and Health officials want her under quarantine and to get a vaccine or “Go to Jail” OR be charged criminally. Family says they feel threatened. The CDC and local Health Officials have called and showed up uninvited to their home. The frightened family was served a home intervention notice too.

Just moments after we published our friends in Washington DC’s piece (Alliance for Natural Health) about how a new federal order could allow you to be locked up and given drugs against your will- we saw the following about a young girl in South Pasadena:

Twenty six year old graduate student Ylsa Tellez and her family received an official home intervention notice from the county in Los Angeles (Ylsa and her family live in the suburb of Pasadena) The CDC and county officials have threatened this intervention (with possible jail time and charges) if she doesn’t quarantine herself and or do a forced vaccination. Ylsa’s younger sister has the measles but had a full recovery (like many healthy kids have for centuries) and she is asymptomatic. Also the family got a call from the CDC and wants her to get vaccinated and quarantine herself. She is resisting and insists she’s not sick and that they cannot force her to get a vaccine (or intervene as she is 26 years old) but she is weighing her options right now and will see if she gets the shot or not.

From the article on Ylsa who could be forced into quarantine and vaccinated.

Ylsa has no symptoms and feels perfectly healthy, but she said she received a call on Tuesday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and got a visit by the local health department, both of whom wanted her to quarantine herself inside. “(They were) saying I need to get vaccinated and I need to be quarantined, otherwise I’m going to go to jail or something, or I’m going to get a misdemeanor,” said Ylsa. Ylsa says she refuses to be a prisoner in her own home despite the possible quarantine order. Ylsa’s mother is also defending her daughter. “It’s not nice when my daughter is threatened like this because she’s not even sick,” said Myrna Tellez.

Her mother said on video above she does not like the fact her daughter was threatened like this by the health officials and the CDC.

Yisa goes on to say

We feel for Ylsa and hope that she and her family aren’t forced to vaccinate against a 26 year old WOMAN’s wishes. Her sister fully recovered and she’s not symptomatic and is taking immune boosting supplements. She said she’ll meet with her doctor tomorrow to make a decision .

925,"ALERT: Vaccine advocate threatens mass murder “suicide mission” shooting at public autism event… “I’m gonna kill every single one of you f##kers… see you in Hell” (VIDEO)

Thanks to the extreme hatred being whipped up against autism truth advocates by vaccine propagandists such as Jimmy Kimmel, deranged science troll Dr. David Gorski and the “fake news” media that’s beholden to vaccine industry propaganda, vaccine pushers are now resorting to extreme threats of violence and mass shootings to try to silence vaccine truth researchers, authors and lecturers.

In the last 48 hours, Dr. Suzanne Humphries, creator of the Honesty vs. Policy presentation and author of Dissolving Illusions — which expertly dismantles the most persistent myths of the pseudoscience vaccine industry — received a shockingly detailed death threat that promises a “suicide mission” mass shooting at a public autism event. (Full email reprinted below, WARNING: GRAPHIC.)

“I’m gonna make you f#cking squeal and shake on the ground… bleeding out”

According to the graphic, vulgar death threat received by Dr. Humphries, the would-be killer had plotted out a detailed kidnap-and-torture scenario that was engineered to make Dr. Humphries “bleed out” and suffer while dying, but they ultimately decided the kidnapping would be too risky to carry out. (See details from the email, below.) Instead, they are planning on blending in with the crowd at a public autism speaking event, then opening fire on the speakers to “kill every single one of you f##kers.”

“I’m gonna step right out from the pedestrians on the street and blast you right in the f#cking chest,” the threatening email promises. “I’m gonna make you f#cking squeal and shake on the ground, flailing, bleeding out. I’m gonna kill as many of you f#cks as I can before I go down. You’re done bitch, do you understand me?”

“I’ve finally decided I have to do it, no more f#cking around,” the vaccine advocate promises. “I want to make you scream so bad, to taste your blood and watch you scream, bitch.”

Here’s a full transcript of the threat letter sent to Dr. Suzanne Humphries, who has already filed a police report (and FBI report) over the threat. WARNING: Extreme profanity and vulgarity:

I’m gonna f#cking murder you, you stupid f#cking c#nt. I’m just letting you know, just to let you know that when it happens, you were f#cking warned bitch. You’re always puttin your location out there, so it’s real f#cking easy to get to you. I have a nice beautiful Desert Eagle that’s gonna be used on you. So keep thinkin all your health sh#t is gonna help you, cuz guess what, c#nt, it’s not gonna help you live another f#cking day.

I’m gonna step right out from the pedestrians on the street and blast you right in the f#cking chest. Not the head, cuz I want you to squeal, bitch. I’m gonna make you f#cking squeal and shake on the ground, flailing, bleeding out. I’m gonna kill as many of you f#cks as I can before I go down. You’re done bitch, do you understand me?

I’ve thought about how to do it for a while, and I have it pretty much down. I want to pull you off the road and torture you to death, but it’s just too f#cking hard to pull off. Another idea I had is when you’re doin one of your live things, I want to walk right to the door and shoot ya live on camera, so everyone sees you f#cking begging, c#nt, you’re gonna f#cking squeal so hard, cuz I’m gonna hit you in the chest, then the legs bitch, to make ya suffer before I finish you.

I want everyone to see how you go. I f#cking promise you I’m comin bitch. I just gotta decide how I wanna do it. Maybe when you’re giving one of your dumb ass talks, I’ll go sit in the audience towards the back and do it. But it’s not easy to kill all your dumb c#nt friends that way. No, it’s pretty obvious to me that I gotta come to your f#cking autism sh#t center and shoot you right through the f#cking door when you’re on camera. That’s how I’m gonna do it.

I’m gonna kill every single one of you f#ckers. Do you understand me? I’m f#cking comin for ya. So be ready for it. I don’t wanna see any shock on your f#cking face when I’m at the door bitch. I’m [gonna] f#cking shoot right through that door with a shotgun c#nt, I’ll kill every single person in that house and then I’m gonna torture you good bitch. I’m gonna make you bleed til there’s nothing left of you, then finish you.

I just need to get a few things in order before I do it, but I’ve been wanting for a long time, and I’ve finally decided I have to do it, no more f#cking around.

Dr. Gorski’s colleague, Dr. Farid Fata, was indicted by the FBI for cancer treatment fraud and is now serving 20+ years in federal prison. Dr. Gorski worked alongside this cancer fraudster and evil criminal in the Detroit area, with links to the Karmanos Cancer Centers.

Natural News has previously reported Dr. Gorski to the FBI and has named him as one of the six most sickeningly evil propagandists currently operating in the realm of medicine. He currently works for the Karmanos Center Center in Michigan and spends his work hours editing Wikipedia to savage “vaccine truthers” by posting false, defamatory and slanderous information on their Wikipedia pages. Dr. Gorski is a surgical oncologist who scars black women for profit and pushes deceptive cancer propaganda on the public, much like his colleague Dr. Farid Fata also did before he was arrested and indicted for multiple felony crimes.

572,"We had only been back from our family trip to Vietnam for a week when my son began running a low-grade fever. We had stuck to touristy areas and taken anti-malarial medication, but it was best to get him checked out just in case. Indeed, when his rapid flu test results came back, his physician joked that it was just an ordinary old influenza B, nothing tropical or exotic.

I had actually expected a flu diagnosis because we’d returned in the midst of the worst flu season the U.S. has seen in years. A whopping 7.4 percent of the country saw their doctor for influenza-like illnesses at the virus’s peak in early February, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Even now, the CDC reports, flu activity remains strong at 5 percent — more than twice what’s usually seen this time of year.

Plus, my son’s symptoms were mild, not the high fever I’d expect from malaria, dengue or typhoid — or influenza in someone unvaccinated. As a science journalist who has reported on vaccines for years, I hadn’t vaccinated my children expecting to prevent them from getting flu. I know the vaccine is often lousy at that. I vaccinated them to make it far less likely they would end up in the hospital — or dead, like 114 other children so far this winter.

But for the average person reading about the flu epidemic on the news, I understand the frustration. What is the point of a vaccination if it doesn’t actually prevent the flu? Is the shot ineffective? Does it simply not work sometimes? As it turns out, that depends on what you mean by “work.”

Too many people expect too much of the vaccine while not appreciating what it does do. It’s true that the flu vaccine isn’t very good at preventing illness in the way that most of our best vaccines do — measles, HPV, polio, diphtheria and hepatitis B, for example. Frankly, the virus is so well adapted to infecting humans that our best scientists haven’t been able to create a vaccine that prevents flu more than about 40 to 60 percent of the time (though that still cuts the risk in half).

“It’s what we call a leaky vaccine,” Brendan Flannery, PhD, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s Influenza Division, told me. “It provides partial protection for vaccinated people. It reduces their risk.”

The flu vaccine’s arguably more important purpose is preventing flu hospitalizations and deaths. This year, despite worry that the vaccine would only be about 10 percent effective, the CDC’s preliminary surveillance shows it actually is preventing 36 percent of all lab-confirmed flu, 59 percent of flu in children and 25 percent of infections from H3N2, the most virulent strain this year.

It’s also reducing how severe infections are. “It’s hard to measure effectiveness against more severe illness,” Flannery said. “Severe disease is less common, but usually we see estimates [of hospitalizations and deaths] that are very similar or a little bit better.”

In other words, getting the flu vaccine doesn’t guarantee someone won’t be hospitalized or die from the flu, but it makes it substantially less likely. As in past years, most children who died from flu this year weren’t vaccinated. Flannery led the Pediatrics study last year that found, for the first time, that flu vaccines cut the risk of dying from flu by almost two thirds (65 percent) for healthy children. For children with an underlying high-risk medical condition, the vaccine cut their risk of death in half.

In fact, a person hospitalized for the flu is two to five times more likely to die if they didn’t get the vaccine. In 2015-2016, the most recent year for which data exist, the vaccine prevented about 5.1 million infections, 71,000 hospitalizations and flu/pneumonia 3,000 deaths. And that number is almost certainly underestimated by two to four times because of how deaths are estimated: Total adult flu cases are not tracked, and many people with flu are never tested or seek medical care too late to detect the virus. Further, deaths often occur two to three weeks after initial infection, so it is usually flu complications, such as a secondary infection or an underlying condition worsened by the flu, listed as cause of death without mention of influenza on the death certificate.

All of which is to say I wasn’t mad that my vaccinated son got the flu anyway. That shot was probably why he spent his days home from school playing Minecraft and racing Hot Wheels around the house instead of moaning in bed from the aches and fever.

Yet fewer than half of Americans of any age got the vaccine this year. The most common reasons people give for skipping the vaccine is the idea that it isn’t necessary or, also incorrect, that it will give them the flu itself. First off, the idea that you don’t need the vaccine because you “never get the flu” makes about as much sense as never wearing a seatbelt because you’ve never been in a car accident. Never having the flu in the past doesn't mean zero risk of it in the future. And this year’s numbers should remind people how bad the flu can be, even in healthy people — and especially in healthy people who have never been infected with flu virus before.

Skipping the vaccine because you think it will give you flu is also faulty reasoning. Some people develop fever or aches as their immune system does its job responding to the vaccine, but flu shots are made with inactivated flu viruses ground into tiny pieces. The shot’s about as likely to give someone the flu as a chopped-up zombie returning to life. (Even when the nasal vaccine, made with a weakened live virus, returns next year, studies show it doesn’t give people flu, Flannery said.)

It’s ultimately up to each person to decide — every year — whether to get the flu vaccine. But it’s easier to make that decision more confidently with an understanding of what the vaccine actually does — and what it can’t do.

1067,"Prince William dons mask, eye protection to check out COVID-19 vaccine work at Oxford University

LONDON — Prince William has visited Oxford University's coronavirus vaccine development facilities to learn more about researchers' work there.

The royal was given a tour Wednesday of the manufacturing laboratory where the experimental vaccine has been produced, helping to cheer on British efforts to get a handle on coping with the killer virus.

Wearing a lab coat, eye protection and a face mask, and practicing social distancing, he checked out a laboratory where samples from the clinical trial are being examined by researchers.

It was his latest in-person public appearance since some of the young royals have begun emerging cautiously from lockdown to resume their jobs boosting Britain, with important alterations: Social distancing, avoidance of hand shaking, no walkabouts and wearing masks indoors.

The vaccine trials began April 23 and 10,000 people in the United Kingdom are in the process of being vaccinated to assess the potential success of the treatment. Trials also began this week in Brazil and South Africa.

Oxford has agreed a global licensing agreement with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, which has struck deals with the U.S., the U.K., the European Union, among others, to produce and supply the potential vaccine.

Researchers aim to eventually make the vaccine available globally on a non-profit basis, including to low-income countries.

The British government provided about $100 million to the university to develop and manufacture its coronavirus vaccine. Its partnership with AstraZeneca means the vaccine will be available globally on a non-profit basis during the pandemic period, including to low and middle income countries, Kensington Palace said.

Other vaccines are also in development and undergoing trials elsewhere, including in the U.S. and France.

William was briefed by researchers leading the vaccine development and trial, and he also spoke with those who were taking part in the trial.

926,"Wakefield said the allegations against him and his colleagues were unfounded and unjust.

His study in 1998, published in The Lancet journal of medicine, had linked the MMR vaccine with a subgroup of autistic children who also had serious gastrointestinal problems.

That study reported that the measles virus was lingering in the children's bowels.

A special U.S. court rules that measles vaccine is not to blame for cases of autism. More than 5,500 claims had been filed.

New research further debunks any link between measles vaccine and autism. Years of research with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) have concluded that it doesn't cause autism.

U.S. researchers retest by taking samples of children’s intestines and conclude there is no evidence that MMR plays any role in autism.

Measles cases in the U.S. are at the highest level in more than a decade, with nearly half of those involving children whose parents rejected vaccination.

Doctors worry that the trend is fuelled by unfounded fears that vaccines may cause autism.

Pediatricians are frustrated, saying they are spending more time convincing parents the shot is safe.

British doctors, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, Dr. John Walker-Smith and Dr. Simon Murch, whose research into the alleged link between a children's vaccine and autism, face hearings into charges of professional misconduct in connection with their research.

The hearings, expected to last 15 weeks, could result in them losing their medical licences.

The Institute of Medicine in Washington reviews five large studies that had tracked thousands of children since 2001 and concludes there is no association between autism and the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine.

870,"The number of childhood vaccines has grown exponentially in the last few decades creating a lot of controversy and debate.

This still growing list with an increasing number of side-effects, toxic adjuvants and chronic health concerns is being taken increasingly seriously by parents and adults who refuse to blindly trust the currently money-driven pharmaceutical industry.

While many would prefer to go back to the only six or so shots their grandparents received, the researchers are now attempting to come out with a product that may be even more threatening to our health than the current vaccine situation.

They are starting with one flu shot given at birth to last a lifetime, and predicting that all immunizations can come next in one shot.

Project, which is affiliated with medical centers, and also pharmaceutical and vaccine makers like GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.

Ironically, the expert to lead this super vaccine research Tobi Kollman admits that “[the researchers] know vaccines work but [they] don’t know how they work.”

Flu vaccines work 50% or less percent of the time because the virus is constantly changing and is hard to predict. Yet even though the experts do not understand how vaccines work (and likely how they create under-reported side effects), and cannot make an annual flu shot that works well, they are determined to create one that is supposed to last a lifetime.

Kollman says the vaccine will be created because the team has a ‘can-do attitude’ and “[puts] their money where their mouth is.”

The consumers are finding all of this extremely problematic as evidenced from comments on the article.

And considering the many possible adverse health outcomes recorded in the controversial “triple shot” MMR vaccine, it’s fair to wonder whether combining multiple vaccines (most likely with multiple toxic adjuvants) is a smart idea after all.

Most commenters are speaking out against this new shot:

“This is insanity! Why is this all about convenience instead of health?” – Tricia K. “Absolutely repulsed…There is no evidence on the long term consequences. No one knows the effects it will have on our children’s health in the long run. I will not allow my children to be test subjects.” – Eugenia H. “One super vaccine to rule them all… And plenty of super adverse events to go with it!” – Ashley E. “How in humanity can this be ethical? Or scientifically sound? That’s absolute violence on our immune system.” – Selina W. “This is scary. All vaccines into one shot? They can’t even get the ones they do have right.” – Trina L.

1223,"In 1980 the World Health Organization declared that the deadly disease smallpox had been eradicated, an accomplishment attributed to the success of the smallpox vaccine. The vaccine had been developed almost 200 years earlier by the British physician Edward Jenner, who had based his work on a piece of folk wisdom from the countryside that few doctors had taken seriously: people who caught cowpox, a mild viral infection of cattle, never got smallpox. In 1796 Jenner proved the truth of this scientifically in a famous experiment he conducted on an eight-year-old boy named James Phipps. Jenner exposed Phipps to a person with cowpox, then two months later exposed him to smallpox (this would be considered unethical by today's standards). As Jenner expected, the boy warded off the smallpox without any complications. Prior to this, there existed a form of vaccination against smallpox that consisted of exposing people to a mild form of the disease. Although this method often worked, it was risky, and the exposed person sometimes died. Jenner, who devised the word from the Latin for cow, is considered to be the father of immunology.

469,"Two California lawmakers announced a bill Wednesday that would end exemptions to mandated school vaccines due to “personal beliefs.”

Democratic State Sen. Richard Pan, who is also a pediatrician, will co-author a bill ending personal exemptions, though the legislation will most likely retain exemptions for religious beliefs, the Los Angeles Times reported. The state’s two U.S. senators, Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both support ending the opt-out policy and asked the state’s health authorities to reexamine the religious exemption as well.

Schools would also be required to publish the percentage of their students that are vaccinated under the law.

Pan announced the bill at a news conference flanked by parents whose children are not eligible to receive the vaccines for medical reasons. These parents expressed concern that parents of children who can receive the vaccines but choose not to are threatening their communities’ “herd immunity” to certain diseases.

California is one of only 19 states that currently allow parents to opt out for personal beliefs.

In 2012, Pan authored a measure that would require parents pursuing exemptions to consult medical professionals. He claims that the number of parents opting out of vaccinating their children has fallen by one-fifth since that bill went into effect.

California is currently weathering a measles outbreak that began at Disneyland in December. Almost 100 cases have been reported.

The state’s Democratic governor, Jerry Brown — who advocated personal exemptions to vaccines two years ago — indicated that he is willing to reconsider. “Any bill that reaches his desk will be closely considered,” a Brown spokesperson told the San Jose Mercury News.

The Mercury News also reported that personal exemption rates in California are up from less than 1 percent 15 years ago to around 2.5 percent now.

“Parents are letting us know our current laws are insufficient,” Pan told reporters Wednesday. “We shouldn’t wait for more children to sicken or die before we act.”

155,"A new needle-free flu vaccine patch revved up the immune system much like a traditional flu shot without any negative side effects, according to a study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. Though the research is in the early stages (the patch hasn’t been tested in humans), it’s an important step toward a technology that could replace needle-based vaccination methods that require administration by health care workers and biohazard waste removal.

“Scientists have been studying needle-free vaccine approaches for nearly two decades, but none of the technologies have lived up to the hype,” said Benjamin L. Miller, Ph.D., corresponding author and Dean’s Professor of Dermatology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. “Our patch overcomes a lot of the challenges faced by microneedle patches for vaccine delivery, the main method that’s been tested over the years, and our efficacy and lack of toxicity make me excited about the prospect of a product that could have huge implications for global health.”

Common skin disease paves the way for needleless flu shot

Transporting big molecules like flu vaccine proteins across the skin is difficult to do, as the skin is intended to keep things out of the body, not to let them in. The study team took lessons learned from the research and treatment of a common inflammatory skin disease to overcome this hurdle and inform their flu vaccine patch strategy.

In patients with eczema, or atopic dermatitis, the skin barrier is leaky, allowing pollens, molds and a host of other allergens to enter through the skin and be sensed by the immune system. Lisa A. Beck, M.D., corresponding author and Dean’s Professor of Dermatology at the University of Rochester Medical Center discovered that the expression of a protein called claudin-1 helps maintain barrier strength and lessen the permeability of the skin. Claudin-1 is significantly reduced in eczema patients (hence the leaky skin barrier) compared to individuals without the disease.

In past research, Beck found that decreasing claudin-1 expression in skin cells from healthy donors made the skin more permeable. Beck, Miller, and first author Matthew Brewer, Ph.D., wondered if they could use this induced permeability to get a flu vaccine virus through the skin. The key would be to disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the virus, but not so long to let unwanted things in.

How it works: Dermatology, chemistry and vaccine biology collide

Miller, a chemist, worked with Brewer, who was trained in vaccine biology and immunology, to develop synthetic peptides that bind to and inhibit claudin-1 in an effort to open up the skin barrier. They tested their formulations in human skin cells and identified a peptide that disrupted the barrier without any toxic effects.

Next, they designed a patch containing the synthetic peptide and a recombinant flu vaccine and tested two scenarios. In the first, they placed the patch on mice to prime the immune system and subsequently administrated an intramuscular flu shot to boost immunity. In the second they did the opposite, delivering an intramuscular flu shot first to prime the immune system followed by the patch to boost immunity.

In both scenarios they placed the flu vaccine patch, which looks like a tiny piece of tape, on the backs of mice and left if there for as little as 18 and as long as 36 hours. The patch effectively opened up the skin barrier, as measured by water loss through the skin.",conspiracy

1143,"“Leaky gut autism theory doubted”, was the headline from BBC News on March 17 2008. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail also reported that researchers have found no evidence to support the ’leaky gut theory’. They say that this theory proposes that vaccines such as MMR damage the intestine causing digestive problems, leading to the production of peptides “which can damage the brain and possibly cause autism”.

This well conducted study used reliable analysis techniques to compare autistic children across a broad range of intelligences to age-matched control children. Despite the newspaper headlines and coverage, the study did not look at the effects of the MMR jab and autism. Instead, it tested and compared the urine of autistic boys with the urine of boys without autism. The researchers conclude that there were no differences between the levels of peptides in the groups and say they have effectively disproved the ’leaky gut theory‘. However, further research is needed to establish whether a casein and gluten-free diet has other effects on autism.

The researchers call for more studies into special diet as a treatment for autism, but they do not suggest that their research has any implication for the discredited MMR vaccine/autism theory.

Where did the story come from?

Dr Hilary Cass from the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and colleagues from around England and Scotland carried out the research. The authors acknowledge the support of the research and development fund of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and the Chief Scientist Office in Scotland. Competing interests were declared. The study was published in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed medical journal.

What kind of scientific study was this?

This was a case control study that compared 65 boys with autism, aged between five and 11 years, with 158 control boys of a similar age.

The researchers say that, for a number of years, it has been thought that the urine of children with autism contains opioid peptides that originate from outside the body. Opioid peptides are chemical compounds that are so called because they resemble morphine. They can be produced by the body and through the digestion of foods such as grain and milk. Grains such as wheat, rye, barley and oats contain the protein gluten, that produces opioid peptides in the gut, while milk produces another variety, casein.

One theory for the development of autism is the ’leaky gut theory‘: the idea that children with autism become sensitive to gluten. The gluten is thought to inflame the small bowel. The resulting damage allows opioid peptides from food to be absorbed into the blood and then enter the urine. Before the opioid peptides in the blood are excreted they are assumed to cross into the brain and result in the symptoms of autism. Previous research has proposed that excluding casein and gluten (milk and grains) from the diet might help children with autism by reducing the amount of circulating opioid peptides.

The theory proposes that opioid peptides found in urine reflect a disturbance in the integrity of the gut epithelium (i.e. a leaky gut). Proponents of the theory hope that the peptides can act as a diagnostic marker for autism and predict that a diet excluding gluten and casein could help to treat children with autistic symptoms.

This study aimed to determine the occurrence of the peptides in the urine of children who have autism and those who do not. The researchers recruited 65 boys from two hospitals specialising in autistic spectrum disorders in London. For the control group, 202 non-autistic boys of similar age were recruited from mainstream infant and primary schools in the same area. A questionnaire was given to the parents of the controls to ‘screen out’ children with possible neurological or psychiatric difficulties. Forty of the controls were excluded from the study as their parents did not complete the questionnaire, or the boys’ results were abnormal or borderline.

Urine samples were collected from all the children and analysed using equipment that separates the chemical in a liquid (HPLC). Other equipment was used to identify small and fragile biological molecules, such as the opioid peptides (MALDI-TOF MS).

What were the results of the study?

The researchers say that their study finds no evidence of opioid peptides in the urine of boys with autism or similar disorders.

After adjusting for the amount of creatinine in the urine, which is a measure of kidney function, the researchers found no significant differences in the urinary profiles (shown by HPLC) between groups of boys with or without autism. In those cases where HPLC showed peaks in the locations at which opioid peptides might be expected to be found, further testing by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) showed that these peaks did not represent opioid peptides.

What interpretations did the researchers draw from these results?

The researchers say that “given the lack of evidence for any opioid peptiduria in children with autism it can neither serve as a biomedical marker for autism, nor be employed to predict or monitor response to a casein and gluten exclusion diet”.

The researchers say that these findings effectively disprove the ’leaky gut theory‘, which predicts that these proteins should be found in the urine of autistic children. They suggest that healthcare professionals and parents should stop testing children with autism for urinary opioid peptides, and note that commercial laboratories around the world still widely advertise these tests on the internet.

What does the NHS Knowledge Service make of this study?

This study has a number of strengths. The researchers used accepted and applied definitions of autism and selected children across a broad range of intelligence. The urine testing appears to have been conducted reliably and the researchers further analysed the peptide peaks found by chromatography (HPLC) with advanced mass spectroscopy techniques (MALDI-TOF). They acknowledge some limitations, however, including:
• The autistic children were selected from tertiary or specialist centres. This may mean that they had more severe autism than that commonly found in the community.
• It was not possible to match the autistic children with low IQ to control children with the same level of IQ. Strictly speaking, this means that the groups were not balanced at the start of the study. However, as no significant differences were found in the peptide levels between any of the groups that were examined, it is unlikely that a link would have been found between peptide levels and IQ either.

The researchers say that there is no evidence that opioid peptides can leak through the gut and cause autism in children. However, further research is needed to establish whether a casein and gluten-free diet has other effects on autism.

The researchers do not comment on any implications of their study with regard to the MMR vaccine. Immunisation is topical and attracts the reader’s attention, but well-designed research into other theories of how autism is caused is needed.",mainstream
699,"Gardasil vaccine manufacturer, Merck, announced earlier this month (June, 2018) that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted them a “Priority Review” to approve the dangerous and controversial Gardasil 9 vaccine to women and men, ages 27 to 45.

The Gardasil vaccine is currently approved for girls and boys, ages 9 through 26.

The request by Merck to expand its market to women and men, ages 27 to 45, and the FDA’s approval to grant it a Priority Review by October 6, 2018, follows 10 years after the FDA struck down a similar request to expand the older version of Gardasil to the same age group.

Back in 2008, after agreeing to a faster review in the age group, the FDA decided against Merck’s case for an additional Gardasil approval in females 27 to 45. The agency in 2009 issued a second complete response letter for that application, demanding Merck to provide longer-term efficacy data in the age group. That set of data apparently didn’t turn things around for Merck. In both Gardasil’s and Gardasil 9’s current labels, information about a study on 3,253 women 27 through 45 years of age states that there was “no statistically significant efficacy” demonstrated by the vaccine in preventing high-grade cervical lesions or cervical cancer.

So what has changed that Merck now wants the FDA to act on their request again? According to FiercePharma:

Observational and clinical data over the past decade demonstrate that women 27 to 45 are also at risk of acquiring new HPV infections, Merck spokeswoman Pamela Eisele told FiercePharma. Even though many people have already been exposed to HPV at an younger age, they have not been exposed to all nine HPV types targeted by Gardasil 9. Besides, a follow-up of the long-term study with Gardasil in women ages 27-45 showed no additional cases of HPV disease for at least 10 years following vaccination, a result that can be extended to Gardasil 9, she said.

Will the FDA Look at Published Data on Gardasil Side-effects?

Besides the hundreds of stories of young women being injured or even killed by the Gardasil vaccine, as well as the lawsuits mounting in countries outside the U.S., the published data regarding Gardasil just keeps getting worse.

Will the FDA consider these studies in determining if Gardasil should be expanded to a larger population? Shouldn’t the FDA instead be determining if Gardasil should even stay in the market, as other countries are beginning to ask?

Two recent studies published this year (2018) on the Gardasil vaccine should put an immediate halt on increasing the vaccine’s market, and should, instead, prompt investigations into the safety of this dangerous vaccine and whether or not it should remain on the market.

A study published earlier this month (June, 2018) in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health looked at declining fertility rates among eight million U.S. women, aged 25 to 29, during a 7-year period.

The title of study, published by Gayle DeLong, Ph.D., from the Department of Economics and Finance, Baruch College/City University of New York, is “A lowered probability of pregnancy in females in the USA aged 25–29 who received a human papillomavirus vaccine injection.”

This study analyzed information gathered in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which represented 8 million 25-to-29-year-old women residing in the United States between 2007 and 2014. Approximately 60% of women who did not receive the HPV vaccine had been pregnant at least once, whereas only 35% of women who were exposed to the vaccine had conceived. Using logistic regression to analyze the data, the probability of having been pregnant was estimated for females who received an HPV vaccine compared with females who did not receive the shot. Results suggest that females who received the HPV shot were less likely to have ever been pregnant than women in the same age group who did not receive the shot. If 100% of females in this study had received the HPV vaccine, data suggest the number of women having ever conceived would have fallen by 2 million. (emphasis added)

We did not find a single corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media report on this study, and based on previous studies shedding a negative light on Gardasil, one wonders if this study will remain published or eventually be retracted due to pressure from outside influences.

Given the fact that many women in the U.S. are waiting longer to begin a family and conceive children, the expansion of Gardasil to this older age group could have even more devastating consequences to fertility rates. Learn more about this study:

Another study published earlier this year in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics examined cervical cancer rates among women in Sweden and discovered a link between increased cervical cancer rates among women, aged 20-49, during a two-year period between 2014 and 2015, corresponding to increased HPV vaccination rates in this population group, years earlier, when mass HPV vaccinations started in Sweden.

The study has been retracted subsequent to being published, due to the fact that the study author claimed his life was in danger for publishing such a study and had to use a pseudonym, but in publishing the retraction, the Journal affirmed the validity of the data and study conclusion:

The data that this study examines is obviously very important when considering whether or not to expand the Gardasil vaccine to ages 27 – 45, as that is the same age group of the study subjects in Sweden, and it suggests that Gardasil not only does not prevent cervical cancer in that age group, but might, in fact, increase their risk of cervical cancer.

The U.S. FDA Should Follow Japan’s Example of Questioning the Risk of the Gardasil Vaccine Versus Perceived Benefits

We recently published an investigative report written by Vera Sharav of the Alliance for Human Research Protection, titled:

Japan Leading the World in Exposing Fraud with Gardasil HPV Vaccine Injuries and Deaths

Sharav showed how the Japanese Government does not have strong ties with pharmaceutical companies producing HPV vaccines and is, therefore, more prone to conduct honest investigations into the dangers of the HPV vaccines. Japan has not only rescinded its recommendation for the Gardasil vaccine, it has actually helped facilitate clinics to deal with Garsasil vaccine injuries:

A study released Wednesday supports the argument that infections during pregnancy may cause some cases of autism.

Women who had active infections with genital herpes early in pregnancy were twice as likely to have a child with autism than women who did not, a team of researchers found.

The findings, published in the journal mSphere, add to evidence that inflammation during pregnancy may affect the brain of a developing fetus.

""We believe the mother's immune response to HSV-2 (herpes simplex type 2) could be disrupting fetal central nervous system development, raising risk for autism,"" said Milada Mahic, a researcher at Columbia University who led the research team.

Viruses can infect a developing baby's brain — Zika is the most notorious now, but cytomegalovirus and rubella also cause severe birth defects, including brain damage.

But that's not what's going on with autism, said Dr. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist and infectious disease expert at Columbia who oversaw the research.

""Most people, when they think about viral infections, think in terms of viruses going into tissue, killing cells, damaging cells,"" Lipkin told NBC News.

But Lipkin believes that, in fact, it's the mother's immune response — the inflammation — that's causing the damage. It may be that inflammatory chemicals such as cytokines are crossing the placenta and affecting the developing brain of the fetus, he said.

For the study, Lipkin's team started looking at women who were pregnant in Norway in the 1990s. They found 442 mothers of children with autism and compared them to 464 women who had babies without autism in the same months.

Related: More Studies Show Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism

The women were tested for immune responses to four viruses known to cause birth defects: cytomegalovirus, rubella, herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1, which causes cold sores) and HSV-2, also known as genital herpes. The women were also tested for the toxoplasmosis parasite.

The women with high levels of antibodies to HSV-2 midway through their pregnancies were twice as likely to have a baby later diagnosed with autism. None of the other viruses seemed to affect autism risk.

""The elevated antibody levels to HSV-2 may indicate either recent primary infection or reactivation of latent infection,"" the researchers wrote.

Herpes infections are incurable and can flare up throughout a person's life. They are also very common, so having been infected with herpes does not mean a woman is going to have children with autism.

However, autism is becoming diagnosed more commonly.

Surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention find that as many as than 2 percent of U.S. kids have been diagnosed with autism — anywhere between 1 in 68 and 1 in 45 children.

The autism spectrum refers to a broad range of symptoms, from the relatively mild social awkwardness of Asperger's syndrome to profound mental retardation, debilitating repetitive behaviors and an inability to communicate.

There's no cure and no good treatment.

There are genetic links. If one twin has autism, the other twin is very likely to. There's also growing evidence that infections in pregnancy might play a role.

A 2013 study found that women who had flu while they were pregnant were twice as likely to have a child later diagnosed with autism. Those who had a fever lasting a week or longer — perhaps caused by flu or maybe by something else — were three times as likely to have an autistic child.

""A wide range of infectious agents has been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting the possibility that general immune activation in susceptible subjects, rather than a specific pathogen per se, is associated with risk of ASD,"" the Columbia team wrote.

""We speculate that ASD risk associated with high levels of antibodies to HSV-2 is not specific to HSV-2 but instead reflects the impact of immune activation and inflammation on a vulnerable developing nervous system.""

The team found the risk if a woman had signs of herpes infection only during the first trimester of pregnancy, when the brain of the fetus is developing quickly. It also did not have enough girls with autism in the study to be able to tell whether the risk is also higher for girls. Boys are far more likely to be diagnosed with autism.

""We are now looking at other triggers. We think that a wide range of different types of infections can cause this,"" Lipkin said.

""I think that this makes a very strong case for continuing to try to develop herpes simplex vaccines.""",mainstream
915,"A year after the emergence of swine flu, US health authorities and laboratories say the pandemic illustrated the need for new vaccine production techniques that are faster and more reliable.

At present, vaccines like the one used against the swine flu are developed inside eggs, into which scientists implant a weakened version of the virus that will grow into a form suitable for inoculation.

But that process is relatively slow and unpredictable, and experts say the future lies in developing vaccines at the cell and DNA-level.

""We have never been in a stronger position to create new and better vaccines,"" US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said this week on the anniversary of the discovery of the A(H1N1) virus.

The swine flu pandemic illustrated the need ""to bring the technology of influenza vaccine development and manufacture into the 21st century,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health.

The US government is now partnering with the private sector and investing billions of dollars into research to foster new vaccine development methods in time for future pandemics, Fauci told AFP in an interview.

He said US laboratories were able to quickly identify the A(H1N1) virus, isolate a ""seed"" for implantation in eggs and carry out clinical trials.

But despite their speed, they failed to produce the number of vaccine doses expected because growing the vaccine remained so slow.

""It's still a fragile technology, it's subject to vicissitudes that are beyond the control of the people that are making the vaccine,"" said Fauci. ""Unfortunately that's what happened,"" he added. ""We were fortunate that a single dose worked.""

He said bringing vaccine development ""into the 21st century"" would occur in two phases.

""The first phase is to make a conversion from growing viruses in eggs to growing viruses in cells, which is much more reliable, and being able to scale up,"" he said.

Cell-based development of vaccines is still not a speedy process, Fauci said. But the development of vaccines in eggs can take between six and nine months, and cell-based vaccine development is much more reliable.

Eventually, the second phase of perfecting production techniques will be a move to so-called recombinant DNA technology, where pieces of different DNA strands are combined.

The technology would eliminate the need for scientists to grow the target virus in order to extract a vaccine, speeding up the process to as little as two months, Fauci said.

Informed by its experience with the swine flu pandemic, the US government is now partnering with the private sector to speed the emergence of quicker and more reliable vaccine development methods.

Fauci cited a partnership with Novartis, which has built a plant for the production of cell-based flu vaccines in North Carolina.

""It will be a gradual process,"" he said. ""In the next year or so, you will be seeing some of these recombinant products ready to be used in humans.""

Another field of continued research is a so-called ""universal vaccine"" for influenza.

""That's the Holy Grail,"" Fauci, adding that it wasn't likely to emerge for another five to 10 years, though he remained hopeful. ""I think it's possible,"" he said.",mainstream
144,"According to two Merck scientists who filed a False Claims Act complaint in 2010 — a complaint which has just now been unsealed — vaccine manufacturer Merck knowingly falsified its mumps vaccine test data, spiked blood samples with animal antibodies, sold a vaccine that actually promoted mumps and measles outbreaks, and ripped off governments and consumers who bought the vaccine thinking it was “95% effective.”

According to Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski, both former Merck virologists, the Merck company engaged in all the following behavior:
• In order to do this, Merck spiked the blood test with animal antibodies in order to artificially inflate the appearance of immune system antibodies. As reported in CourthouseNews.com:

Merck also added animal antibodies to blood samples to achieve more favorable test results, though it knew that the human immune system would never produce such antibodies, and that the antibodies created a laboratory testing scenario that “did not in any way correspond to, correlate with, or represent real life … virus neutralization in vaccinated people,” according to the complaint. (www.courthousenews.com)
• Merck then used the falsified trial results to swindle the U.S. government out of “hundreds of millions of dollars for a vaccine that does not provide adequate immunization.”
• Merck’s vaccine fraud has actually contributed to the continuation of mumps across America, causing more children to become infected with mumps. (Gee, really? This is what NaturalNews has been reporting for years… vaccines are actually formulated to keep the outbreaks going because it’s great for repeat business!)
• Merck used its false claims of “95 percent effectiveness” to monopolize the vaccine market and eliminate possible competitors.
• The Merck vaccine fraud has been going on since the late 1990’s, say the Merck virologists.
• Testing of Merck’s vaccine was never done against “real-world” mumps viruses in the wild. Instead, test results were simply falsified to achieve the desired outcome.
• This entire fraud took place “with the knowledge, authority and approval of Merck’s senior management.”
• Merck scientists “witnessed firsthand the improper testing and data falsification in which Merck engaged to artificially inflate the vaccine’s efficacy findings,” according to court documents (see below).

US government chose to ignore the 2010 False Claims Act!

Rather than taking action on this false claims act, the U.S. government simply ignored it, thereby protecting Merck’s market monopoly instead of properly serving justice. This demonstrates the conspiracy of fraud between the U.S. government, FDA regulators and the vaccine industry.

Chatom Primary Care sues Merck for Sherman Act monopolization, breach of warranty, violation of consumer protection laws

Following the unsealing of this 2010 False Claims Act, Chatom Primary Care, based in Alabama, smelled something rotten. Three days ago, Chatom filed a lawsuit against Merck. That lawsuit record is available here:

 www.naturalnews.com

It alleges, among other shocking things:

[Merck engaged in] …a decade-long scheme to falsify and misrepresent the true efficacy of its vaccine.

Merck fraudulently represented and continues to falsely represent in its labeling and elsewhere that its Mumps Vaccine has an efficacy rate of 95 percent of higher.

In reality, Merck knows and has taken affirmative steps to conceal — by using improper testing techniques and falsifying test data — that its Mumps Vaccine is, and has been since at least 1999, far less than 95 percent effective.

Merck designed a testing methodology that evaluated its vaccine against a less virulent strain of the mumps virus. After the results failed to yield Merck’s desired efficacy, Merck abandoned the methodology and concealed the study’s findings.

…incorporating the use of animal antibodies to artificially inflate the results…

…destroying evidence of the falsified data and then lying to an FDA investigator…

…threatened a virologist in Merck’s vaccine division with jail if he reported the fraud to the FDA…

…the ultimate victims here are the millions of children who every year are being injected with a mumps vaccine that is not providing them with an adequate level of protection. And while this is a disease that, according to the Centers for Disease Control (‘CDC’), was supposed to be eradicated by now, the failure in Merck’s vaccine has allowed this disease to linger, with significant outbreaks continuing to occur.

Chatom Primary Care also alleges that the fraudulent Merck vaccine contributed to the 2006 mumps outbreak in the Midwest, and a 2009 outbreak elsewhere. It says, “there has remained a significant risk of a resurgence of mumps outbreaks…”

211,"And the government trusts the public to act as a responsible co-partner in public health. Rather than announcing an official lockdown that would fully close restaurants and businesses and force citizens to stay home, the Korean government has opted to keep more of its economy open. “We were never on lockdown, and we’re still not on lockdown,” Paul Choi, a consultant who lives in Seoul, told me. “But citizens have taken it upon ourselves to stay inside. We’re very careful to wash our hands and keep our distance. Almost everybody is wearing masks. If you don’t wear masks, you get looks on the street.”-

Before the crisis, Choi said, he would leave his apartment early, ride a crowded subway, elbow his way through a packed gym to the treadmills, and then go to the office. “Today, the subway is much less crowded, because more people work from home,” he said. “When I arrive at my office building, there are temperature cameras in the lobby. There’s a regular diner that I go to for lunch, and the staff there tell me that their work schedules have been reduced to avoid layoffs. Larger social gatherings, at bars and restaurants, have been paused.”

I asked Choi how the country had come together so quickly to stem the spread of the disease. “It’s about civic memory, not Confucius,” he said. “We remember MERS. We remember other epidemics. We know this is a marathon. But we’re in a better place because the entire society has been in this game, fighting together.”

As he spoke, my mind turned to vaccination. A live vaccine uses a weakened version of a virus to teach the immune system how to respond to the real thing. Long after the vaccine is gone, the body remembers its immuno-playbook and stands prepared to fight a stronger pathogen in the future. South Korea’s national immune system was instructed and strengthened by previous crises. Other epidemics came and went, but they left behind guidance that Koreans recalled and executed when they were suddenly confronted with the plague of the century.

South Korea’s world-class response to COVID-19 is not the product of religion, or cultural destiny, but rather the result of diseases bested and crises weathered. Unlike the biological response to a pathogen, public policy is not an automatic response, but a deliberate one. South Korea chose to learn. The United States entered this pandemic discombobulated, blundering, and hamstrung by our lack of readiness. Neither history nor contagion will wait for us to catch up. That is the bad news. The good news is that history will go on. And we still have time to learn from it.",mainstream
405,"Most pediatricians say parents have refused vaccines for their kids

More doctors are reporting encounters with parents refusing to vaccinate their kids than a decade ago, but parents’ reasons for skipping immunizations have shifted in the past decade.

A new survey published in Pediatrics on Monday reports that 87 percent of pediatricians in the United States say they encountered parents refusing to vaccinate their children in 2013. A decade earlier, 75 percent of doctors reported they had experienced vaccine refusals.

The most common reason parents gave, according to doctors? The vaccines weren’t necessary.

“Vaccines have been so good at taking diseases away that when we don’t see diseases, we don’t think they’re important,” said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a pediatrician and director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program.

It’s the paradox of vaccines — they do away with infectious diseases to the point that they no longer seem necessary. The uptick in parents feeling that vaccines aren’t needed is concerning, Edwards said. Recent outbreaks of diseases such as measles have been blamed on a decline in vaccination rates.

“If you have a four-way stop and everybody stops at the stop sign, we’re fine. If one person doesn’t stop, we’re fine,” Edwards explained. “But if more people aren’t stopping, we’re going to have an accident.”

The survey also showed a shift in the number of parents who cite worries about the unfounded claim that vaccines or thimerosal — a preservative formerly used in childhood vaccines — can cause autism as the reason why they didn’t want their children to be vaccinated. The proportion of doctors who had encountered autism concerns fell from 74 percent in 2006 to 64 percent in 2013. It’s the first documented drop in that concern, the authors said.

“I’m not surprised by that,” said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “I hear from pediatricians that’s been happening less.”

Offit, who was not involved in the Pediatrics study, said that scientific research and subsequent media coverage have helped to dispel the myth. The 2014 measles outbreak in California also served as “an education” about the importance of immunization, he said.

Many parents are concerned about giving their children too many vaccines in a short period of time, a nod to the idea of an alternate vaccine schedule that’s gained steam in recent years. Nearly 73 percent of pediatricians say that parents delayed vaccines because of scheduling concerns — something public health officials discourage because delays increase the time unvaccinated children are at risk of becoming sick. It’s not clear whether this concern increased or decreased — the 2006 survey didn’t ask doctors about vaccine schedules.

The retrospective survey asked pediatricians to recall encounters with parents. Doctors weren’t asked to keep hard numbers on those encounters, so the study could have introduced recollection bias.

More and more, doctors don’t want to put up with vaccine refusal. The rate of doctors who reported always dismissing families who refuse vaccinations from their practices nearly doubled between surveys. Their efforts to convince parents to vaccinate their kids are sometimes fruitless — pediatricians reported that they were able to persuade only about one-third of parents who had refused vaccines to change their minds.

The American Academy of Pediatrics is trying to give doctors some added ammunition in those conversations with parents. The organization released a new guide called “Countering Vaccine Hesitancy” to accompany the survey.

“Generally, doctors aren’t prepared. It’s hard to counter,” Offit said. “We need to arm physicians with info to answer those questions.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Dr. Paul Offit as head of infectious diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.",mainstream
218,"Bill Gates — who invests in the same industries he gives charitable donations to, and who promotes a global public health agenda that benefits the companies he’s invested in — has gone on record saying life will not go back to normal until we have the ability to vaccinate the entire global population against COVID-19.1

To that end, he is pushing for disease surveillance and a vaccine tracking system2 that might involve embedding vaccination records on our bodies. One example of how this might be done is using an invisible ink quantum dot tattoo, described in a December 18, 2019, Science Translational Medicine paper.3,4

According to statements made by Gates, societal and financial normalcy may never return to those who refuse vaccination, as the digital vaccination certificate Gates is pushing for might ultimately be required to go about your day-to-day life and business. Without this “digital immunity proof,” you may not even be allowed to travel locally or visit certain public buildings.

Gates has a history of “predicting” global pandemics with vast numbers of deaths,5 and with his call for a tracking system to keep tabs on infected/noninfected and vaccinated/unvaccinated individuals, he’s ensuring an unimaginably profitable future for the vaccine makers he supports and makes money from via his Foundation investments.

Along with Gates, The Rockefeller Foundation is also coordinating efforts in the direction of social control through the implementation of draconian COVID-19 tracking and tracing measures that are clearly meant to become permanent.

April 21, 2020, The Rockefeller Foundation released a white paper6 titled, “National COVID-19 Testing Action Plan — Strategic Steps to Reopen Our Workplaces and Our Communities.” In the foreword, Rockefeller Foundation president Dr. Rajiv J. Shah writes:

The plan calls for testing and tracing 1 million Americans per week to start, incrementally ramping it up to 3 million and then 30 million per week (the “1-3-30 plan”) over the next six months until the entire population has been covered.

Test results would then be collected on a digital platform capable of tracking all tested individuals so that contact-tracing can be performed when someone tests positive. According to the “National COVID-19 Testing Action Plan”:

To this end, they suggest using incentives “to nudge the voluntary use” of tracking and contact tracing apps rather than making them mandatory. They also call for the use of “innovative digital technologies” aimed at improving “workforce monitoring and early detection of recurrent outbreaks.”

According to the “National COVID-19 Testing Action Plan”:8

Call me jaded, but this sounds like a plan to surveil Americans so that they can easily be tracked down for mandatory vaccination once a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. It also creates the necessary infrastructure for vaccination tracking across the board, for all vaccines.

While they give lip-service to privacy and anonymization of data, privacy promises have been repeatedly broken in the past. Besides, the document clearly states that:9

Are You Ready to Give Up EVERYTHING Over a Virus?

“Privacy concerns must be set aside.” Infection status must be “accessed and validated in a few required settings.”

Infection status will be linked to schools, office buildings, places of work, airports, concert and sport venues — in other words, most areas people need or want to frequent, if not daily, then at least occasionally. Infection status must be known “for people to participate in societal functions.” Legislation must be passed to protect people from being fired from their jobs based on their infection status. Are you concerned yet?

Anyone who remembers the tactics employed in Nazi Germany, or anyone familiar with the current surveillance of the Chinese population, will realize where this is headed.

Reading through the plan, it should also be crystal clear that this tracking and surveillance program is not designed to be temporary. You can be strongly assured this will be permanent. It calls for hundreds of thousands of new employees, updating computer systems and new laws that in many ways resemble the implementation of TSA post-9/11.

Not addressed in this report is the question of just how often would you have to undergo testing. A negative test today may not be valid tomorrow, if you happen to come across someone who is infected between now and then. Would you have to undergo testing every single day? Once a week?

If regular retesting is not part of the plan, then the whole system is worthless as your infection status could change at any time.

Other questions not addressed: If you happen to be in the vicinity of someone who tests positive in the near future, would you have to quarantine for two weeks? Will your employer pay for that time off? Will you have a job when you come out of quarantine?

What if you quarantine for two weeks but don’t get sick and test negative for antibodies, then go out and happen across yet another person who ends up testing positive shortly thereafter. Will you be forced into quarantine again? Where does it end?

The tracking system The Rockefeller Foundation is calling for is eerily similar to that already being used in China, where residents are required to enroll in a health condition registry. Once enrolled, they get a personal QR code, which they must then enter in order to gain access to grocery stores and other facilities.10

The plan also demands access to other medical data. According to the “National COVID-19 Testing Action Plan”:11

In other words, this plan is far more comprehensive than merely tracking COVID-19 cases. It’s designed to replace the current system of “disparate and sometimes deliberately isolated electronic medical records systems across the country.”

While The Rockefeller Foundation’s white paper simply calls for the use of a digital “patient identification number” without indicating exactly how you would carry this ID number on your person, Gates has repeatedly talked about the “need” for some sort of implantable vaccine certificate.

In 1999, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donated $750 million to set up Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.12 Gavi, in turn, has partnered with the ID2020 Alliance, along with the Bangladeshi government, to launch a digital identity program called ID2020.13

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also funded the GSMA Inclusive Tech Lab, launched in 2019, the aim of which is to promote access to digital and biometric identity services and systems.14,15

ID2020, which also launched in 2019, is designed to “leverage immunization as an opportunity to establish digital identity.” This digital identity system is said to carry “far-reaching implications for individuals’ access to services and livelihoods,” so to think that Gates’ call for implantable COVID-19 vaccine certificates would be limited to that alone would again be a grave mistake.

Like The Rockefeller Foundation, Gates is not presenting short-term, temporary measures. They’re both aiming to implement a Worldwide control system. It’s not so far-fetched to imagine a future in which your vaccine certificate or “unique patient ID number” replaces personal identifications such as your driver’s license, state ID card, Social Security card and passport, and is tied not only to your medical records in total, but also your finances.

I remain confident that it would be a tragic mistake to trust Gates, Rockefeller, Google or any of the other players that are being brought before us as the saviors of the day. While most people are well-acquainted with the Rockefeller name, few probably know the true history of the Rockefellers’ rise to power. If you fall in this category, be sure to read “How the Oil Industry Conquered Medicine, Finance and Agriculture,” which features an excellent video report by James Corbett.

Those who are ignorant of history are bound to repeat it, and if the Rockefeller story tells us anything, it is that unless we realize what has been done, we’ll be deceived again and again, because the oil oligarchy’s end game is yet to be realized — if we let them.

558,"Financial writer and precious metals expert Bill Holter says forget about the relatively small sell-off in the gold and silver markets. The big worry shaking the markets is an enormous global credit problem. Holter explains, “Your protection about the credit market coming down is asset money, if you want to call it that. Gold and silver have no liability. They are not issued by a central bank, and there is no promise that has to be kept for it to perform. . . . Dollars, euros, bonds or what have you, those are all liabilities of a central bank or sovereign treasury. They all carry liability, and that’s what the problem is in today’s world. It’s a world completely awash in liability. . . . I think, ultimately, you are going to see a credit meltdown.”

Holter points out the U.S. government “Plunge Protection Team” is not only trying to prop up the stock market, but also is suppressing gold and silver prices. Holter says, “Friday’s hit in the gold market (down $60 per ounce) is obviously an ‘official’ movement because they don’t want people getting the idea that your safe haven is physical gold and silver. In other words, they tried to steer investment away from gold and silver by smashing it with paper contracts.”

Holter, who has two decades of brokerage and equity experience, also points out, “This coming week and the weeks going forward, I am sure there are all kinds of margin calls that will be forced selling. . . . So, this thing could become a self-perpetuating spiral (down).”

What about the Fed riding to the rescue again like in 2008-2009? Holter says, “Zero percent is very close to where we are right now. The Fed does not have the leeway they had back in 2008-2009. They were lucky then to get away with it. The markets are going to call their bluff. That’s pretty much what has happened already.”

Is there no bottom in the stock market here? Holter says, “Basically, that’s correct. . . . A cliff dive into a pool with two inches of water is a good analogy. . . . The global yield curve is fully inverted. . . . We have never had an inverted yield curve (short interest rates higher than long interest rates) that has not been followed by a recession. It’s going to be inflate or die. If they don’t inflate, the system will implode upon itself.”

Holter predicts, “I think in a short period of time you are going to see swings of $200 to $300 per ounce in gold and $5 to $10 per ounce swings in silver. From the standpoint of so much paper being sold compared to real physical metal, there is going to be a cash call. This will expose the fact that there are 300 or 400 paper ounces for every one real ounce that exists.”

On top of that, with China bailing out everything in China, it may have to back its currency to keep the yuan from hyper-inflating away. If that happens, Holter says, “Gold will have to be substantially higher to do that.”

In closing, Holter says, “Cash generation is slowing, and that is going to be a problem with servicing the existing debt. There is so much debt that it can’t be paid off. That is the problem. . . . I have said this many times, once the credit markets break, distribution will not happen and then it is credit game over.”

238,"Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is seeking funds to extend its early childhood vaccine program in developing countries. Gavi's CEO says he's confident the organization's $7.5 billion goal can be reached.

Even as the organization works to increase vaccinations around the world, in the U.S., some parents are rejecting vaccines for their children. One result is a measles outbreak that started in southern California. So far, 68 people, including young children, have gotten measles.

It started in Disneyland, often portrayed as the ""happiest place on earth."" Since January 1 it's also been known as ground zero of a measles outbreak in the U.S. that may have far-reaching consequences.

Measles is highly contagious. It can rob a child of hearing, vision, intellect and even life. Yet a significant number of American parents - including many in California - are choosing not to vaccinate their children.

They cite concerns about side effects, including autism. But there is no link between autism and the vaccine, say specialists like Dr. Martha Rivera.

""There's no risk of autism - that was disproven.. ..all the fear factors have been taken away,"" she said.

 

 Some of the world's top infectious disease experts say vaccines are not only medically effective, they are cost-effective, eliminating the financial burden of treating preventable diseases. Dr. Anthony Fauci addressed the issue in an earlier interview with VOA.

""If you had to pick out one intervention, if you balance the investment that you make in the research and the implementation and the health benefits, vaccines have to be at either the top of the list or very much on the short list,"" he said.

""Vaccines are among the most effective and cost-effective interventions that exist,"" he said.

1162,"Engineers at Sinovac Biotech in Beijing have been working on an experimental coronavirus vaccine (enlarged monkey kidney cells being used in tests are seen here) -- and that vaccine will be produced in Brazil, officials say

Brazilian officials on Thursday announced an agreement with China's Sinovac Biotech to produce its coronavirus vaccine in the state of Sao Paulo, where tests involving 9,000 volunteers are to begin next month.

Brazil has the world's second-highest coronavirus caseload after the United States, with more than 770,000 confirmed infections and nearly 40,000 deaths.

Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria told a news conference that the Butantan Institute, Brazil's leading research center, had reached a technology transfer agreement with Sinovac Biotech.

""The studies show that the vaccine could be distributed by June 2021,"" if tests prove conclusive, Doria said.

""This agreement would allow us to produce at large scale and immunize millions of Brazilians.""

Sinovac Biotech, one of four Chinese laboratories authorized to conduct clinical vaccine trials, said a month ago that it was prepared to produce 100 million doses of the vaccine under the commercial name Coronavac.

In Sao Paulo, 9,000 volunteers will be injected with doses of that vaccine beginning in mid-July, in the third and final phase of testing.

Last week, Sao Paulo State University announced that a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford will be tested among 2,000 Brazilian volunteers beginning in mid-June.

Doria used the unveiling of the Sinovac Biotech deal, which he described as ""historic,"" to criticize President Jair Bolsonaro.

""We have had to overcome Brazil's disagreements with China, with other countries and with organizations like the WHO,"" he said, referring to criticism of China by several of Bolsonaro's cabinet ministers.

In March, one of the president's sons accused the Chinese ""dictatorship"" of hiding what it knew about the coronavirus, prompting Beijing to demand an apology.

Bolsonaro in recent days has also threatened to withdraw Brazil from the World Health Organization -- as the United States did last month -- accusing it of ""ideological bias.""

Alluding to the controversy, Doria said, ""The politicization of disease has never saved a life, to the contrary.""

Since the onset of the pandemic, Bolsonaro has clashed with state governors over stay-at-home measures that they've adopted to prevent the spread of the virus.

He has continued to press for a resumption of economic activities even though infections continue to rise.",mainstream
154,"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is seeking to create a vaccine that, theoretically, would protect people from most flu strains with a single shot of a universal vaccine. Senator Ed Markey introduced a bill that would funnel no less than a billion tax dollars toward the project. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases researchers are working on a DNA vaccine that, instead of injecting a piece of virus into a person to stimulate an immune response, would inject synthesized genes. [No matter what the promoters (who will be given the money) say, if genes are edited, deleted, or added, there inevitably will be unintended consequences. These unintended traits can never be removed from the human gene pool. Once monsters are created – even accidentally – they will be with us forever.] -GEG

Children’s Health Defense Note: CHD has internal documents in which the FDA acknowledges that technology that allows for the creation of these new vaccines has outpaced their ability to predict adverse events. Shouldn’t our federal agencies be calling for a moratorium until we have that knowledge—especially since it is heavily reported that the CDC/FDA post-marketing surveillance systems are inadequate to pick up problems after licensure?

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has launched efforts to create a vaccine that would protect people from most flu strains, all at once, with a single shot.

Over the years, I’ve written many articles refuting claims that vaccines are safe and effective, but we’ll put all that aside for the moment and follow the bouncing ball.

Massachusetts Senator and big spender, Ed Markey, has introduced a bill that would shovel no less than a billion dollars toward the universal flu-vaccine project.

Here is a sentence from an NIAID press release that mentions one of several research approaches:

“NIAID Vaccine Research Center scientists have initiated Phase 1/2 studies of a universal flu vaccine strategy that includes an investigational DNA-based vaccine (called a DNA ‘prime’)…”

This is quite troubling, if you know what the phrase “DNA vaccine” means. It refers to what the experts are touting as the next generation of immunizations.

Instead of injecting a piece of a virus into a person, in order to stimulate the immune system, synthesized genes would be shot into the body. This isn’t traditional vaccination anymore. It’s gene therapy.

In any such method, where genes are edited, deleted, added, no matter what the pros say, there are always “unintended consequences,” to use their polite phrase. The ripple effects scramble the genetic structure in numerous unknown ways.

This is genetic roulette with a loaded gun. Anyone and everyone on Earth injected with a DNA vaccine will undergo permanent and unknown genetic changes…

Here is the inconvenient truth about DNA vaccines—

They will permanently alter your DNA.

The reference is the New York Times, 3/15/15, “Protection Without a Vaccine.” It describes the frontier of research—the use of synthetic genes to “protect against disease,” while changing the genetic makeup of humans. This is not science fiction:

“By delivering synthetic genes into the muscles of the [experimental] monkeys, the scientists are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.”

“’The sky’s the limit,’ said Michael Farzan, an immunologist at Scripps and lead author of the new study.”

“The first human trial based on this strategy — called immunoprophylaxis by gene transfer, or I.G.T. — is underway, and several new ones are planned.” [That was three years ago.]

“I.G.T. is altogether different from traditional vaccination. It is instead a form of gene therapy. Scientists isolate the genes that produce powerful antibodies against certain diseases and then synthesize artificial versions. The genes are placed into viruses and injected into human tissue, usually muscle.”

Here is the punchline:

Read that again: “the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient’s own DNA.”",conspiracy
1197,"This year thousands of children in Afghanistan will die from measles; they're among the quarter million of children worldwide who die annually from this preventable disease, a tragic situation that is at least improving.

Meanwhile, in the United States this year, thousands of parents will deny the measles vaccine for their children, having heard from someone somewhere that vaccines cause autism.

At the hub between these contrasting trajectories — measles deaths dropping from about a million to 250,000 annually since 1999 as a result of focused immunization programs, and measles on the rise year by year in the United States and United Kingdom since 1999 as a result of dramatic declines in immunization rates — is a 1998 study published in the Lancet that invented the vaccine-autism myth.

The Lancet, once referred to as a prestigious British medical journal,retracted that study last week, finally understanding that the work was flawed and that the lead author, Andrew Wakefield, hid data and lied about his financial stake.

Ooops, sorry about that outbreak

Here's the backdrop: An unknown British scientist named Andrew Wakefield and 12 colleagues published a paper claiming a link between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, gastrointestinal disease and autism. The Lancet promoted it; the news media reported it; and parents in wealthy countries believed it.

There were just a few problems, though. The first and most obvious was the fact that there were more authors than subjects. The study was based on 12 children from the hospital where Wakefield was working. For The Lancet to publish, let alone promote, work that negates years of medical wisdom based on a skimpy analysis of 12 kids was highly irresponsible from the get go.

Next was the article's opening line: ""We investigated a consecutive series of children with chronic enterocolitis and regressive developmental disorder."" Nope, unless ""consecutive"" means 1, 5, 8 and onward. Subsequent analysis of the methodology, which should have been done during the peer review process, revealed that Wakefield cherry picked the patients for the study.

Next came the lousy job in cheery picking. Although the paper claimed that cognitive problems developed a few days after the MMR vaccine, a simple investigation of hospital records revealed this wasn't so; and in several cases parents reported problems before the vaccine.

Next were the conflicts of interest. Seems that Wakefield was getting money from lawyers planning on suing vaccine makers, and he owned a patent on an alternative to the MMR vaccine.

Next were the questionable practices. Seems that Wakefield subjected the kids to invasive tests, such as lumbar punctures, which they didn't need and for which he never received ethical approval.

Just about every aspect of the study, such as the detection of the measles virus in the guts of these children, is questionable. Ten of the other 12 authors indeed formally retracted their interpretation of the results in 2004.

The UK General Medical Council, which regulates doctors, launched an investigation of Wakefield in 2004 based largely on facts revealed by British journalist Brian Deer about the aforementioned lies and fudged data. The Council issued their report in January 2010 and concluded that Wakefield had ""callous disregard"" for the children he studies. He may lose his right to practice medicine.

But what does Jenny McCarthy have to say? McCarthy, the author of the best book on the vaccine-autism connection to be written by a former Playboy bunny, and husband Jim Carrey are convinced that vaccines caused the autism in McCarthy's boy.

""Dr. Andrew Wakefield is being discredited to prevent a historic study from being published that for the first time looks at vaccinated versus unvaccinated primates and compares..."" blah blah blah blah blah, according to an exhaustive statement issued last week by the couple.

What this really means is that Wakefield is still a hero to many.

Are vaccines without danger? No. There's a slight risk of a serious adverse reaction. Far more dangerous, though, is driving to the doctor's office to get the vaccine, given the number of highway fatalities. Staying home might be best, particularly if your kid isn't vaccinated, because these kids are the source of the vast majority of measles, whooping cough and other outbreaks.

“Conspiracy theorists concentrate their time on transmuting the ""base matter"" of current events, official stories, propaganda and public relations into the gleaming golden truth buried within. They do this through the very right-brained activity of uncovering and inventing connections between disparate elements.

They create story-systems to understand and explain events - essentially a religious activity. For whatever reason, it’s much easier for us to deal with our internal contents by projecting them into the world around us. These outward signs inevitably become carriers of the archetypal content and psychodrama latent in the seeker.

Conspiracy theory also overcomes the strictures of literalism and the problems of simplistic thinking by experimenting with multiplicity of meaning. Ordinary events, people and signs become symbols bristling with complex, malleable, even contradictory meanings. Mystery is revived and idealized. Facts become more than the sum of their parts. Theory becomes poetry and even theology.”

735,"The band, who are set to release their fourth album ‘Strangeland’ on May 7 and embark on a mini- tour to support it, said the sound was inspired by ‘What Did You Expect From The Vaccines?’, the band’s 2011 debut album.

Speaking exclusively to NME, the band’s pianist Tim Rice-Oxley said: “We loved what (producer) Dan Grech did on The Vaccines album. It had just come out. He’d also done stuff with Radiohead and produced the second Howling Bells album, which I loved. As luck would have it, Dan was a massive Keane fan, so we ended working with him.”

Meanwhile, singer Tom Chaplin compared the process of making ‘Strangeland’ to their 2004 debut ‘Hopes And Fears’. He said: “The process began in 2010. We began demoing tracks then. It’s the longest we’ve spent making a record since ‘Hopes and Fears’.”

He added: “The album has the vibe of earlier Keane. 2008’s ‘Perfect Symmetry’ was a big self-indulgent and this record felt a bit more like we knew ourselves a bit better and what our strengths were.”

Rice-Oxley added: “We wanted it be less production led and focus on making sure that the songs were great. You write a lot of shit songs to get to the good ones.”

He said the album was more deeply felt than before. “It’s a very emotional album. The title track is about setting off in a certain path in life and thinking it’s going to go one way, but finding out life’s taken a detour. Pretty much every song on the album is about that. (But) it’s a more hopeful record than it might sound!”

The band recently revealed the artwork for the album. They will play a nine date mini-tour in May. The run begins at Newcastle’s O2 Academy on May 23 and runs until June 8, when Keane will headline London’s O2 Academy Brixton.

1243,"Re “Low Prices for Vaccines Can Come at a Great Cost” (The Upshot, nytimes.com, June 27):

While this article claims that a $2,000 vaccination is a bargain for a lifetime of coverage, it doesn’t recognize that vaccines are useless if they sit on shelves priced out of the reach of the children who need them most.

In a world where countries struggle to afford lifesaving preventions like the pneumonia vaccine, high prices mean fewer children vaccinated, threatening individual and public health.

For example, Pfizer and GSK have made more than $30 billion in seven years from their duopoly on pneumonia vaccines, while at the lowest global prices, the vaccine package recommended for every child is 68 times more expensive than it was just over a decade ago. This, in part, means that 18.7 million babies, most of whom live in low-income, high-risk regions, haven’t received basic vaccines.

Additionally, there’s no proof that increasing prices would make drug companies invest in certain vaccines to prevent shortages. Earlier this year, the United Nations World Health Assembly reported that shortages are worsened by many factors. High prices do little except leave the most vulnerable children unprotected.",mainstream
1151,"Things you can do on the day

There are some things you could try that may help your child's vaccination appointment go smoothly.

What to expect after the appointment

Your baby or child may cry for a little while after a vaccination, but they should feel better after a cuddle.

Sometimes the area where the needle goes in can be sore and red for 2 to 3 days. This should go away on its own.

Some children may also develop a high temperature (fever).

How to treat a high temperature after vaccination
• make sure they're not wearing too many layers of clothes or blankets
• give them liquid paracetamol or ibuprofen for children to bring their temperature down

It's recommended that you give your baby liquid paracetamol after the MenB vaccine to reduce the risk of a high temperature. This vaccine is given at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 1 year old.

Make sure you follow the instructions that come with the medicine. If you're unsure, ask a pharmacist for advice.

It's rare for anyone to have a serious allergic reaction to a vaccination. If this does happen, it usually happens within minutes.

The person who vaccinates you or your child will be trained to deal with allergic reactions and treat them immediately. With prompt treatment, your child will make a good recovery.

792,"When a virus invades your cells, it changes your body. But in the process, the pathogen changes its shape, too. A new mathematical model predicts the points on the virus that allow this shape-shifting to occur, revealing a new way to find potential drug and vaccine targets. The unique math-based approach has already identified potential targets in the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

Outlined in April in the Journal of Computational Biology, the strategy predicts protein sites on viruses that stash energy—important spots that drugs could disable. In a rare feat, the work proceeds from pure mathematics, says study author and mathematician Robert Penner of the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies in France. “There's precious little pure math in biology,” he adds. The paper’s predictions face a long road before they can be verified experimentally, says John Yin, who studies viruses at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and was not involved in the research. But he agrees that Penner’s approach has potential. “He’s coming at this from a mathematician’s point of view—but a very scientifically informed mathematician,” Yin says. “So that’s highly rare.”

Penner’s method takes advantage of the fact that certain viral proteins alter their shape dramatically when viruses breach cells, and this transformation depends on unstable features. (A stable protein site, by definition, resists change.) By identifying “high free energy sites”—areas on a viral protein that store lots of energy—Penner realized he could spot likely “spring” points that mediate this change in shape. He calls such high-energy spots exotic sites. Finding them required some complex math.

Penner focused on the backbones of the proteins that undergo the most change during cell fusion and entry. He examined the hydrogen bonds that form between backbone sections when proteins fold. A protein consists of a series of individual units, or residues, with two such units forming hydrogen bonds. The bonded units rotate relative to each other, and those twists imply varying amounts of free energy in the residues involved.

To isolate the exotic rotations, Penner cranked a few mathematical levers on a giant collection of protein shapes. He and his colleagues had previously gathered a representative sample of proteins from a database and looked at the roughly 1.17 million backbone hydrogen bonds in the set. He then needed to establish how frequently different rotations appeared.

To find that information, Penner turned to geometry. In the 19th century, German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that you can describe each unique rotation of three-dimensional space by specifying the axis around which that rotation turns and the amount by which it does so (picture a wheel turning around car axle by anywhere from zero to 360 degrees, or zero to two pi radians). You can represent each rotation with a vector, a measurement that has both a magnitude and a direction and that is usually pictured as an arrow of a certain length pointing in a specific direction. This arrow’s orientation describes the rotation’s axis, and the vector’s length gives the amount of rotation (imagine an axle that lengthens with further rotation). Collect all the vector arrows pointing out every which way from a central point, and you have all possible axes for a rotation to spin about. Spots along each axis (the arrow points of different vectors) identify all unique rotations: the possible amounts of rotation, from zero to two pi radians, around every axis.

Altogether these arrows make up a 3-D ball (imagine a spiny Koosh ball or a rolled-up hedgehog). This structure is what Penner wanted, because it allowed him to do some math on the points appearing in it. Penner mapped the rotations found in the database onto the ball. Then he calculated the frequency of each one by looking at the density of its surrounding region in the structure: rotations in less dense parts of the ball are rarer.

Scientists know that the frequency of a protein feature is related to a function of its free energy, such that rarer features have higher energies. So using established equations and the densities on the ball, Penner computed the free energy of different rotations, revealing exotic sites. One indication that the approach works is that it predicted already known functional sites, Penner says. But previously unknown sites discovered by this method could prove to be promising targets for drugs to attack.

If experiments verify Penner's predicted sites—a big if—the approach holds promise, says Arndt Benecke, a biological researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research, who advises the mathematician. “If that were the case, then automatically, the free energy is something you could target that we’re not currently doing,” he says. “The whole thought of what could or should a drug or antibody do might change.”

In a follow-up study published in the same journal on Wednesday, Penner pinpointed three exotic “sites of interest” on the coronavirus behind COVID-19. But now they must survive the rigors of the lab. Experimenters need to show that knocking out the sites indeed releases free energy, Benecke says. Even then, they may remain inaccessible to drugs, he adds. And any treatments targeting the sites must survive the usual tests for efficacy and safety in animal models and then in people. “The literature is littered with failures,” Penner says.

Still, if the method works, it could have applications for a wider range of targets, from the signaling proteins that allow cells to communicate with their environment to prions, the misfolded proteins behind conditions such as mad cow disease. “This could go far beyond the viruses,” Benecke says.

Trials of a vaccine being developed by Oxford University are currently ongoing with the initial target of September to be available to the public.

Drug company Astra Zeneca has said it will produce the vaccine light so it’s ready when final approval is given and intends to produce two billion doses thanks to funding from Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates.

The Oxford University team are reportedly “80 per cent confident” the Covid-19 vaccine work in younger people and say the vaccine could be given using a device like an asthma inhaler next month.

The news came in an online lecture for Oxford University's Centre for Personalised Medicine given by team member Professor Adrian Hill, the Daily Mail reports.

He said that clinical trials will end when the vaccine has clearly been found to protect people.

“We are guessing that might be around about August time - it might be before if cases do not decline as quickly as we expect, or be later if we run out of cases,” he said.

The Oxford trial began back in April and began recruiting up to 10,260 adults over 55 and children.

AstraZeneca has already agreed to supply 100 million doses of the potential vaccine to the UK.

125,"As the influenza season heads in, Carol Baker, who chairs the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases' Childhood Influenza Immunization Coalition, answers some common questions about the flu vaccine. Baker is a professor of pediatrics, molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

 

 Q. What is the flu vaccine and who should receive it?

 

 A. The influenza vaccine protects against three different strains of the virus that are determined each year by flu trends in the Southern Hemisphere six months previously. This year's vaccine is identical to last year's. But even if you got the flu shot last year, it's still important to get one this year because the vaccine doesn't last more than a year, at most.

 

 In general, everyone 6 months of age and older should receive the vaccine. It's especially important that the very old, the very young, people with compromised immune systems and pregnant women be vaccinated, because they are the populations more likely to develop serious complications. During the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, 5 percent of the deaths from the outbreak were pregnant women. Immunity passes from the mother to the baby in utero and protects them against the flu until they are old enough to be vaccinated. Because infants can't be immunized until they are 6 months, they should be surrounded by vaccinated people, just as cancer patients and other especially vulnerable people should be surrounded by people who are vaccinated.

 

 Q. How effective is the flu vaccine? 

 

 A. Unfortunately, getting vaccinated won't guarantee you won't get the flu, but it greatly lessens the chance. Even if the vaccine is a good match to the flu strains that year, its effectiveness is just 70 percent. Everyone in the medical world agrees we need a better vaccine that covers all strains and lasts a lot longer. Scientists around the world are working on developing a universal vaccine that potentially would work like the measles vaccine — two doses and you're protected for life — but this is five to seven years off or longer.

 

 Q. What is new this year?

 

 A. The Fluzone high-dose vaccine, which is four times stronger than the standard dose, is being offered to adults 65 and older. The standard vaccine does not work as well in older people and young children, and we hope that the higher dose of antigen in this vaccine will strengthen their immune response.

 

 For people who avoid the flu vaccine because they are afraid of needles, the intradermal vaccine uses an ultrafine needle to inject the flu vaccine directly into the skin, instead of the muscle. The needle is 90 percent smaller. Only healthy people, aged 18 to 54, can receive the intradermal vaccine.

 

 This year, children under 9 who were fully vaccinated last year only need one dose of the flu vaccine, because it is the same as last year. Normally, children under 9 receive two doses. Children who were not vaccinated last year should receive two doses, as usual. Also, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children with minor allergies to eggs receive the vaccine. Previously, children with egg allergies were not vaccinated. Parents of children with more serious egg allergies should talk to their health care professionals.

 

 Q. What are some of the myths about the flu vaccine?

 

 A. The oldest and worst myth I've heard — and I've even heard nurses say this — is, ""I got the vaccine and it caused the flu."" The shot is made up of dead virus that can't give anyone the flu, and even the live virus present in the nasal spray flu vaccine has been weakened so much that it won't cause any symptoms. It takes two weeks for the flu shot to become effective. That's why I tell people to get flu vaccine early. The flu usually starts with winter and peaks in February. If the vaccine is available in September, get it in September.

 

 I also hear a lot of people say: ""My child is healthy, so he doesn't need to be vaccinated. Only children with weakened immune symptoms really need the flu shot."" In reality, about 150 children died last year from the flu, and about half of them were previously healthy. Likewise, about 20,000 children were hospitalized due to complications from the flu and about half of them were previously healthy.

 

 Q. What can you do if you get the flu? 

 

 A. Remember, it's very contagious, so use cough and hand hygiene to keep it from spreading. Prescription drugs, like Tamiflu, are effective in shortening the duration of the illness, but you need to begin taking them within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms. People really shouldn't go to work. They're not productive and can make everyone else sick. The best thing, though, is to try to prevent the flu by making it a habit to get vaccinated every year.",mainstream

President Clinton Unveils Millennium Initiative to Promote Delivery of Existing Vaccines 

in Developing Countries and Accelerate Development of New Vaccines In his State of the Union address, President Clinton will call for concerted international action to combat infectious diseases in developing countries. These diseases cause almost half of all deaths worldwide of people under age 45, killing over eight million children each year and orphaning millions more. The President committed the United States to addressing this terrible problem in his September speech to the United Nations General Assembly. Now the President is asking for foundations, pharmaceutical companies, international agencies, and other governments to join us in this task, and he is announcing these specific elements of his Millennium Initiative:
• A new financial commitment to purchase and deliver existing vaccines in poor countries. As Vice President Gore told the U. N. Security Council earlier this month, the Administration�s FY 2001 budget will include a proposed $50 million contribution to the vaccine purchase fund of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).
• Increased investments in health in developing countries. The President is calling on the World Bank and other multilateral development banks to dedicate an additional $400 million to $900 million annually of their low-interest-rate loans to expand immunization, prevent and treat infectious diseases, and build effective delivery systems for other basic health services. These investments are as central to economic progress as investments in education and physical infrastructure, and they would build on the new focus on basic health services that we have supported as part of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative. This proposed shift in existing resources does not require additional U.S. budget expenditures.
• A significant increase in basic research on diseases that affect developing nations. The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for the National Institutes of Health includes a sharp step-up in research critical to the development of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.
• A new tax credit for sales of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS to accelerate the invention and production of these vaccines. Because developing countries often cannot afford to buy vaccines, the market provides little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines for diseases that disproportionately affect those countries. This tax credit would provide such an incentive, because every dollar paid by a qualifying organization to buy a qualifying vaccine would be matched by a dollar of tax credits � representing up to $1 billion of additional funding for future vaccine purchases. The President is calling on other governments to make similar purchase commitments, so that we can ensure a future market for these critically needed vaccines. Infectious Diseases Pose a Mounting Social and Economic Burden on Developing Countries � And a Threat to Our Health As Well.
• More than eight million children die each year of centuries-old diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and respiratory and diarrheal diseases. Deaths from the modern scourge of AIDS are climbing rapidly. Altogether, as many children die of infectious diseases each year as the total number of combatants who perished in World War I.
• In an interconnected and highly mobile world, health crises in other countries are a threat to everyone. We have seen this with HIV/AIDS, with the resurfacing of tuberculosis, and with the outbreak last year of West Nile encephalitis in New York. According to the Global Health Council, during the past 50 years, at least five times as many Americans have died from communicable diseases that have come from the developing world than have died in military conflicts. Vaccines Are One of the Most Cost-Effective Ways to Improve the Well-Being and Productivity of the Poorest Countries � And Medicines and Other Basic Health Services Are a Necessary Complement.
• It costs about $17 to immunize a child, but millions of children die each year of diseases that could be prevented by existing vaccines. Indeed, children in developing nations are 10 times more likely to die of a vaccine-preventable disease than children in developed nations. And these tragedies occur in spite of the enormous efforts of UNICEF and others to vaccinate children, which save 3 million lives each year.
• Highly effective vaccines do not yet exist for malaria, TB and AIDS, which take over 5 million lives each year. But developed nations have the scientific and technological capacity to make new vaccines possible. For example, recent work on genetic sequencing, including the human genome, will open vast possibilities.
• Another health investment with very high returns is simple preventive and curative services. Providing this basic health care together with vaccines would save millions of lives each year. A $50 Million Contribution to GAVI to Buy Vaccines For Children � Which Will Save Lives Now and Create Confidence that a Market for New Vaccines Will Exist in the Future.
• GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, was formed as a collaborative effort of UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, private foundations, bilateral aid agencies (including the U.S. Agency for International Development), industry representatives, and developing countries. GAVI established the �Global Fund for Children�s Vaccines� with an initial grant of $750 million over 5 years from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The formal launch of GAVI, and the official announcement of the Gates gift, will occur shortly in Davos, Switzerland.
• A U.S. contribution will help to purchase vaccines for Hepatitis B, Haemophilus Influenzae B (Hib), and Yellow Fever, along with related safe delivery equipment such as auto-destruct syringes. To ensure that GAVI�s vaccine purchases complement, rather than replace, existing vaccination efforts, they will be conditional on a country achieving 50 percent coverage of the DTP (diptheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccine, which is included along with measles and polio in the existing EPI (Expanded Program for Immunization).
• A U.S. contribution will hopefully catalyze significant contributions from other countries and foundations. It will also add crucial credibility to the international community�s commitment to provide a market for new vaccines when they are developed. We Must Shift Existing International Resources Toward Building Health Infrastructure in Poor Countries That Can Deliver Vaccines and Medicines and Provide Essential Basic Health Services.
• The World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs, such as the African Development Fund) lend money on highly favorable terms to the world�s poorest countries. Today, roughly $1 billion to $1-1/2 billion of this so-called � concessional funding� is devoted to health care each year. The Administration proposes to increase that amount by $400 million to $900 million per year, with a focus on:
• prevention of diseases using basic measures such as information and condoms for AIDS, treated bed nets for malaria, and stronger systems for containing TB;
• treatment of diseases, including common respiratory and diarrheal infections; and
• The Administration is exploring ways to use the HIPC debt reform to support this part of the Millennium Initiative. One possibility is to make an increase in vaccination rates one of the performance targets monitored in the HIPC progress reports. This could be accompanied by debtor countries� agreements to include specific improvements in vaccine delivery systems as priority uses of debt relief proceeds. We also expect that all Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers that are prepared for HIPC candidates will discuss the adequacy of budget resources and suggested policy reforms devoted to basic health care.
• This re-direction of resources supports the Administration�s overall strategy for global development, which emphasizes poverty reduction and gives a central role to �global public goods� � like health or the environment � in which positive actions taken in one country benefit other countries as well. To meet this objective, these funds should not come from spending on other basic social programs, such as education and health care.
• This aspect of the Millennium Initiative does not require a new budgetary commitment by the United States (or other donor countries). However, the U.S. ability to influence the direction of MDB lending and the use of HIPC proceeds depends crucially on meeting our existing commitments to these aid programs. We will work with other G-8 finance and development ministries to refine this proposal.
• A conservative estimate suggests that if basic health care including immunization were made broadly available, up to 2 million children�s lives could be saved each year. Higher Funding for Basic Scientific Research Through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Elsewhere Will Hasten the Development of Vaccines for Malaria, TB, and AIDS.
• The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for NIH includes a significant increase in research critical to creating vaccines for these diseases. For malaria and TB, this increase will build on recent advances in the genetic sequencing of these diseases, which have set the stage for major breakthroughs in vaccine development.
• Funding for NIH malaria vaccine research will increase more than 10 percent over the FY 2000 level. Future research will range from pre-clinical studies aimed at improving our understanding of the malaria parasite, through the development of vaccine candidates, to clinical trials judging vaccine efficacy and safety. NIH will also expand its collaboration with scientists in malaria-endemic regions, especially in Africa, to strengthen those regions� capacity for conducting clinical trials of malaria vaccines in the future.
• NIH research on a tuberculosis vaccine will receive over 40 percent more funding than in FY 2000 and more than double the FY 1999 level. NIH will focus on studying the body�s defense mechanisms against TB, and developing and studying vaccine candidates. Through its Tuberculosis Research Unit, NIH supports an international multi-disciplinary team to translate advances in basic research into new tools for fighting TB.
• NIH funding for AIDS vaccine research will increase substantially in FY 2001 and will have more than doubled since FY 1997. These additional resources will allow NIH to accelerate basic research on developing vaccine candidates and to significantly expand testing of potential vaccine candidates in both developing and developed countries. The new Vaccine Research Center on the NIH campus, which will be occupied this summer, will receive a sizeable increase in funding for the development and pre-clinical testing of HIV vaccine candidates.
• The Administration is providing strong support for the path-breaking research on infectious diseases being conducted by U.S. military scientists, including the opening (in October 1999) of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research/Naval Medical Research Center. Working in close collaboration with scientists worldwide, military scientists have developed and tested successful vaccines against Japanese encephalitis and hepatitis A � and they are working to create vaccines and medicines to protect service people, travelers, and millions of others from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases. A New Tax Credit Would Effectively Provide Up to $1 Billion for Future Vaccine Purchases, Speeding the Invention and Production of New Vaccines.
• Current tax law provides substantial incentives for pharmaceutical research and development, including the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit, the orphan drug tax credit, and an enhanced deduction for charitable contributions of certain products. Nonetheless, pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to invest in developing vaccines for diseases that primarily afflict people in poor countries, because little or no paying market exists in those countries.
• Under the proposal, the seller of a qualified vaccine could claim a tax credit equal to 100 percent of the amount paid by a qualifying organization that received a �credit allocation� by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). The tax credit would match the qualified organizations� expenditures dollar-for-dollar, thereby doubling their purchasing power. A qualifying vaccine would be a new vaccine that received FDA approval for use against malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or any infectious disease that causes over 1 million deaths annually worldwide.
• For 2002 through 2010, AID could designate up to $1 billion of vaccine sales as eligible for the credit. This tax credit would be limited to new vaccines developed to fight these terrible diseases. The credit would provide a specific and credible commitment to purchase future vaccines at reasonable prices. Together with similar commitments from foundations and other governments, it would provide a critical and powerful incentive to accelerate vaccine research and development.",mainstream
897,"The Trump Executive Order (EO) on “human rights or corruption” may get some use in 2018. Anonymous sources and Washington insiders think this EO will be used to mount a counter attack against the so-called Washington Swamp and the Deep State who are trying to kick President Trump out of office. The order allows the Treasury Department to block and take assets of anyone involved in human trafficking or corruption, and this means any corruption. In short, Trump is going to war against globalists who have been selling out and ripping off America for decades. Some Intel experts say this is one of the most pivotal times in American history.

President Trump has disbanded his voter fraud commission because of heavy resistance from some very blue states such as New York and California. Trump has charged that he will not get bogged down in legal action and, instead, has turned the investigation over to Homeland Security. Is voter fraud a national security issue? According to this move by the White House—yes, it is.

On New Year’s Eve, CNN promoted drug use in the form of pot smoking to ring in the New Year. Pot became legal in the state of Colorado, and CNN was not only covering the implementation of the new law, but promoting it as a good thing. The Christian community and people like Reverend Franklin Graham think the coverage by CNN was “shameless.” It shows a morally sinking mainstream media.

630,"Coronavirus live updates: President Trump doesn't wear mask on part of trip to Michigan; Universal Orlando wants to reopen by June 1

As the world surged past the 5 million-mark in confirmed coronavirus cases Thursday, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said he can't predict whether another round of lockdowns is coming as a possible second wave of the virus looms.

Meanwhile, the U.S. pledged to spend up to $1.2 billion for an experimental COVID-19 vaccine being tested in England, and researchers said tens of thousands of American lives could have been saved if social distancing measures had been enacted only a week earlier.

On his visit to Ford in Michigan on Thursday, President Donald Trump did not wear a mask in front of photographers because he ""didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it"" although Ford officials encouraged him to wear one.

The United States accounts for 31% of the 5 million global coronavirus cases with more than 1.5 million confirmed, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard. More than 329,000 people have died globally; the U.S. death toll is more than 94,700.

Our live blog is being updated throughout the day. Refresh for the latest news, and get updates in your inbox with The Daily Briefing. Scroll down for more details.

Here are some highlights to know Thursday:
• Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, says the U.S. must be as ""overprepared as possible"" for a second wave of both lockdowns and infections.
• New research shows that 36,000 lives could have been saved if states in the U.S. had issued stay-at-home orders a week before they did.
• Universal Orlando in Florida wants to reopen as soon as June 1 with social distancing precautions like face masks, temperature checks and additional space for parking.
• At least 32 workers in an Amazon campus near Milwaukee have contracted the coronavirus in the last two months. Public health officials are worried that the company isn't tracking cases, offering tests or practicing social distancing with its workers.

Trump did not wear mask in front of photographers during trip in Michigan

Ford executives encouraged President Donald Trump to don a face mask during his visit to one of its factories Thursday, but he said he chose not to wear it near photographers because he ""didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.""

Trump, who was seen holding a navy blue mask with the presidential seal but not wearing it, said he put it on earlier in the tour. Ford officials accompanying the president were seen wearing face masks, according to reporters traveling with the president.

The president has come under scrutiny in the past for largely ignoring recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends Americans wear masks in public during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump, who notes the CDC advice is not mandatory, has described the decision as a ""personal choice.""

An Amazon warehouse worker in North Randall, Ohio, died from COVID-19, bringing the total known deaths at the company to eight employees, officials confirmed Thursday to NBC News.

The female employee went to work the same day she was diagnosed on April 30 but the company wasn't informed until May 8, an Amazon spokesperson told NBC News. The employee passed away on May 18.

""We are saddened by the loss of an associate who had worked at our site in Randall, Ohio,"" Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski told the outlet. ""Her family and loved ones are in our thoughts, and we are supporting her fellow colleagues.""

Federal regulators are investigating a Texas laboratory that a Florida hospital chain dropped last week because of delayed and unreliable COVID-19 test results.

AdventHealth, which has 45 hospitals in nine states, terminated its Florida contract with MicroGen DX due to concerns about the validity of some of the 60,000 tests MicroGen had processed for the system because the lab left them at room temperature for days, according to an AdventHealth statement. The specimens should be refrigerated at 2 to 7 degrees Celsius (about 32 degrees Fahrenheit) and then put in freezers at -70 degrees Celsius after three days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

MicroGen promotes shipping COVID-19 samples through FedEx on its website.

The company is also selling a saliva-only test that can be administered in a ""hospital, clinic, drive-thru clinic or at-home,"" in all 50 states without an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, said MicroGen spokeswoman Ashley Moore.

MicroGen CEO Rick Martin said he doesn't believe the company needs one.Martin said he was unaware of ""any inquiries into our lab,"" but added that after the AdventHealth announcement it started working with the American College of Pathologists on its testing requirements, ""which we are confident we will continue to meet.""

At least 32 workers at the Amazon campus in the city of Kenosha in Wisconsin have contracted coronavirus in the past two months, according to messages sent to employees and shared with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Amazon officials have not fully cooperated with public health workers trying to track cases, inform workers who might be at risk or offer testing and other safety measures, said Jen Freiheit, health officer for Kenosha County.

“We’re at the point now that since we’re not getting that, we’re going to look into what other measures we can take for Amazon, because we are not getting as far with compliance as we would like,” Freiheit said.

If Amazon officials do not cooperate with health officials, Freiheit said she would consider attempting to shut down the Kenosha facilities, located in Wisconsin, south of Milwaukee and north of Chicago. Amazon has not provided an official total number of cases at its Kenosha facilities to county health officials and declined to provide the number to the Journal Sentinel.

Universal Orlando wants to reopen by June 1 with coronavirus precautions

Universal Orlando asked state and local officials in Florida on Thursday to allow the theme park to reopen as soon as June 1, with precautions due to the coronavirus. The economic recovery task force in Orange County unanimously approved Universal's plan. The plan must also be approved by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

If approved, Universal Orlando could be one of the biggest theme parks in the country to reopen. Universal, Walt Disney World and SeaWorld in Florida have been closed since mid-March because of the global pandemic. A reopened Universal will look very different for visitors and employees, according to a presentation made to the local economic recovery task force Thursday by company officials.

Upon arrival, valet parking will not be available, and cars will park one or two spaces apart. Visitors and employees will receive temperature checks and will be required to wear face coverings. Universal will provide disposable face masks for visitors who don't bring their own.

Up to $1.2 billion for possible vaccine

The U.S. is betting more than $1 billion on a vaccine that does not exist. The American government has pledged to pay as much as $1.2 billion to get early access to 300 million doses of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine being developed and tested in England. The vaccine is being developed by the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute and licensed to British drugmaker AstraZeneca.

The vaccine is in early clinical trials and being tested for safety, whether it produces antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and whether it protects the immunized from becoming infected with the virus. The first tests began in England on April 23. The vaccine could be delivered as early as October but would still have to go through the completion of clinical trials before it can be administered.

The contract “is a major milestone in Operation Warp Speed’s work toward a safe, effective, widely available vaccine by 2021,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a news release.

One week could have saved 36,000 lives, researchers say

Had states across the country begun issuing stay-at-home orders just one week before they did, nearly 36,000 people would not have died and more than 700,000 positive virus cases would have been avoided, new research from Columbia University shows.

Social distancing for two weeks before when most people began staying at home could have prevented 54,000 deaths and 960,000 cases, the researchers found. Both figures are more than 57% of the current U.S. numbers in those categories.

Many states told residents to stay home in mid-March, but research indicates that by then the virus had already reached community spread in some places, like New York City. The researchers found that at least 17,500 deaths in the New York metropolitan area alone could have been prevented had social distancing measures been enacted a week earlier.

""That small moment in time, catching it in that growth phase, is incredibly critical in reducing the number of deaths,"" Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist who led the research at Columbia University, told the New York Times.

Ohio to allow weddings with up to 300 guests

Starting in June, couples getting married in Ohio will be able to invite up to 300 guests to the reception without running afoul of public health regulations.

Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said Thursday the modification to current restrictions, part of Gov. Mike DeWine's loosening of measures to combat the coronavirus, will be effective June 1. There was no word on whether the bride and groom would be allowed to get close enough to kiss, but Husted said catering and banquet facilities would have to set tables at least six feet apart.

Wedding receptions have been limited to no more than 10 people as Ohio banned large gatherings starting in mid-March.

Florida is no longer suppressing information in the table of COVID-19 deaths compiled by the state's medical examiners, according to Dr. Stephen J. Nelson, the chairman of the state's medical examiners commission.

State medical examiners are tasked with investigating and certifying COVID-19 deaths, including cause-of-death determinations. A COVID-19 positive test result is a requirement for reporting any death as due to the coronavirus.

FLORIDA TODAY, part of the USA TODAY Network, first reported that cause of death and descriptive entries of the medical examiners database were suppressed from public record in April. The Tampa Bay Times earlier in April reported that the count of the deaths by medical examiners diverged from the Department of Health's death count, at times by as much as 10%.

The timing of the reversal comes as the state faces scrutiny over data as it reopens.

CDC director noncommittal on another round of lockdowns in winter

CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield told the Financial Times that he ""can't guarantee"" whether or not a second round of stay-at-home orders is coming for the United States in the winter as the new coronavirus may see a second wave that coincides with cold weather and a flu season.

""I can't guarantee; that's kind of getting into the opinion mode. We have to be data driven,'' Redfield told the newspaper. ""What I can say is that we are committed to using the time that we have now to get this nation as overprepared as possible.""

Redfield said the spread of the virus in the southern hemisphere gives him concern about a second wave at the end of 2020 in the northern hemisphere.

About 2.4 million Americans filed initial unemployment claims last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, as the health and economic crisis sparked by the coronavirus ruptures a growing number of industries.

In just nine weeks, nearly 39 million have sought jobless benefits that represent the nation’s most reliable gauge of layoffs.

The latest claims tally was down from the 3 million who filed claims the week before, and the record 6.9 million who sought assistance in late March. Initial applications for unemployment insurance have now steadily declined seven weeks in a row.

The federal government expects a busy hurricane season for the Atlantic Basin, with six to 10 hurricanes forming, forecasters said Thursday. The announcement comes against the backdrop of the coronavirus, which will almost certainly impact evacuations and shelter from approaching storms.

Overall, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said 13 to 19 named storms will develop. This number includes tropical storms, which contain wind speeds of 39 mph or higher. Of the predicted six to 10 hurricanes, three to six could be major, packing wind speeds of 111 mph or higher.

One of the longest-serving White House employees ever died last week from COVID-19, his granddaughter told WTTG in Washington, D.C. Wilson Roosevelt Jerman, 91, started working at the White House as a cleaner in 1957, during the Eisenhower administration, granddaughter Jamila Garrett told the TV station.

First lady Jackie Kennedy promoted Jerman to become a butler, said Garrett, adding that he worked for 11 presidents and their families.

In a statement to NBC News, former President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush called Jerman ""a lovely man. He was the first person we saw in the morning when we left the residence and the last person we saw each night when we returned.""

Fauci to new doctors: We need you 'now more than ever'

""COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it spreads,"" the CDC said in updating its guidelines. ""It may be possible for COVID-19 to spread in other ways, but these are not thought to be the main ways the virus spreads.""

The CDC still warns that the main way the virus is spread is through person-to-person contact, even among those who are not showing any symptoms.

How Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive, and Destroy Reputations

Hillary Clinton “Total Terror” Descends Upon Disabled Mother Who Discovered Her Link To

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

A heartbreaking Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today details the “total terror” Hillary Clinton and her Obama regime allies have unleashed upon a disabled American mother of an autistic son who had “inadvertently/mistakenly” discovered an “electronic document” (email? photocopy?) written by the former Secretary of State authorizing a massive weapons shipment from , , to Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/Daesh) terrorists in . [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, earlier this spring the General Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) reported that they obtained a “treasure trove” of secret Islamic State documents from a Syrian village that had been retaking by Kurdish forces.

Among these documents (now classified at the highest security level) obtained by the GRU, this report continues, were detailed arrangements between the Islamic State terrorists and the US Department of State on the transferring of weapons and other war materials to Syria from Libya in exchange for payment at the Turkish-Syrian border of oil stolen from by these terrorists from both Syria and Iraq.

Upon the SVR’s examination of these Islamic State documents, as was requested by the GRU, this report continues, it was discovered that these terrorists had “electronically sent” (Twitter) a number of them to their global supporters via online social media as proof that they were being supported by the United States.

With Wikileaks having confirmed the validity of these documents proving Hillary Clinton armed these Islamic State terrorists, and US Senator Rand Paul, likewise, publically stating that she had shipped weapons to ISIS terror forces in Syria from Benghazi, and then lied about it, this report notes, none of America’s mainstream propaganda press organs have yet to tell the American people of these horrific facts.

With the “vacuum of truth” relating to Hillary Clinton’s grave crimes being created by America’s mainstream press, this report continues, it has been left to that nations independent journalists to keep the true facts flowing—and whom the Obama regime, and its propaganda press supporters, now label as “conspiracy theorists”.

So terrified, in fact, has Hillary Clinton and the Obama regime become of these independent journalists they now call “conspiracy theorists”, this report documents, top Obama official Cass Sunstein co-authored, in 2008, a report titled Conspiracy Theories: Causes and Cures telling both Obama and Hillary Clinton how to move against them—and that the secret US intelligence documents released by Edward Snowden proved was being implemented by covert American agents who had infiltrated the internet to manipulate, deceive and destroy the reputations of all dissidents considered as enemies.

To those independent journalists who couldn’t be stopped by having Obama and Hillary Clinton destroy their reputations, this report continues, they turned to methods of “total terror”—such as is currently being used against a disabled 38-year-old mother of two named Safya Roe Yassin, one of whose children is autistic.

Ms Yassin, this report explains is an American citizen born in the United States, who has never left her country, considers herself as an independent journalist, has never met a Muslim person, but was charged by the Obama regime with the grave crime of supporting ISIS—she isn’t accused of plotting a domestic attack or trying to travel overseas to join the terrorist group. she simply reported the news.

What made Ms Yassin terrifying to Hillary Clinton, however, this report says, was that she was investigating ISIS and resending to her “readers/followers” copies of “electronic documents” (Tweets) proving Clinton’s US State Department was funneling weapons to these terrorists from Libya.

This report notes that from US news reports Ms Yassin has been a longtime independent journalist investigator examining various controversial issues such as chemtrials, genetically modified foods, the dangers of vaccines as they pertain to autism, and was a frequent reader of longtime “conspiracy theory” reporters Alex Jones and David Icke.

Living as a shut-in with her father and two children in Buffalo, Missouri, this report continues, Ms Yassin rarely left home because she is severely disabled from a spinal injury and depends upon a catheter (inserted medical device for releasing urine from the bladder) in her daily life—but whom when she began re-Tweeting ISIS documents showing Hillary Clinton’s crimes in arming them, was put under daily surveillance by the FBI with them charging her, on 11 January, and her trial scheduled to start on 19 September.

SVR analysts contributing to this report state that Mr Yassin’s “motive/reason” for investigating Hillary Clinton’s links with ISIS related to her Christian belief that the “end times” might be near—and that was explained by Audrey Alexander, a researcher at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, who noted that her postings might be confusing to other ISIS supporters due to her originality: “She is questioning whether ISIL is the end of times army. That’s something that a lot of the community doesn’t necessarily latch onto, which is why we believe her views are quite well informed.”

Though Ms Yassin’s aunt, Sandra Mick, told authorities “The real story is, she’s not a terrorist. She retweeted and reposted what other people had posted, that’s the story. She’s never been outside this country. I doubt she’s even met a real Muslim”, her cousin, Janice Valenti, asserting that she is a Christian who teaches her two children Bible verses, and the US Federal Judge at her bail hearing stating “when it comes down to it, she is a disabled woman who poses no physical threat [to] herself and to anyone else”, this report sadly notes, Obama-Clinton forces have been able to keep her jailed and separated from her young children, and even worse, have still refused to turn over to her defense attorneys the evidence they claim to have against her.

To the fullest horror, however, of what Hillary Clinton has planned for Ms Yassin, this report says, is the Obama regime planning to silence her under what is called Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) that will deny her the ability to see any evidence against her, her attorneys not allowed to offer any defense of any kind, and is an exact duplicate of the Show Trials used to silence dissidents in the former Soviet Union.

Statement of Jeffrey Melhorn about his neighbor Safya Roe Yassin

To how the American people themselves are reacting to this disabled young mothers torture by Hillary Clinton, this report continues, cannot be known as the Obama regime supported press still remains silent about this case that puts all of these peoples lives in jeopardy—as now any of them who re-Tweets, or in other way, forwards information the US considers subversive can now be jailed for the rest of their lives.

As to what Hillary Clinton is most fearful about, this report says, is the American people discovering the tens-of-millions of dollars she has been given by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, the over $165 billion in arms she gave them too while Secretary of State, as the Wikileaks Cablegate emails prove, and all for the single purpose of destroying Syria and Iraq in order for these Arab states to build natural gas pipelines across in order to achieve the ultimate goal of destroying both Russia and China.

To the only hope Ms Yassin, or for that matter the American people, has, this report concludes, is Donald Trump—who this past week became the highest positioned figure in the US to join with the independent journalists truthfully telling these people that Obama-Clinton are, indeed, the founders of ISIS, and who, also, by the most accurate, and honest, accounting made yet of the upcoming presidential election, is showed to be winning by a landslide.

272,"Amid fears that Washington was planning to poach the exclusive rights for the medicine to prevent the deadly disease, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel begged the US President to “work together”. According to newspaper reporters, Mr Trump offered $1 billion to German biopharmaceutical company CureVac to secure the vaccine “only for the United States”. The EU Commission and Council leaders both spoke with their American counterpart during a G7 teleconference to discuss the global reaction to the coronavirus outbreak.

Mr Michel told reporters: “We expressed a very strong political will and we can see that it is very important to work together in order to develop therapies, to develop vaccines. “We mentioned two very concrete initiatives and a very concrete proposal, and during the video conference we felt a very strong political will in order to make progress together.” Mrs von der Leyen held separate talks with CureVac bosses in the hope of offering them a package to keep production of any coronavirus vaccines available throughout Europe.

She vowed to finance the company in their efforts to create a new medicine. “It’s crucial to find as soon as possible the vaccine that will help the whole world,” the eurocrat added. A Commission spokesman said the Brussels-based executive will “ensure this company can continue to operate in Europe”.

Meanwhile, the EU has announced plans to implement a travel ban for foreigners entering its Schengen free-travel zone. Brussels will ask European leaders to sign off on the dramatic measures during a telephone summit tomorrow. All non-essential travel into the bloc will be prevented, while plans allow for cross-border workers, medical staff and goods continue to travelling across frontiers.

The measures could be implemented as early as Wednesday if they are agreed by EU leaders. Boris Johnson has been invited to join the blanket travel ban, which would mean Britons are still able to travel into Europe for work.

107,"An Orthodox Jewish daycare has been shut by New York City’s Health Department after it violated a city order about the measles public health emergency, while 23 other daycares and yeshivas have received violation notices.

The United Talmudical Academy in the Haredi neighborhood of Williamsburg, Brooklyn failed to “provide access to medical and attendance records,” the health department said, which made it impossible to check whether the school has been excluding staff and students who aren’t vaccinated against measles.

A public health emergency was declared in four areas of Brooklyn last week to deal with the measles outbreak, the worst the city has seen since 1991. The areas affected are largely in Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities.

All children over six months of age were required to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and parents who didn’t comply could be fined $1,000. Schools were told to only accept vaccinated children and to keep medical and attendance records that authorities can have access to.

There have been 329 confirmed cases of the measles, a highly contagious disease, in New York since October, and 44 new cases since the emergency declaration last week. No deaths have been reported, but 25 have been hospitalized, with six sent to the intensive care unit. The health department is concerned more cases may occur as families gather for the upcoming Passover holiday.

Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities are showing resistance to the vaccine drive, with information circulating that the jabs are ineffective or harmful. The Orthodox Jewish anti-vaccine group Parents Educating and Advocating for Children’s Health (PEACH) claims doctors hide evidence that vaccines are linked to swelling, paralysis, and death.

Vaccinations are also the subject of a heated, wider public debate, particularly since an erroneous paper in the Lancet in 1998 claimed to have found a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The respected medical journal later retracted the publication.

Measles was essentially eradicated in the US by 2000, but there has been a spate of outbreaks as a result of people not vaccinating their children. In 2014, the Amish community in Ohio suffered an outbreak.",conspiracy

411,"Mandatory vaccinations are a highly controversial subject. For years, medical propaganda has been conditioning us to believe that vaccines provide what is known as “herd immunity.” This propaganda teaches that if a significant proportion of the population is vaccinated against a disease then the whole community will be protected, including those who do not receive the vaccine.

Based on this faulty premise, many states have passed laws making vaccinations mandatory – supposedly for the greater good of all. Many vaccine advocates go so far as to accuse those who refuse to be vaccinated of compromising the health of the entire community.

However, decades after the first vaccines were created, history has proven that these toxic jabs do not confer a lifetime of immunity, which is why booster shots are now recommended for many vaccines. And the simple fact is that in addition to being ineffective, vaccines also carry serious risks and contain dangerous and ethically questionable ingredients. Yet, more and more states are passing laws making it mandatory for children to be vaccinated, even denying school entry to those who refuse to comply.

It is therefore more important than ever to know exactly what vaccines are made of and why we need to be extremely cautious about allowing healthcare workers to administer them to our children.

There is a common misconception that being vaccinated simply entails being injected with a small amount of a disease so that the immune system can produce antibodies against it, thereby conferring lifelong immunity to the recipient.

In reality, however, vaccines are manufactured using a host of ingredients that have serious side effects. In addition, many are made with fetal cells taken from aborted babies, which would shock and horrify many of the people who willingly allow their young children to be vaccinated.

As reported by Families 4 Vaccine Choice (and confirmed by the CDC), vaccines also contain serum derived from the blood of bovine fetuses, protein from human blood plasma, kidney epithelial cells extracted from African green monkeys, yeast DNA, yeast protein, Madin Darby canine kidney cells derived from an adult cocker spaniel, chicken fibroblasts, DNA taken from porcine circoviruses and other disgusting ingredients.

Then, of course, there are the other controversial vaccine ingredients like mercury (thimerosal), formaldehyde and monosodium glutamate, which have all been linked to a host of adverse health effects.

Families 4 Vaccine Choice explains how all of these vile ingredients are used to create vaccines:

Now we learn that with RNA … “DNA molecules from two different species are inserted into a host organism to produce new genetic combinations.” So that means they are splitting human DNA with the DNA of animals and aborted fetuses and then injecting it back into our bodies with the hopes that it will cause us to create the antigen needed to immunize us against a virus.

While the government and the mainstream media promote the idea that all healthcare professionals support vaccinations, nothing could be further from the truth. Natural health practitioners like naturopathic physicians and homeopaths have long warned against the negative effects of vaccines, and even many mainstream doctors are opposed to vaccinations, especially when they are forced on people.

After all, it is a basic human right – as asserted by the American Medical Association’s Code of Medical Ethics – to choose whether or not to accept a risky medical procedure:

The patient should make his or her own determination about treatment… Informed consent is a basic policy in both ethics and law that physicians must honor, unless the patient is unconscious or otherwise incapable of consenting and harm from failure to treat is imminent.

401,"It's rare in science and science writing to make definitive statements, particularly about causation. We like to add what I call ""wishy washy"" words like ""may"" and ""probably"" and ""perhaps."" So when scientists or science writers make definitive statements like ""vaccines don't cause autism"" and ""vaccines save lives,"" it's because we have overwhelming evidence to back it up.

But 25 percent of parents in a recent University of Michigan poll agreed with the statement ""some vaccines cause autism in healthy children"" and 11.5 percent have refused at least one vaccination for their child. This is worrisome.

The now-discredited link between autism and vaccines was proposed by British scientist Andrew Wakefield in a 1998 paper in the Lancet. No one was ever able to reproduce the results of that study, and the paper has since been retracted by the journal. A recently concluded investigation of Wakefield found that he had conducted unapproved and unnecessary tests on children and even paid children at his son's birthday party for providing blood samples. Wakefield has since resigned from the autism center he began in Texas.

Other studies that have examined childhood vaccines and autism have failed to find any link. When the Institute of Medicine reviewed the issue six years ago, they concluded ""the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism"" and recommended ""a public health response that fully supports an array of vaccine safety activities.""

No one should die from a preventable disease like measles or pertussis, but they do, even here in the United States, when parents choose to leave their children unvaccinated.

Vaccines work. They don't cause autism. Now, perhaps, scientists can spend their resources on figuring out what does instead of wasting them on a debunked theory.",mainstream
626,"WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- The Senate approved the creation of a massive, Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday night in a decisive 90-9 vote.

Hours earlier, Republicans beat back a challenge to provisions Democrats had described as special favors to drug companies and other interests.

Republican leaders, fearing the Democratic amendment could derail or delay final action on the department, promised wavering GOP and Democratic moderates they would revisit some of the provisions when the 108th Congress meets next year.

The creation of the department, identified by the president as his top legislative priority of the post-election, lame-duck session, marks the biggest reorganization of the federal government in more than a half-century, throwing together more than 170,000 workers from nearly two-dozen departments and agencies.

""We are making great progress on the war on terror. Part of that progress will be the ability for us to protect the American public at home. This is a very important piece of legislation,"" Bush, who is traveling in Europe, said in a phone call with Senate Republican leaders.

He added that ""setting up this new department will take time"" but he looks forward to signing the bill.

Tom Ridge, director of the White House Office of Homeland Security, on Wednesday indicated he was ready to take the helm of the new department if asked to do so by Bush.

""I'm prepared to serve the president in whatever capacity he thinks I can serve the country,"" Ridge said on CBS' ""The Early Show.""

Sen. James Jeffords, a Vermont independent, joined eight Democrats in opposing the final bill.

The bill overcame a key hurdle earlier in the day when GOP leaders agreed to revisit controversial provisions added to the legislation just before it passed the House last week. The pledge by Sen. Minority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., helped defeat a Democratic amendment that would have stripped or modified seven separate provisions from the final bill. The Democratic amendment was defeated on a 52-47 vote.

Republicans said Democrats were mischaracterizing the provisions and warned that passage of the amendment would have derailed the creation of the new department, possibly delaying action until the Republican-controlled 108th Congress convenes in January.

Passage would have required House and Senate lawmakers to meet and iron out differences in their competing versions of the bill, which both houses would have had to approve.

Democrats said the most offensive of the provisions would shield pharmaceutical firms from suits over vaccines and their side effects, as well as wipe out those lawsuits already in court. The bill specifies that the vaccine provisions ""shall apply to all actions or proceedings pending on or after the date of enactment"" of the bill unless a court has already entered judgment.

Some Republicans said liability protection is needed to ensure that drug companies will produce vaccines needed to fight the war on terrorism.

The vaccine measure is seen as a boon to drug companies, including pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly LLY, , the developer of thimerosal, a mercury-based additive used in vaccines thought by some people to be linked to an increase in autism.

Lott said that the legislation ""was not a perfect bill,"" but that it was imperative lawmakers act quickly to get the new Homeland Security Department in place, he said.

""If we don't do it now when are we going to do it? ... The terrorists are not going to wait for a process that will go on for days or weeks or months. We have fought this fight. We need to get this done,"" Lott said.

Maine's two moderate Republican senators, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, and Sen. Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., said they voted against the amendment only after receiving assurances from Lott that he would work next year to remove three of the provisions, including one that gives protections to pharmaceutical companies that have already been sued over certain ingredients used in vaccines, the Associated Press reported.

Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., one of three Democrats to vote with Republicans, said he had received similar assurances.

Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Democrats would press to remove the provisions next year, but said he was ""dubious"" of GOP promises to revisit the measures.

""I have to say, if they are so bad, why didn't they take them out now, you know? Why wait? I think it's always harder to take things out than to put them in, and it will get even harder as we go into the next Congress,"" he said.

Both sides had anticipated a close vote. The Senate currently is divided 49-49 between Republicans and Democrats, with two independents, but the GOP will regain in the next Congress a majority in the Senate and have a slightly wider edge in the House, courtesy of the Nov. 5 midterm elections.

Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who faces a tough run-off battle with Republican Suzanne Terrell on Dec. 7, also voted with Republicans, along with Zell Miller of Georgia, one of the bill's co-sponsors.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was the only Republican to vote with Democrats. The Senate's two independents split their votes, with Vermont's James Jeffords voting with Democrats and Minnesota's Dean Barkley voting with Republicans. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., missed the vote. He was attending a Paris fashion tribute to the late Jacqueline Kennedy, the Associated Press reported. See how your senator voted.

The House initially passed a homeland security bill in July, but Senate action stalled amid Democratic objections over provisions dealing with worker protections. Republicans used the issue in the Nov. 5 midterm elections. Democrats largely yielded to the administration on the worker provisions after the election.

In debating the Democratic amendment, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, told senators that most of the seven provisions at issue strengthened the bill. Moreover, passage of the amendment would require a conference committee to reconcile differences with the House's version of the homeland bill, something that could at worst derail the entire bill and at best force lawmakers to return in December.

Daschle, D-S.D., on the Senate floor, accused House Republicans of inserting the measures at the last minute in ""an atrocious demeaning of the legislative process.""

The Washington Post on Tuesday said President Bush had called at least two wavering senators in an effort to defeat the amendment.

Other provisions targeted by the Democratic amendment were liability shields for airport security firms and businesses that market anti-terrorism technologies, and a measure to narrow provisions restricting government contracts with companies that have moved their headquarters overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes.

The amendment also targeted a provision that Democrats said was intended to ensure that Texas A&M University gets funding for a homeland-security research center.",mainstream
145,"German Medical Doctor Katrin Korb discusses COVID-19, the lockdown and the vaccine during a protest held in Oldeburg.

Below is the transcript of her speech.

I’m thankful for being able to stand here today. My name is Katrin Korb, I have 3 children and I’m a doctor here in Oldenburg.

I’m standing here because I feel the responsibility for the health of my parents, my children and myself.

I stand here because I am furious about the attempts to get more control over people, by attacking them with fear. I am not sure what happens exactly, though I’m sure it has to do with money and power.

Firstly, I recognize this principle. It’s the principle of our health-care system! A system which unfortunately is guilty of spreading fear in order to earn money. This fear is on both our sides, my side as a doctor, but also my patients.

There are guidelines I have to follow, guidelines for various health problems. But who is writing these guidelines?

I will give you an example: There is a European guideline for heart diseases. There are 25 different authors who draft these guidelines, 19 of which are funded by the pharmaceutical industry. They call it an ‘advisory fee’.

The guidelines state that I must prescribe medications that have a lot of side effects but that do not make people better. This makes a lot of money. If I don’t follow these guidelines and something happens to these people; for example, the situation is deteriorating for whatever reason, then I will be held responsible for that. So, fear is cultivated so that I have to act against my professional beliefs.

The sick people are also frightened; “if you do not take these pills you will have a heart attack”. “Then you will become even sicker”. “Listen to me; I can know, I studied for it.” “You are not sensible enough to think for yourself”. “There is therefore no room to discuss this.”

As a result, people fear taking this medication day after day, week to week, year to year, which makes a lot of money. That’s the way.

Since the beginning of this corona virus, we have been kept in a kind of shock from the frightening messages. Our governments say there is a new virus so terribly dangerous that millions will die, if we don’t protect you! “We know best what is good for you because we have experts.” You cannot make a decision for yourself. You are too stupid for that. ”We have to isolate you, take away your rights and silent you by putting on a muzzle. But we really do this for your protection”. “We frighten you so much every day through the most horrible reports that you won’t even dare to ask yourself if it’s all right”.

The mantra of the authorities is: Only when we have a vaccination can we return to “a normal”.

In other words, only a vaccination can give us back our fundamental rights.

This week, Mrs. von den Leyen (EU) has collected E 7.4 billion worldwide for the development and distribution of such a vaccine. Also Germany has paid E525,000. Normally, the development of such a vaccination takes years. That’s because security investigations need to be done.

This new virus from the corona family was discovered less than six months ago but experiments with “MRNA” are already being tried on humans. This is unknown genetic material that will be injected into our cells. You don’t have to be a doctor to get an ominous feeling about this. I will not be vaccinated, I will not get my children vaccinated, and I will also advise my patients not to do this!

Paragraph Two of the Constitution does NOT specify: RIGHT TO HEALTH but right to physical integrity. That is a very big difference. So there is no right to health!

Being sick is part of our human life, but no one should inflict physical harm on us even with a dubious vaccine.

We are the ones paying for this. We already pay for the scientific and social impact of the lockdowns. OUR TAX MONEY is spent for this. And a vaccine must be financed with our tax money! Already E 525 million German tax money and this is only the beginning. Are we being asked if we want to do this? Are we asked if we want to pay for Lockdowns? NO!

All this money, the taxes we’ve paid, we want that to be spent on other things. For good education for our children, for the development of new technologies for the environment, for decent wages for employees in our “vital” professionals. For immigration of people who fled from the war. For sports, culture, etc., etc… This list is endless. In short, for things that make and keep people healthy. But with this no money can be made.

We are in a crisis. What is the way out of this crisis?

The victory over fear is the way out of this crisis.

People who can think for themselves, being creative, take responsibility for themselves working on their own health and the health of our world.

People who are positive, who have friends, who enjoy life, do not get sick easily.

And if they do get sick, they eventually unite with death.

Knowing that life in this world will ever end and are at peace with it.

You can’t scare these kinds of people.

You have no power over these people.

This body has only been borrowed and someday I will have to give it back.

But as long as I live in this body, as long as I feel, think and act, it will be MY body! I am responsible for that and no one else. MY BODY, which I treat in the way I think is right.

I do not wish to return to the old normal. I wish for a new better normal. With free and self-determined people, who are responsible for themselves. I believe many of us are here together with the same wish.

This gives me hope and I thank you.

818,"A single sperm donor is the biological father of at least 12 children who all developed — an extraordinary case that prompted one woman to sue her sperm bank, according to news reports.

The case came to light when the woman, Danielle Rizzo of Illinois, was researching treatments for her two sons, who both have autism, according to . Both sons were conceived with sperm from the same donor, and Rizzo was shocked to discover that other mothers who used the same donor also had sons with autism, the Post reported.

Rizzo was told that the likelihood of all these related children having autism by chance was like all the mothers ""opening up a dictionary and pointing to the same letter of the same word on the same page at the same time,"" she told the Post.

That means a mutation in the donor's sperm was likely responsible. But is there a single ""autism gene?""

In short, no: There are hundreds of genetic variations tied to autism spectrum disorder, according to the . In most cases, these mutations increase a person's risk of autism, but they don't destine someone to develop the condition. In other words, genes typically play only a partial role in the risk of developing autism, with environmental factors, such as the parents' ages and birth complications, contributing as well.

But in rare cases, genetic mutations are thought to be the main cause of autism. Only about 2% to 4% of people with autism have these mutations, according to the NIH.

""We call autism one thing, but it's different in every person. In some, it's all about the genes. Some it's a combination of genes and the environment. Some people, it's unknown,"" Dr. Wendy Chung, a professor of pediatric medicine at Columbia University, told the Post.

Studies of Rizzo's children found that they had two mutations tied to autism in genes called MBD1 and SHANK1.

Most reproductive clinics test for several hundred genetic conditions, but there is no test for autism, The Post reported.

In Rizzo's lawsuit, she alleged that the donor's profile had false information. For example, she said that the donor did not have a college degree, as the profile listed, and that he had been , which was omitted from the profile, the Post reported. She settled the lawsuit in March for $250,000.

790,"The hope is that we will have a coronavirus vaccine in 12-18 months, but for that to happen we may have to rely on untested techniques - and that comes with its own risks.

POTTERING around her kitchen on the morning of 31 December, Kate Broderick scrolled through the headlines while she waited for her tea to brew. One story caught her eye: a mysterious outbreak of severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Nearly overnight, the number of cases seemed to explode. “I knew we didn’t have time to wait,” she says.

A molecular geneticist at Inovio Pharmaceuticals in California, Broderick was poised for what came next. When Chinese officials published the genetic sequence of the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus causing the illness just two weeks after the first cases were reported to the World Health Organization, Broderick got to work. Within 3 hours, her team had a prototype vaccine ready for initial testing. It was an unprecedented turnaround, but a moment Broderick and many others had long seen coming.

Making vaccines usually takes a decade or more between development, safety testing and manufacturing, says Seth Berkley, head of Gavi, an international group that promotes vaccine use around the world. With global confirmed cases of the new disease, covid-19, surging past 180,000 at the time of writing, time is of the essence.

To speed things up, scientists are turning to untested classes of vaccines, and rethinking every part of how they are designed, evaluated and manufactured. If the approach works, we will, for the first time, have identified a new disease and developed a vaccine against it while the initial outbreak is still ongoing.

In addition to the two vaccine efforts, Merck is collaborating with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to create an oral antiviral treatment for the virus. Clinical studies for the two vaccines are expected to start later in 2020, according to press statements. Shares of Merck jumped over 4% before the morning bell.

“COVID-19 is a global challenge and requires global solutions,” said Merck chairman and chief executive Kenneth C. Frazier in a statement. “Merck intends to make any vaccine or medicine we develop for this pandemic broadly accessible and affordable globally, and we are working now to accomplish this goal as quickly as possible.”

One. That’s the number of doses Merck is ultimately aiming for in either Covid-19 vaccine. Roger Perlmutter, the head of Merck’s Research Laboratories, told Stat News that having to give booster shots would make immunizing people more difficult.

According to Stat News, Merck’s efforts against Covid-19 have been going on behind the scenes for at least two and a half months prior to its announcements Tuesday. In that space of time, other companies—including Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax—have announced their efforts to create a vaccine, and are in varying stages of development. Although the World Health Organization says over 100 vaccines are in the works, with some promising early trial results, experts like National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci have expressed caution. 12 to 18 months is the timeline in which most health officials agree a safe vaccine could be made available.

1196,"There is no link between the measles, mumps and rubella jab and autism, according to the latest research.

The Danish study, which looked at over 530,000 children, reinforces previous findings that there is no link between the jab and the condition.

It found the risk of autism was the same for children who had been vaccinated as those who had not.

There was also no cluster of autism cases seen at any time after immunisation.

And no kind of autistic disorder was linked to the MMR jab.

Four years ago, Finnish scientists carried out a study based on 14 years worth of data, which ruled out a link between MMR and autism, or a chronic bowel inflammation.

Experts say this latest study reinforces those findings.

But it is accepted that some parents still have concerns over the vaccine's safety.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at all children born in January 1991 until December 1998.

Over 440,000 children who had been given the MMR vaccine and over 100,000 who had not.

No increased risk was linked to MMR.

The researchers, led by Dr Kreesten Meldgaard Madsen, wrote: ""One of the main reasons for public concern has been that the widespread use of the MMR vaccine in some regions appeared to coincide with an increase in the incidence of autism.

""However, this is not a uniform finding.

""The increase in autism both in California and in Denmark occurred well after the introduction of the MMR vaccine.""

But in the New England Journal, editor Dr Edward Campion, said: ""Unfortunately, objective data are not likely to put an end to the controversy.

But he added: ""Those arguing against vaccination forget how bad the illnesses and their complications can be.

""Children everywhere deserve the protection that carefully developed, carefully monitored vaccines can provide against so much disease.""

A spokesperson for the Public Health Laboratory Service, which covers England and Wales, said: ""It is interesting research that adds yet further weight of evidence against the hypothesis that MMR causes autism"".

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""This large, peer-reviewed study from Denmark, undertaken by independent researchers and published in the internationally respected New England Journal of Medicine adds to the increasing body of research from around the world which has found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.""",mainstream

1135,"Lest Siberian excavation makes you think of frozen woolly mammoths, make no mistake: These giants are still decidedly microscopic. But in the diminutive world of viruses they're larger than normal specimens, measuring 1.5 microns in length and 0.5 microns in diameter. The pandoraviruses, the largest viruses previously discovered, also by the team of Claverie and Abergel, measure 1 micron in length and 0.5 in diameter.

Amazingly, even after more than 30,000 years embedded in ancient permafrost, when Claverie and Abergel exposed amoebas in their lab to the virus, they found that the virus was still active and quickly infected the host cell. ""We use amoeba on purpose as a safe bait for capturing viruses. We then immediately verify that they are not able to infect animal/human cells,"" stressed the researchers.

Giant viruses are not just bigger but are hardier than others as well, said the researchers. This hardiness, along with a favorable environment, likely helped the newly discovered specimen stay intact for the thousands of years that it did. Viruses are often destroyed or rendered inactive by a number of factors, including light and biochemical degradation.

""Among known viruses, the giant viruses tend to be very tough, almost impossible to break open,"" said Claverie and Abergel. ""Special environments such as deep ocean sediments and permafrost are very good preservers of microbes [and viruses] because they are cold, anoxic [lacking oxygen], and in the dark.""

The past decade has seen something of a renaissance in the discovery of large, genetically complex viruses, with the discovery of three distinct groups (Mimivirus, Pandoravirus, and now Pithovirus) suggesting that viruses can be much more intricate and varied than previously thought, and that giant viruses may not be especially uncommon.

If long-buried viruses can be unearthed, what else might be capable of coming to the surface? Climate change as well as industrial activities may shake up the ancient ice enough to bring potential pathogens to the surface.

""The idea would make a great movie but is extremely unlikely unless the virus came from a frozen human being who possibly died from a virus that is no longer in circulation,"" said Mocarski when contacted via email.

""The biggest source of genes on the planet is probably from viruses, and they're just everywhere, but in general they're highly specific for the organisms that they grow in,"" said Van Etten.

The researchers behind the discovery, Claverie and Abergel, believe that whether or not it's likely, such a scenario remains feasible. They counsel vigilance and continued testing. As their latest research has shown, large DNA viruses may remain infectious for very long stretches of time.

""The fact that we might catch a viral infection from a long-extinct Neanderthal individual is a good demonstration that the notion that a virus could be 'eradicated' from the planet is plain wrong and gives us a false sense of security. At least a stock of vaccine should be kept, just in case,"" said Claverie and Abergel.

""We are now doing more work to analyze the DNA content of these permafrost layers in a search for the genetic signature of viruses resembling human pathogens,"" said Claverie and Abergel, who stressed that they are not attempting to ""revive"" any such pathogenic viruses, but rather hoping to determine the potential danger.",mainstream
1280,"A vaccine adverse event, sometimes referred to as a vaccine injury, is an adverse event caused by vaccination. Most vaccine adverse events are mild; serious injuries and deaths caused by vaccines are very rare, and the idea that severe events are common has been classed as a ""common misconception about immunization"" by the World Health Organization.[1] Some claimed vaccine injuries are not, in fact, caused by vaccines; for example, there is a subculture of advocates who attribute their children’s autism to vaccine injury,[2] despite the fact that vaccines do not cause autism.[3][4]

Claims of vaccine injuries appeared in litigation in the United States in the latter part of the 20th Century. Some families have won substantial awards from sympathetic juries, even though many public health officials have said that the claims of injuries are unfounded.[5] In response, several vaccine makers stopped production, threatening public health, and laws were passed to shield makers from liabilities stemming from vaccine injury claims.[5]

Anti-vaccination websites greatly exaggerate the risk of serious adverse effects from vaccines and falsely describe conditions such as autism and shaken baby syndrome as vaccine injuries,[6][7][8] leading to misconceptions about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.[9][10] This has had the result of stigmatizing autistic people and the parents who had them immunized.[11]

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while ""[a]ny vaccine can cause side effects"",[12] most side effects are minor, primarily including sore arms or a mild fever.[12] Immunization safety is taken very seriously by the scientific community, with constant monitoring of a number of data sources looking for patterns of adverse events.[13]

As the success of immunization programs increases and the incidence of disease decreases, public attention shifts away from the risks of disease to the risk of vaccination.[14] Unlike most medical interventions vaccines are given to healthy people. Concerns about immunization safety often follow a pattern.[14] First, some investigators suggest that a medical condition of increasing prevalence or unknown cause is due to an adverse effect of vaccination. The initial study, and subsequent studies by the same investigators, have inadequate methodology, typically a poorly controlled or uncontrolled case series.[14] A premature announcement is made of the alleged adverse effect, which resonates with individuals suffering from the condition and which underestimates the potential harm of not being vaccinated. The initial study is not reproduced by other investigators.[14] Finally, it takes several years before the public regains confidence in the vaccine.[14]

Controversies in this area revolve around the question of whether the risks of adverse events following immunization outweigh the benefits of preventing infectious disease. In rare cases immunizations can cause serious adverse effects, such as gelatin measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) causing anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction.[14] Allegations particularly focus on disorders claimed to be caused by the MMR vaccine and thiomersal, a preservative used in vaccines routinely given to U.S. infants prior to 2001. Current scientific evidence does not support claims of vaccines causing the various disorders cited in the claims.[15][16]

The debate is complicated by misconceptions around the recording and reporting of adverse events by anti-vaccination activists.[17]

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is unusual in that it contains a live attenuated virus that can be excreted leading, under-vaccinated communities, to secondary infection.[18] Since 2000, more than 10 billion doses of OPV have been administered to nearly 3 billion children worldwide. During that time, 24 vaccine-derived polio outbreaks occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 cases.[18] Polio vaccine was also involved in the only large-scale outbreak of vaccine induced disease, in the Cutter incident. It is likely that polio will not be eradicated until OPV is fully replaced with inactivated vaccines.[19]

Many countries, including Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United States have specific requirements for reporting vaccine-related adverse effects, while other countries including Australia, France, and the United Kingdom include vaccines under their general requirements for reporting injuries associated with medical treatments.[20]:8–11 A number of countries have programs for the compensation of injuries alleged to have been caused by a vaccination.[20]:9–44

In 1988, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) went into effect to compensate individuals and families of individuals who have been injured by specified childhood vaccines.[21] The VICP was adopted in response to an earlier scare over the pertussis portion of the DPT vaccine. These claims were later generally discredited, but some U.S. lawsuits against vaccine makers won substantial awards; most makers ceased production, and the last remaining major manufacturer threatened to do so.[22] As of October 2019, $4.2 Billion in compensation (not including attorneys fees and costs) has been awarded.[23]

VICP uses a streamlined system for litigating vaccine injury claims under which the claimant must show that the vaccine caused the injury, but just as in litigation for injury by any other product, he is not required to establish it was anyone’s fault (i.e. negligence need not be proven)[24] Claims that are denied can be pursued through civil lawsuits, though this is rare, and the statute creating the VICP also imposes substantial limitations on the ability to pursue such lawsuits. The VICP covers all vaccines listed on the Vaccine Injury Table[25] which is maintained by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. To win an award, a claimant is required to show a causal connection between an injury and one of the vaccines listed in the Vaccine Injury Table. Compensation is payable for ""table"" injuries, those listed in the Vaccine Injury Table, as well as, ""non-table"" injuries, injuries not listed in the table.[26]

In addition, an award may only be given if the claimant’s injury lasted for more than 6 months after the vaccine was given, resulted in a hospital stay and surgery or resulted in death. Awards are based on medical expenses, lost earnings and pain and suffering (capped at $250,000).[27]

From 1988 until March 3, 2011, 5,636 claims relating to autism, and 8,119 non-autism claims, were made to the VICP. 2,620 of these claims, one autism-related, were compensated, with 4,463 non-autism and 814 autism claims dismissed; awards (including attorney's fees) totaled over $2 billion. The VICP also applies to claims for injuries suffered before 1988; there were 4,264 of these claims of which 1,189 were compensated with awards totaling $903 million.[25] As of October 2019, $4.2 billion in compensation (not including attorneys fees and costs) has been awarded over the life of the program.[28]

As part of NVICP, a table has been created which lists various vaccines, side effects that might plausibly be caused by them, and the time within which the symptoms must present in order to be eligible to apply for compensation.[29][30]

For example, for vaccines containing tetanus toxoid (e.g., DTaP, DTP, DT, Td, or TT), anaphylaxis within four hours or brachial neuritis between two and twenty-eight days after administration, may be compensated.[31]

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a passive surveillance program administered jointly by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[citation needed]

VAERS is intended to track adverse events associated with vaccines. VAERS collects and analyzes information from reports of adverse events (possible side effects) that occur after the administration of US licensed vaccines. The program's success in tracking vaccine injuries has been questioned by some, who allege medical practitioners frequently fail to make reports.[32] Others say that it may overstate possible injuries since many neurological problems in childhood may manifest around the same ages when vaccines are routinely administered.[citation needed] Dravet syndrome is one example of a genetically based neurological disease which frequently manifests at the time of childhood vaccinations.[33]

The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) is composed of databases from several organizations containing information regarding health outcomes for millions of US citizens and to enhance assessment of vaccine injuries. It was designed to allow for such things as comparisons between vaccinated and non-vaccinated populations, and for the identification of possible groups at risk for adverse events.[citation needed]

In 2003, parents of over 1,000 United Kingdom children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, alleging the MMR vaccine was the culprit, were dealt a major setback when the Legal Services Commission withdrew legal aid. This followed advice to the commission by the lawyers representing the parents themselves that the lawsuit had no reasonable prospects of success.[34]

Under the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS), it is thought that thousands of unsuccessful claims have been made. The maximum payment per claim is currently £120,000. Disabled vaccine injury patients are allowed to file a claim up to the age of 21. The 'disability threshold' before payments are granted is 60%. The scheme covers vaccinations for illnesses such as tetanus, measles, tuberculosis, and meningitis C. As of 2005, the British government had paid out £3.5 million to vaccine injury patients since 1997.[35]

Quebec has a legal process to compensate certain forms of vaccination injuries; the program's first awards were made in 1988.[36]",mainstream
1068,"In the early 1950s, two prominent medical researchers each found a way to protect the world from poliomyelitis, the paralysis-causing disease commonly known as polio. The vaccines created by Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr. Albert Sabin resulted in the near-global eradication of polio. Here's how they did it.

Polio is a disease caused by three variants of the poliovirus, according to a 2012 review written by microbiologist and polio expert Anda Baicus and published in the World Journal of Virology. The virus, which only infects humans, can damage the neurons that control movement, resulting in partial or complete paralysis. A person can become infected with the virus by consuming contaminated food or water, or by allowing contaminated items (such as dirty hands) to touch or enter the mouth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Studies of Egyptian mummies suggest that polio affected children at least as early as ancient times, but the U.S. didn't experience its first polio epidemic until the late 1800s. In the U.S. in 1916, more than 27,000 people were paralyzed by the disease and at least 6,000 people died from it, according to History.com. For the next several decades, the epidemic expanded throughout the U.S. and Europe. In 1952 alone, there were 58,000 new cases of polio and 3,000 deaths from the disease in the U.S.

As medical experts worked to understand the virus, they discovered that it could infect people without causing symptoms. In a 1947 study published in the American Journal of Hygiene, researchers reported that the prevalence of poliovirus in New York City sewage water meant that there were an estimated 100 asymptomatic cases of polio for every symptomatic, or paralytic, case of the disease at the time. Today, more recent research suggests that 72 out of 100 people who are infected with the virus will never experience symptoms, and about 1 in 4 infected people will experience only flu-like symptoms that last between 2 and 5 days before going away on their own, according to the CDC.

In the late 1930s, researchers learned that infected individuals shed the virus in feces for several weeks, whether or not they had symptoms of the disease. Researchers have since confirmed that infected, but asymptomatic, people can still shed the virus and make people sick. People who do become sick can shed the virus immediately before they show symptoms and for up to 2 weeks after their symptoms appear, according to the CDC.

Researchers began working on a polio vaccine in the 1930s, but early attempts were unsuccessful. An effective vaccine didn't come around until 1953, when Jonas Salk introduced his inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).

Salk had studied viruses as a student at New York University in the 1930s and helped develop flu vaccines during World War II, according to History.com. In 1948, he was awarded a research grant from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, later named March of Dimes. Roosevelt had contracted polio in 1921 at age 39, and the disease left him with both legs permanently paralyzed. In 1938, five years into his presidency, Roosevelt helped to create the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis to raise money and deliver aid to areas experiencing polio epidemics.

Thanks to the work of researchers before him, Salk was able to grow poliovirus in monkey kidney cells. He then isolated the virus and inactivated it with formalin, an organic solution of formaldehyde and water that is commonly used as a disinfectant and embalming agent. A similar procedure had been tested years prior, in 1935, by American scientist Maurice Brodie, in which he extracted poliovirus from live monkey spinal cord tissue and then suspended the virus in a 10% formalin solution, polio expert Baicus wrote. Brodie tested his vaccine on 20 monkeys and then on 300 schoolchildren, but the results were poor and Brodie didn't test any further.

Salk's vaccine was unusual because instead of using a weakened version of the live virus, such as what is used for mumps and measles, Salk's vaccine used a ""killed,"" or inactivated, version of the virus. When the ""dead"" poliovirus is injected into the bloodstream, it can't cause an infection because the virus is inactive; but the immune system can't distinguish an activated virus from an inactivated one, and it creates antibodies to fight the virus. Those antibodies persist and protect the person from future poliovirus infection.

In 1953, Salk began testing his inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) on a small number of former polio patients in the Pittsburgh area and on himself, his wife and their three sons. The initial results were promising, and he announced his success on the CBS national radio network on March 25, 1953, according to History.com. He became an instant celebrity.

The first large-scale clinical trial of Salk's vaccine began in 1954 and enrolled more than 1 million participants. It was the first vaccine trial to implement a double-blind, placebo-controlled design — now a standard requirement in the modern era of vaccine research, according to Arnold S. Monto's 1999 review published in the journal Epidemiological Reviews.

The scientist leading the vaccine trial, Dr. Thomas Francis, Jr. from the University of Michigan, announced the positive results at a press conference on April 12, 1955. Later that same day, the U.S. government declared Salk's vaccine safe and effective for use, according to The College of Physicians of Philadelphia's History of Vaccines.

Related: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history

After the press conference, CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow asked Salk who owned the vaccine. ""Well the people, I would say,"" Salk famously answered. ""There is no patent. Can you patent the sun?"" Salk never patented his vaccine.

Only a few weeks later, reports began surfacing of children experiencing paralysis after receiving the vaccine. More than 250 new polio cases were traced back to batches of the vaccine made by Cutter Laboratories, according to the CDC. The batches had contained live, active strains of poliovirus.

The U.S. Surgeon General halted all polio vaccine administration until all manufacturers could be investigated and verified for safety. At the time, there had been little government regulation over vaccine manufacturers, but that quickly changed after what is now known as the Cutter Incident. Since then, not a single case of polio has ever been attributed to the Salk vaccine.

While Salk was developing his inactivated polio vaccine, his professional rival, virologist Dr. Albert Sabin at the University of Cincinnati, was working on a vaccine made with active, but weakened, virus. Sabin opposed Salk's vaccine design and considered an inactivated virus vaccine to be dangerous.

By 1963, Sabin had created an oral live-virus vaccine for all three types of poliovirus that was approved for use by the U.S. government. Sabin's version was cheaper and easier to produce than the Salk vaccine, and it quickly supplanted the Salk vaccine in the U.S. In 1972, Sabin donated his vaccine strains to the World Health Organization (WHO), which greatly increased the vaccine's availability in low-income countries.

Sabin's oral polio vaccine (OPV) was critical for helping to decrease the number of polio cases globally, but unlike the Salk vaccine — which carries no risk of paralysis — the OPV carries an extremely small risk of causing paralysis. Today, the WHO estimates that about 1 in 2.7 million doses of OPV result in paralytic polio.

Since 2000, Salk's inactivated polio vaccine is the only version administered in the U.S., in order to avoid any risk of vaccine-induced polio associated with OPV. The OPV is still administered in many parts of the world, but the WHO's Global Polio Eradication Initiative aims to cease the administration of OPV altogether once wild (non vaccine-related) polio is completely eradicated.

The CDC now recommends children receive four doses of IPV, one each at ages 2 months, 4 months, between 6 and 18 months, and between 4 and 6 years. Thanks to widespread use of the polio vaccine, the U.S. has been polio-free since 1979. Globally, cases of polio due to wild poliovirus have decreased by 99% since 1988, according to the WHO, from an estimated 350,000 cases per year to just 33 new cases in 2018.

39,"What Are Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis?

The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine protects against:
• Diphtheria: a serious infection of the throat that can block the airway and cause severe breathing problems
• Tetanus (lockjaw): a nerve disease that can happen at any age, caused by toxin-producing bacteria contaminating a wound
• Pertussis (whooping cough): a respiratory illness with cold-like symptoms that lead to severe coughing (the ""whooping"" sound happens when a child breathes in deeply after a severe coughing fit). Serious complications can affect children under 1 year old, and those younger than 6 months old are especially at risk. Teens and adults with a lasting cough might have pertussis and not realize it, and could pass it to vulnerable infants.

DTaP immunizations are given as a series of 5 injections, usually given at ages:

A vaccine called Tdap (the booster shot) should be given at ages 11 to 12, and to older teens and adults who haven't yet had a booster with pertussis coverage. (This is especially important for adults who will be around newborn babies, such as grandparents or other caregivers.) Then, Td (tetanus and diphtheria) boosters are recommended every 10 years.

Pregnant women should get the Tdap vaccine in the second half of each pregnancy, even if they've been vaccinated in the past. Tdap also can be given after a deep cut or severe burn to prevent tetanus infection.

Why Is the DTaP Vaccine Recommended?

Use of the DTaP vaccine has virtually eliminated diphtheria and tetanus in childhood and has greatly reduced the number of pertussis cases.

The vaccine can cause mild side effects: fever; mild crankiness; tiredness; loss of appetite; and tenderness, redness, or swelling in the area where the shot was given.

Rarely, a child may have a seizure, a high fever, or uncontrollable crying after getting the vaccine. But these sorts of side effects are so rare that researchers question whether they're even caused by the vaccine. Most kids have a few minor or no side effects.

When to Delay or Avoid DTaP Immunization

Simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization, but your doctor might choose to reschedule the vaccine if your child has a more serious illness.

Talk to your doctor about whether getting the vaccine is a good idea if your child had any of the following after an earlier DTaP shot:
• a brain or nervous-system problem, like coma or seizures
• severe pain or swelling of a whole arm or leg

Your doctor might give a partial vaccine or no vaccine, or may decide that the benefits of vaccinating your child outweigh the potential risks.

Caring for Your Child After DTaP Immunization

Your child may have a fever, soreness, and some swelling and redness in the area where the shot was given. For pain and fever, check with your doctor to see if you can give either acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and to find out the right dose.

A warm, damp cloth or a heating pad on the injection site may help reduce soreness, as can moving or using the arm.

When Should I Call the Doctor?
• Call if you aren't sure whether the vaccine should be postponed or avoided. Children who have had certain problems with the DTaP vaccine usually can safely receive the Td (tetanus and diphtheria) vaccine.
• Call if anything concerns you after immunization.",mainstream
698,"In light of President Obama’s declaration that the outbreak of the H1N1 virus is a national emergency, Surprising Science is setting this week aside to discuss the history and science of vaccines and their importance in battling diseases, including swine flu. See Monday’s post for part 1, A Brief History and How Vaccines Work, and yesterday for part 2, Success Stories.

It’s kind of startling that the idea of vaccines ever caught on. There is an amazing amount of trust needed: A person—often a complete stranger—is injecting you with a foreign substance. You have to trust that the substance is really what you’ve been told it is, that it has been sufficiently tested and is safe, and that it will work as advertised and not hurt you.

Despite this, most people trust the doctors, science and government and do get vaccinated. A small percentage, however, choose not to be vaccinated (or not to have their children vaccinated). And it’s been this way almost since Edward Jenner first began vaccinating people against smallpox (see the illustration).

Decades after Jenner’s discovery, the British government got involved in vaccination by passing a law in 1840 that provided free smallpox vaccinations to the poor. But later efforts didn’t go over so well. A 1853 law required all infants be vaccinated in the first three months of life and threatened parents who did not vaccinate their children with a fine or imprisonment. Riots soon broke out in several towns. In London, an Anti-Vaccination League was founded. In 1867, after the law was extended to children up to age 14, the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League was founded. Opposition now focused on the law’s threat to personal liberty. (“As parliament, instead of guarding the liberty of the subject, has invaded this liberty by rendering good health a crime…parliament is deserving of public condemnation.”)

In the late 19th century, anti-vaccination movements spread across Europe and into the United States, where they succeeded in repealing compulsory vaccination laws in several western and Midwest states.

But despite the controversy, protests and pamphlets, the doctors, science and governments eradicated smallpox from the United States by 1950 and from the entire world by 1980.

Along the way, though, anti-vaccination sentiments have resulted in serious harm. For example, when the majority of the residents of Stockholm, Sweden refused vaccination for smallpox in the early 1870s, they were left vulnerable to the disease. The city experienced a major epidemic in 1874, after which vaccination was again popular.

Efforts to eradicate polio—a disease now confined to just a few countries—came off track in Nigeria due to a 2004 rumor that the vaccine “contained birth control drugs as part of a secret western plot to reduce population growth in the Muslim world.” Polio is on the rise again in Nigeria, and more than 100 children have been left paralyzed by the disease this year.

And in places like Europe, Australia and the United States, in communities where parents have stopped vaccinating their children for fear that common childhood immunization causes autism (a fear that is completely unfounded), diseases that had become rare—like measles and pertussis—are making a comeback, as Wired magazine notes in their November issue:

The anti-vaccination movement ebbs and flows over time, with fear of disease fighting mistrust of doctors, science and government. Which will win? If history is any guide: neither. But doctors, science and government will all need to work together to find a way to protect public health. And then, perhaps, they will find more vaccine success stories along the way.",mainstream
1087,"It is a common myth today that the vaccines administered to children no longer contain the toxic additive thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative linked to causing permanent neurological damage. But a recent federal case involving the U.S.Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has revealed that, contrary to this widely-held belief, thimerosal is actually still present in many batch vaccines, including in the annual influenza vaccine that is now administered to children as young as six months old.

Filed by a citizen-backed coalition advocating vaccine safety, the lawsuit against the FDA alleged that the agency’s continued endorsement and approval of thimerosal as a vaccine additive is a serious public health threat, especially since safer alternatives already exist and are widely used voluntarily by many vaccine manufacturers. But Judge Brett Kavanaugh, siding with antiquated pseudoscience, decided that thimerosal is not a health threat, and that those who wish to avoid it can simply choose thimerosal-free alternatives.

Ignoring the evidence of thimerosal’s dangers brought before him on behalf of the millions of children across the country who continue to be injected with this mercury-based additive, Judge Kavanaugh declared that the plaintiffs, which include groups like theCoalition for Mercury-Free Drugs(CMFD), did not have proper standing to file the lawsuit. And in the process, both he and the FDA inadvertently admitted that thimerosal is still present in many childhood vaccines, which counters popular claims to the contrary.

FDA admits on its website that thimerosal is still in vaccines

The fact that Judge Kavanaugh refused to hear the case is tragic in and of itself, as thimerosal, which is composed of 50 percent mercury, has been proven to cause serious health damage. But what may be even worse is the fact that many people falsely believe that thimerosal is not even included in vaccines anymore, which is leading them to blindly allow them to be administered to their children. And the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA have continued to provide dubious and misleading information on the subject, which the mainstream media has been complicit in spreading over the years.

But the FDA explains, in no uncertain terms, directly on its website that thimerosal is still added to certain vaccines. For this reason alone, it is crucial that parents who choose to vaccinate their children ask for an ingredients list for each and every vaccine before allowing them to be administered to their children.

“While the use of mercury-containing preservatives has declined in recent years with the development of new products formulated with alternative or no preservatives, thimerosal has been used in some immune globulin preparations, anti-venins, skin test antigens, and ophthalmic and nasal products, in addition to certain vaccines,” writes the FDA on its Thimerosal in Vaccinespage (http://www.fda.gov).

Don’t believe the lie: Thimerosal is eventually converted by the body into highly-toxic inorganic mercury

Another myth often spread by thimerosal advocates claims that the ethylmercury compounds that compose roughly 50 percent of the preservative are not actually harmful because they are different from the type found in a can of tuna. But a comprehensive review conducted by Dr. Paul G. King has proven otherwise, showing that ethylmercury is first metabolized by the body into toxic methylmercury, which is then metabolized into inorganic mercury.

Both methylmercury and inorganic mercury are listed by the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) as toxic substances responsible for causing neurological problems, brain disorders, nervous system illnesses, gastrointestinal problems, kidney failure, respiratory illness, and death.",conspiracy
226,"SCIENTISTS racing to find a coronavirus vaccine will infect volunteers with a strain of the deadly bug - for £3,500.

Up to 24 people at a time will be paid to be infected with a less harmful form of Covid-19 at a lab in east London, as part of a global experiment.

⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates

The participants will be regularly monitored by doctors in protective gear while in quarantine for 14 days.

Experts hope it will help them develop a vaccine that could be used next winter to protect the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.

Testing will begin once Hvivo, the company that runs the quarantine unit at the Queen Mary BioEnterprises Innovation Centre in Whitechapel, has secured permission from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).



Scientists will infect participants with two common strains of coronavirus - 0C43 and 229E - which cause mild respiratory illness.

Professor John Oxford, an expert in virology at the Queen Mary University of London, said volunteers would feel the symptoms of a cough or cold, which would model those of Covid-19.

He told The Times: “If it works on our little virus, it is very likely to work in the real world.""

Before they can take part, volunteers will be questioned about their medical history and given blood, urine, and cardiac tests.

They will also be screened to ensure they don't already have antibodies against coronavirus.

Andrew Catchpole, Hvivo’s chief scientist, told the paper: “We’ve actually all been exposed to many coronaviruses, which means we could have some kind of underlying immunity to it.""

Participants who are given clearance to take part will then attend the lab where they will be inoculated before going into isolation for 14 days.

During that time they will be unable to have physical contact with other people.

The only human contact they will have is with nurses and doctors in protective gear and ventilators who will enter the room for regular nasal swabs and blood tests.

Medics will also collect any dirty tissues so they can be weighed to measure their ""viral load"".

Researchers say it will allow them to test the efficacy of new viruses and antiviral medications in a safe environment.

The testing is part of a $2bn global effort to find a vaccine for Covid-19, which has now infected more than 110,00 people worldwide.

Dr Edward Wright, a senior lecturer in microbiology at the University of Sussex, told The Sun Online: ""There are several coronaviruses - seven types can infect humans.

""They include OC43 and 229E, which are being used in this study and are responsible for a large proportion of common colds.

""The other three are SARS, MERS and this new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2.

""It is not necessarily unusual for researchers to infect people with a milder cousin of the disease to stimulate an immune response.

""One of the very common approaches is to use a version of the virus that has been inactivated, meaning it’s unable to cause the disease and is chemically inactivated.

""This actually is very similar to how the whole process of vaccination was first identified.""

Dr Wright, who isn't involved in the new study, added that from his understanding those taking part in the trial will have to undergo regimented procedures and only people who are considered healthy would be infected.

He added: ""There are guidelines and regulations on who would be enrolled and it would rule out those people with underlying health conditions.

""If they’re healthy individuals, it is highly unlikely they will develop anything more serious than the symptoms of a common cold.

""For those who are thinking about taking part and are healthy, I would not be concerned.""



Last week, the UK Government pledged £46million for vaccine research and faster testing.

Boris Johnson’s funding boost is coming from the UK’s foreign aid budget and brings the Government’s commitment up to £91million.

Mr Johnson is confident that the funding will be able to deliver a vaccine in a year’s time.

It comes as a top medical expert warned Brits can now catch coronavirus“from anyone, anywhere, anytime” — and admitted we have lost track of who has it.

A surge in cases not linked to trips abroad, or contact with known carriers, means the bug is now spreading from person to person within the UK.

Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter, said: “The implication is we are now in the phase of ‘community transmission’.

“We no longer know where the virus is. You could catch it from anyone, anywhere, anytime — in your supermarket, coffee shop, petrol station or pub.”

Dr Pankhania added: “Preventative measures, such as handwashing and catching sneezes, are more important than ever.

“This is serious and not a joke. You have no idea how an individual may react if they catch it, so do not take risks.”

The Government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance added: “We can expect more cases. This is now outbreaks in the community.”

982,"A vaccine for the common and sometimes deadly RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) has been elusive, but scientists say a new discovery puts them much closer to success.

A new study from The Ohio State University provides a potential blueprint for finding the immunological sweet spot – a vaccine weak enough that it doesn’t make people sick but strong enough that it prompts an ample immune response, ensuring that the body will recognize RSV as an intruder in the future, and quickly mount a protective defense.

In a study published today (Oct. 9, 2019) in the journal Nature Communications, researchers report success in knocking out an epigenetic modification known as N6-methyladenosine in RSV RNA – a technique that proved to tamp down the virus and prompt a robust immune response in cotton rats.

“We now have a novel target to go after, and are working with industry toward a vaccine,” said the study’s senior author, Jianrong Li, an Ohio State professor of virology in the Department of Veterinary Biosciences.

Using a technique called reverse genetics, Ohio State researchers generated RSV that is defective in N6-methyladenosine methylation – one of the most common modifications that our cells make to RNA.

“What makes this especially exciting is that using this modified virus in a vaccine is likely to enhance a person’s innate immune response, a challenge that has stood in the way of vaccine development in the past,” said Miaoge Xue, the study’s lead author and a graduate student in Li’s laboratory.

“This approach may also work for similar viruses, such human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza virus 3,” said Xue, who recently presented these findings at the annual meeting of the American Society for Virology.

This discovery could also make vaccine production more economically feasible because it does not slow RSV growth in the lab – a critical step in vaccine production, said Li, who is also a member of Ohio State’s Infectious Disease Institute.",mainstream
414,"French drugmaker Sanofi SA said on Tuesday it expects to get approval for the potential COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc by the first half of next year, faster than previously anticipated.

Sanofi, which is hosting a virtual research and development event, and GSK had said in April the vaccine, if successful, would be available in the second half of 2021.

""We are being guided by our dialogue with regulatory authorities,"" Sanofi research chief John Reed told reporters, when asked about the accelerated time frame.

There are currently no vaccines to prevent the coronavirus that has infected more than 9 million people and killed over 469,000 globally, and only a couple of medicines that have demonstrated benefit in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in clinical trials.

Many drugmakers are racing to come up with a safe and effective vaccine that can be produced at large scale.

Moderna Inc, the University of Oxford in collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc, and an alliance of BioNTech and Pfizer Inc grabbed headlines by moving to human trials as early as March.

Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson said the firsts in the race now were not assured of securing victory.

""There are companies moving faster, but let us be brutally clear, speed has three downsides,"" he said of competition.

""They are using existing work, in many cases done for SARS; it is likely not to be as efficacious; and there is no guarantee on supply in large volumes,"" Hudson said.

The probability of success for Sanofi is ""higher than anybody else,"" the CEO said.

The comments echoed those of GSK, whose chief medical officer for vaccines told Reuters on Friday the company was aiming at quality before speed.

Sanofi, whose Pasteur vaccines division has a long established reputation, notably in flu, is currently working on two vaccine projects.

One uses an adjuvant made by GSK to potentially boost its efficacy. It has received financial support from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

The other, being developed with US company Translate Bio Inc, relies on a different technology known as mRNA, similar to the Moderna approach.

Clinical trials of the vaccine developed with GSK, described as a recombinant vaccine because of the use of GSK's boosting adjuvant, are to start in September. Trials of the mRNA vaccine candidate should begin around the end of the year, the company said.

Sanofi said it had capacity to produce up to 1 billion doses a year of its recombinant vaccine, and that it would be able to supply up to 360 million doses of its mRNA vaccine annually.

In April, Sanofi said it had manufacturing capacity for 600 million doses for its recombinant vaccine, with the ambition to double production by mid-2021.

The company also said it would expand its collaboration with Translate Bio on developing vaccines, in a deal which will give the US group $425 million in upfront payments.",mainstream
924,"Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vaccination ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control of global health policy.

Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems to be fueled by a conviction to save the world with technology.

Promising his share of $450 million of $1.2 billion to eradicate Polio, Gates took control of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) which mandated up to 50 doses (Table 1) of polio vaccines through overlapping immunization programs to children before the age of five. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490,000 children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and asked Gates and his vaccine policies to leave India. NPAFP rates dropped precipitously.

In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reluctantly admitted that the global explosion in polio is predominantly vaccine strain. The most frightening epidemics in Congo, Afghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines. In fact, by 2018, 70% of global polio cases were vaccine strain.

In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Merck, on 23,000 young girls in remote Indian provinces. Approximately 1,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders. Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates-funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The case is now in the country’s Supreme Court.

In 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a phase 3 trial of GSK’s experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,949 children.

During Gates’ 2002 MenAfriVac campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates’ operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis. Approximately 50 of the 500 children vaccinated developed paralysis. South African newspapers complained, “We are guinea pigs for the drug makers.” Nelson Mandela’s former Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates’ philanthropic practices as “ruthless and immoral.”

In 2010, Gates committed $10 billion to the WHO saying, “We must make this the decade of vaccines.” A month later, Gates said in a Ted Talk that new vaccines “could reduce population”. In 2014, Kenya’s Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO of chemically sterilizing millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a “tetanus” vaccine campaign. Independent labs found a sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally admitted it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade. Similar accusations came from Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines.

A 2017 study (Morgenson et. al. 2017) showed that WHO’s popular DTP vaccine is killing more African children than the diseases it prevents. DTP-vaccinated girls suffered 10x the death rate of children who had not yet received the vaccine. WHO has refused to recall the lethal vaccine which it forces upon tens of millions of African children annually.

Global public health advocates around the world accuse Gates of steering WHO’s agenda away from the projects that are proven to curb infectious diseases: clean water, hygiene, nutrition, and economic development. The Gates Foundation only spends about $650 million of its $5 billion dollar budget on these areas. They say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal philosophy that good health only comes in a syringe.

In addition to using his philanthropy to control WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, and PATH, Gates funds a private pharmaceutical company that manufactures vaccines, and additionally is donating $50 million to 12 pharmaceutical companies to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine. In his recent media appearances, Gates appears confident that the Covid-19 crisis will now give him the opportunity to force his dictatorial vaccine programs on American children.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said work is underway to ""stockpile"" jabs so they're available straight away if a vaccine is approved.

He told today's Downing Street briefing that drug company AstraZeneca has already started manufacturing a jab being produced by scientists at Oxford University.

Mr Hancock said: ""They're starting manufacture now, even ahead of approval, so we can build up a stockpile and be ready should it be clinically approved.""

A separate vaccine being produced at Imperial College in London is also at the first stage of clinical trials, he said.

People who will be first in the queue for jabs when one becomes available are:
• Social care workers, including those who work in care homes and who carry out home visits

On top of this, he said further research was being carried out to find out whether people from ethnic minority groups are at higher risk.

""We can protect the most at risk first should a vaccine become available,"" Mr Hancock said.

At the Downing Street press conference he said the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation had published interim advice.

""They recommend priority vaccination for two groups: frontline health and social care workers and those at increased risk of serious disease and death from coronavirus.""

That would include the over-50s and those with heart and kidney disease.

""As we learn more about the virus we will continue to take into account which groups may be particularly vulnerable, including, for example, those from ethnic minority backgrounds so that we can protect the most at risk first, should a vaccine become available, and get this country back on our feet as soon as we possibly can.""

Earlier today a World Health Organisation (WHO) boss warned a second wave of coronavirus could hit this autumn.

Nations have been urged today to adopt the track, test and isolate programme or suffer the consequences of the deadly new wave.

The warning comes just as the UK is abandoning its efforts to develop its own contact-tracing app.

Dr Hans Kluge, WHO's European regional director, said: ""It's well possible that when the autumn starts and we have also the seasonal influenza, there is the possibility of a seasonal effect on the virus - but we're not sure yet - that then we will see a second wave.

""So the lesson is that we have to implement what we know works - at the core of the strategy is to find as early as possible, isolate, test suspected people from Covid, and if needs be treat them without any stigma or discrimination.",mainstream
1318,"Mandatory Vaccination: Why We Still Got to Get Folks to Take Their Shots (2006 Third Year Paper)

Vaccination is widely considered one of the greatest medical achievements of modern civilization. Childhood diseases that were commonplace less than a generation ago are now increasingly rare because of vaccines. In order to be effective at eliminating communicable diseases, vaccines must be administered to sufficient levels of persons in the community. Because of this, public health officials have mandated vaccination for certain diseases as a condition to school attendance. The overwhelming effectiveness of vaccination programs may lead individuals to ignore the benefits of vaccination and focus more on the risk of side effects. Moreover, some have criticized the coercive nature of these programs. These objections may lead to an unacceptably high number of exemptions, which can compromise vaccination programs and leave the population susceptible to outbreaks. This paper explores vaccination programs with an eye toward greater public safety without ignoring the reality of a small but committed group of vaccine critics. The paper begins with a discussion of the historical development of mandatory vaccination policies and the issues posed by exemptions. It then addresses some of these issues in the context of vaccine safety. It also seeks solution by framing the discussion in economic terms. It concludes by recommending stricter enforcement of mandatory requirements for most vaccines and greater dissemination of information on the continued importance of vaccination.",mainstream

1031,"Public health advocates and doctors in Alberta are voicing concerns about the spread of misinformation after an anti-vaccination film was screened at public libraries and select movie theatres in the province.

Princess Theatre in Edmonton and Plaza Theatre in Calgary hosted multiple screenings of the controversial film Vaxxed II: The People's Truth, a sequel to a 2016 documentary that spread the unfounded claim that vaccines are linked to autism.

The anti-vaccine non-profit group Canadians for Vaccine Choice has also hosted screenings at the Grande Prairie and Medicine Hat public libraries this month.

""It's not scientific at all. It's total propaganda based on people's emotions,"" said Dr. Joan Robinson, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the University of Alberta.

""I think it's very disappointing that it would be shown in a public forum, especially by the public library.""

The original 2016 Vaxxed documentary was directed and co-written by Andrew Wakefield, who led a now-discredited 1998 study that fuelled the claim that measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is linked to autism.

The filmmakers say they connected with thousands of people eager to tell their stories in the wake of its release. Those stories form the backbone of the sequel, Vaxxed II.

""There is absolutely no question in my mind after making this film that these doctors don't know what they're talking about,"" said director Brian Burrowes.

The film leans to anecdotal evidence more than data, featuring parents emboldened by the original film sharing the belief that immunizations harmed their child.

""It's untrue. It's fearmongering,"" said Timothy Caulfield, Canada Research Chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta.

""This is not about an open debate and freedom of expression. This is really about the spreading of harmful information that can really erode public confidence in vaccines.""

The owner of Princess and Plaza theatres did not respond to a request for comment from CBC News.

Canadians for Vaccine Choice scheduled another screening of the film in Edmonton on Feb. 1, but will only disclose the location to ticket holders a day in advance.

""If we really believe in science in society, then I think we should not be trying to promote something that's completely not scientific to the general public,"" Robinson said.

The film was screened in a rented room at the Grande Prairie Public Library on Monday afternoon to about eight people, including three organizers of the event, according to library director Deb Cryderman.

Cryderman justified the decision to rent the room based on the library's commitment to free expression.

The rental policy simply states a library will not knowingly allow the space to be used for any illegal activity. Otherwise, anyone is welcome, Cryderman said.

""Even if information is controversial or doesn't correlate with our beliefs or we don't agree with it, we can still offer a room rental,"" she said.

Chief librarian Ken Feser of the Medicine Hat Public Library referenced a similar policy to justify the decision to rent out a room for the film on Jan. 21.

But Caulfield said he feared the public libraries were offering a veneer of legitimacy to the film's misinformation.

""We know that the spread of misinformation is connected to physical harm, people getting infectious diseases, and given that I think there's a justification for saying, no, we're not going to show this kind of material,"" he said.

About a dozen people mingled in the foyer of the Princess Theatre after a Sunday matinee screening of the documentary.

Luba Moe said that while she immunized her own children, she's glad her grandchildren are unvaccinated after watching the film.

""If I had to do it over again, there is no way I would vaccinate them. No way,"" she said.

Moe teared up as she recalled the parents in the film.

""These aren't tears of sadness, they're tears of passion,"" Moe said.

""They're holding us in fear, and we've got to wake up and do our own research and not follow like a bunch of lambs to the slaughter.""

The rise of the anti-vaccination movement has prompted the World Health Organization to name vaccine hesitancy a last year.

About half of Canadians have some level of vaccine hesitancy, according to by U.K.-based Wellcome Global Monitor that tracks global confidence in immunization.

that hesitancy is propelling some measles outbreaks in . But the filmmakers are pleased to know the movie is turning people away from immunization.

""Anytime someone decides not to vaccinate, I'm perfectly happy with it. I'm not worried these diseases are going to come back,"" said film director Burrowes.

The largest and most recent study looking for correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism covered roughly 650,000 children born in Denmark over 14 years and found no increased risk for autism among babies with the MMR vaccine.

Measles has been virtually eliminated in Canada since the vaccine was introduced in the 1960s. At the time, there were upwards of . Last year, there were 113 cases reported by .

Another chief claim of the film is that the HPV vaccine produced serious, life-altering symptoms. But a systematic review completed for the found no relationship between any serious adverse event and the vaccine.

On the contrary, scientists from Canada and Britain found the vaccine significantly reduced the likelihood of contracting the virus that causes a majority of cervical cancers.

• ABC: Senator Dick Pan seeks to do away with “bogus medical exemptions” in California (he’s already gotten rid of religious and personal belief)

And yet, when vaccine injuries occur – which is often enough that the federal government maintains a vaccine injury fund – they are brushed under the rug by the mainstream media as “rare” and “unusual,” if such incidents are covered at all.

But one man who was recently injured by vaccines has as compelling a case to make against mandatory vaccination as anyone: Ironically, he once worked for California Sen. Richard Pan – the pediatrician/lawmaker behind SB277, the state’s recently enacted mandatory vaccination law. He explains in a new video (which is no longer available) what he believes is motivating his former boss.

The man, John Berchielli, says he “was a perfectly healthy person” before he received “a vaccination recommended by my doctor.” (Although the original video is no longer available, you can check out the one below that we found.)

The “disease or syndrome” that he has since contracted has left him bedridden, wheelchair-bound and partially paralyzed, he said.

And now that he is stricken, he says slowly, “it’s hard not to think of the decisions of… Gov. [Jerry] Brown [of California] and [Democratic] Sen. Richard Pan on the mandatory bill they signed into law requiring children to be vaccinated in order to get a public education.”

“From looking on the Internet and from the Mayo Clinic’s website,” he continued, “20,000 people a year are afflicted by this… syndrome that I have. Our lawmakers recently passed a law that allows vaccines to be mandated, yet the manufacturers have complete immunity of the side effects and damages caused by their vaccines.”

• Is this the most savage witch hunt of the 21st Century?

Berchielli went on to question how Pan, a physician who runs the pediatric training program at the University of California, Davis, campus, could be such an advocate for a vaccine capable of causing the kind of harm that he and thousands of others are suffering from, something he called “incomprehensible.”

“Not only does he… lack any moral character of any kind, but because this law is a primary fiscal benefit to the University of California [which] does the research and development of these vaccines and then gets paid to test these vaccines, and then gets paid to administrate these vaccines, it’s a complete cash cow for the university,” he said.

“They bought themselves a senator named Dr. Richard Pan, who used to be a community pediatrician whose philosophy used to be at the time I worked for this man as a volunteer for over seven years, in the capacity of pediatric training,” Berchielli continued.

“To have him become a tool and a pawn of the university for the sake of generating billions and billions of dollars into the university, which is a direct benefit to the state of California… it’s all about the money, folks,” he said, adding that UC Davis was also one of Pan’s major campaign contributors.

What has happened in California – and likely to happen in other states or in all states – is that informed consent and personal choice have been stripped away from residents, Berchielli said.

934,"The responders carried 3,500 doses of Ebola vaccine and 2,000 cartridges for lab testing, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists covering his regular virtual update on the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This is an important reminder that even as WHO focuses on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to monitor and respond to many other health emergencies,” he said.

The Ebola outbreak in Mbandaka, located in Equateur province in northwest DRC – on the opposite side of the country to the worst epidemic in the country’s history that is petering out - was confirmed earlier this week.

So far, eight cases have been detected, four of whom have died.

“The latest person confirmed with Ebola attended the burial of one of the first cases, but was detected in the town of Bikoro, 150 kilometres away from Mbandaka. This means that two health zones are now affected,” said Tedros.

Mbandaka had suffered a previous Ebola outbreak in May 2018, which was halted in three months.

Meanwhile, the DRC is still fighting an Ebola outbreak in the east that emerged in August 2018, and now appears to be in its final stages.

As of Wednesday, the global COVID-19 caseload had reached nearly 6.3 million, with nearly 380,000 deaths.

Tedros said more than 100,000 cases of the disease have been reported to WHO for each of the past five days.

The Americas continue to account for most cases worldwide.

For several weeks now, the region has had more cases than all other countries combined.

“We are especially worried about Central and South America, where many countries are witnessing accelerating epidemics”, said the WHO chief.

“We also see increasing numbers of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Africa, although the numbers are much smaller.”

Meanwhile, COVID-19 continues to be on the decline in Europe. Tuesday saw the fewest cases reported in the region in more than two months.

Investigations will continue into the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19, Tedros further reported.

The drug, which is used to treat rheumatology conditions, was among four medicines being tested in a Solidarity Clinical Trial conducted by WHO and partners.

The Executive Group for the trial, representing 10 participating countries, put hydroxychloroquine on pause due to safety concerns. A monitoring committee has been reviewing related data.

“On the basis of the available mortality data, the members of the committee recommended that there are no reasons to modify the trial protocol”, said Tedros.

“The Executive Group received this recommendation and endorsed the continuation of all arms of the Solidarity Trial, including hydroxychloroquine.”

The Solidarity Clinical Trial was announced on 18 March: one week after the pandemic was declared, and 60 days after China shared the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus.

So far, more than 3,500 patients in 35 countries have been recruited.

The other treatments under study are remdesivir, previously tested as an Ebola treatment; lopinavir/ritonavir, which is a licensed treatment for HIV; and interferon beta-1a, a medicine for multiple sclerosis.

Relatedly, the UN and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement on Wednesday called for governments and the private sector to unite towards developing “a people’s vaccine” against COVID-19.

They stressed that “no one should be left behind” in the race to identify the most effective means to defeat the virus.

“A people’s vaccine should protect the affluent in cities and the poor in rural communities, the old in care homes and the young in refugee camps”, they said.

“A global social contract for a people’s vaccine against COVID-19 is a moral imperative that brings us all together in our shared humanity.”

The partners said unity and commitment towards this common goal should also spark global resolve to sustain immunization against preventable diseases.

178,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A special U.S. court ruled against three families on Thursday who claimed vaccines caused their children’s autism.

The Vaccine Court Omnibus Autism Proceeding ruled against the parents of Michelle Cedillo, Colten Snyder and William Yates Hazlehurst, who had claimed that a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had combined with other vaccine ingredients to damage the three children.

“Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment,” Special Master George Hastings, a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice, wrote in the 183-page Cedillo ruling.

The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault system that has a $2.5 billion fund built up from a 75-cent-per-dose tax on vaccines.

Instead of judges, three “special masters” heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners.

They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, plus a mercury-containing preservative called thimerosal, caused the children’s symptoms.

“The evidence does not support the general proposition that thimerosal-containing vaccines can damage infants’ immune systems,” Hastings wrote, after reviewing tens of thousands of documents and hours of oral arguments.

“I further conclude that while Michelle Cedillo has tragically suffered from autism and other severe conditions, the petitioners have also failed to demonstrate that her vaccinations played any role at all in causing those problems.”

Michelle’s parents argued that she was a normal baby until she received the vaccine.

Experts say parents often link vaccines with their children’s symptoms because they are vaccinated at an age when autism and related disorders are often first diagnosed.

“We need ongoing research into the causes of autism, but cannot let unfounded myths keep us from giving our children the proven protection they need against infectious diseases,” the American Medical Association said in response to the ruling.

The Institute of Medicine reviewed the evidence in 2001 and 2004, and determined there was no link between vaccines and autism. Many other studies have shown no link, but a small and vocal group of parents continues to press the case.

The advocacy group Autism Speaks said the ruling did not necessarily clear vaccines, or any other potential cause.

“We will continue to support authoritative research that addresses unanswered questions about whether certain subgroups of individuals with particular underlying medical or genetic conditions may be more vulnerable to adverse effects of vaccines,” the group said in a statement.

Hastings rejected this argument in his ruling.

More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children and were seeking payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The no-fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine-making business.

619,"Humans may be to blame for rising mercury levels in a species of fish that's very popular as food, according to a news study published this week. Levels of a potentially poisonous form of the element have been creeping up in Pacific yellowfin tuna 3.8 percent every year since 1998, according to a report discussed an article by the Los Angeles Times.

Methyl Mercury levels in tuna and other large fish have been a public health concern for some time. Health authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration recommend that young children, as well as women who are either pregnant or nursing limit their intake of tuna, and avoid other large species entirely, including swordfish and tilefish.

The study adds to evidence suggesting that human activity—particularly the burning of coal—is causing a buildup of the element in the air and water that is subsequently making its way into the food chain, according to an article in the Los Angeles Times discussing the research. Some fishing industry groups have long maintained that mercury levels in tuna and large fish are stable and come from natural sources, such as deep ocean vents.

Yellowfin—sometimes called ahi tuna—is sold in steaks and eaten in sushi, and can be sometimes found in small amounts in canned light tuna. The fact that the fish are not top-level predators could indicate that a broader swath of ocean life may be accumulating mercury levels that would make them hazardous to human health, if eaten.

""What this number is saying is that the amount of mercury in fish is getting higher and higher all the time, and if it keeps going like that, at some point, most every kind of fish is going to be potentially hazardous,"" study coauthor Carl Lamborg told the Los Angeles Times. ""Where that point is, I don't know.""

Vaccines save lives and protect our children from debilitating and deadly disease, and they promote the overall health of our communities.

Natalia Cales is executive officer of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Region IV.

Measles is not a harmless childhood illness. It is actually a highly contagious, dangerous disease that can even be deadly. But measles is also easily preventable with a vaccine.

As the executive officer for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Region 4, which includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, it’s my job to raise awareness of facts that can help protect the health of all Americans.

Make sure to talk to your doctor about vaccinations for your children

Vaccines do not cause autism and do not contain toxic chemicals. Any serious side effects from vaccines are exceedingly rare, and the protection from disease that vaccines provide far outweighs any potential risks.

If you’re a parent, talk to your child’s doctor to make sure your child is up to date on all of his or her scheduled vaccinations. This is especially important if you have an infant, because vaccinating your baby on the recommended immunization schedule provides protection against 14 serious childhood illnesses.

For measles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get two doses of the MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.

We all want our children to grow up in a world that is free from preventable diseases. The single most important thing each of us can do to achieve that goal is to get fully vaccinated – for ourselves, our families, and our communities.

207,"Whether you call it a fitness trend or a mindfulness practice (or a bit of both), what exactly is forest bathing? The term emerged in Japan in the 1980s as a physiological and psychological exercise called shinrin-yoku (“forest bathing” or “taking in the forest atmosphere”). The purpose was twofold: to offer an eco-antidote to tech-boom burnout and to inspire residents to reconnect with and protect the country’s forests.

The Japanese quickly embraced this form of ecotherapy. In the 1990s, researchers began studying the physiological benefits of forest bathing, providing the science to support what we innately know: time spent immersed in nature is good for us. While Japan is credited with the term shinrin-yoku, the concept at the heart of the practice is not new. Many cultures have long recognised the importance of the natural world to human health.

Forest bathing is not just for the wilderness-lover; the practice can be as simple as walking in any natural environment and consciously connecting with what’s around you. For a more structured experience, you can join trained guides for a meditative two- to three-hour ecotherapy excursion. Here are five places to try forest bathing.",mainstream
71,"Horseshoe crabs may be the answer to a safe coronavirus vaccine next year. Here's why.

EAST FALMOUTH — For 450 million years, horseshoe crabs have scuttled along the ocean floor, coming ashore to lay eggs.

You need pretty strong defenses to survive mass extinctions and the oversized predators that evolved before man came on the scene. While its helmeted body certainly protected it, the horseshoe crab, living in a bacterial soup, had another defense — blood that quickly clotted to stop infection from cuts and loss of limbs.

Just as it is for this primordial animal, bacteria is all around us.

“It’s not dangerous until it crosses the blood wall,” said Brett Hoffmeister, limulous amebocyte lysate (LAL) production manager for Associates of Cape Cod in East Falmouth. “If it gets into the blood or spinal fluid, you have a problem.”

Because of its quick and detectable response to bacteria, horseshoe crab blood is used in testing anything that can be surgically implanted, injected or swallowed as medication. That includes hip replacements, heart stents, pharmaceuticals, intravenous solutions and vaccines such as the annual flu vaccine, and the coronavirus vaccines now in development with potentially worldwide distribution.

While other tests exist like synthetic LAL and a human blood test, LAL bacterial endotoxin testing is the gold standard, Hoffmeister said.

The LAL test was first developed in Falmouth by Jack Levin and Frederik Bang of Massachusetts Biological Laboratory. Associates of Cape Cod, the first company licensed to manufacture it, was founded in 1974 by Stanley Watson, a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution senior scientist who investigated the horseshoe crab extract as a way to measure bacterial biomass in seawater.

The company now has over 200 employees and offices worldwide, Hoffmeister said. There are only four manufacturers in the U.S.

Hoffmeister said his company doesn’t anticipate a very big increase in demand for LAL to test and manufacture new vaccines. Very little is needed to test a sample of the vaccine, and it would take only a day of production to manufacture enough to assure the purity of even an estimated five billion doses, he said.

Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was concern over the fate of the horseshoe crab. The crab’s numbers appeared to drop to the point where birders and national bird conservation organizations like the National Audubon Society expressed alarm over a lack of horseshoe crab eggs, a primary food for endangered shorebird species like red knot along their migratory route.

Many were concerned about a big increase in harvests by a bait fishery in which the crabs were used to attract conch, eels and other species to traps. Others worried about the number of crabs dying from handling and bleeding in the biomedical industry.

Daily limits and bans on bait fishing in critical horseshoe crab areas like Delaware Bay and in Massachusetts and other spots along the eastern shore helped bring that fishery under control. The bait harvest peaked in 1999 at 2.6 million crabs and has remained under 1 million crabs since 2003, according to a 2019 stock assessment by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.

In that 2019 assessment, the commission estimated a 15% mortality for the biomedical field. Most of the horseshoe crab blood is in the gills, and LAL technicians only use a small portion contained in sinus sack. The animal is returned to the water within 24 hours, Hoffmeister said. Total estimated mortality for the nearly 500,000 crabs used exclusively for the biomedical industry in 2017 was 72,674 animals. Over 990,000 were caught and killed in the bait fishery that year, according to commission data.

Derek Perry, an invertebrate fisheries biologist at the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, said that other fisheries dwarf the impact of the biomedical industry.

“In the (ASMFC) stock assessment, they say that discard mortality from the mobile gear fleet (fish trawlers and shellfish draggers) could be higher than the biomedical and bait fish combined,” he said.

Although they haven’t been able to determine what constitutes a healthy horseshoe crab population, or a sustainable amount to harvest, commission officials said that the majority of indices indicate these prehistoric survivors appear headed in the right direction.

Perry pointed out that trawl surveys along the East Coast, with the exception of the New York area, were all showing increased horseshoe crab abundance.

“Our trawl survey, with a 40 year history, had the highest data point in years this year, so our population seems to be increasing,” Perry said.

His agency sends guidelines to Associates of Cape Cod on how to safely handle crabs to reduce mortality, and they are in the East Falmouth facility once a month during the season to assess the health and handling of the crabs.",mainstream
1115,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Tokyo Olympics next July will be a “uniquely risky” event, demanding flexibility from organisers amid the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly if a vaccine has not been rolled out by then, medical experts say.

Japan and the International Olympic Committee made the unprecedented decision last month to delay the Games for a year, as the world battles the virus that has infected 2.3 million people and killed more than 150,000 globally.

But questions persist whether the Games can go ahead 15 months from now, as a vaccine could still be at least a year away, according to the most optimistic estimates.

“When we talk about bringing sports back with packed stadiums, I really think that is something we are going to have to wait for a vaccine to be able to do,” said Zach Binney, an epidemiologist at Emory University in the United States.

Tokyo 2020 is set to run from July 23 to Aug. 8 next year, but organisers expect few changes to the original plan, including attendance by enthusiastic supporters.

But that might be over optimistic, Binney, a specialist in aspects of athlete health, told Reuters.

“Every person that you add to a gathering adds risk,” said Binney, who expects vaccine development would take 1-1/2 years from the start of the outbreak, or until late 2021, at the earliest.

“So once you get up to 50,000, 70,000, 100,000 (fans)... that is an enormous amount of risk to be taking on without a vaccine.”

The Olympics was “a uniquely risky event”, he added, because of the threats represented by visitors streaming in from areas with a lot of infections, and the reverse flow when they return afterwards, perhaps carrying home infections.

Although more hopeful for a vaccine to be found within a year, Jason Kindrachuk, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Manitoba in Canada, flagged a risk of further delay to the Games, as vaccinating people would take time.

“It is going to push the limits right up to the border of when the Olympics should be starting,” said Kindrachuk, who has worked on outbreaks of Ebola and SARS.

“You want to get people vaccinated not right at the point of the Olympics, but a little bit beforehand, so they build up that protective immunity.”

Dr Kentaro Iwata, who drew international attention for his criticism of the Japanese government after a visit in February to the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined with thousands of passengers, expressed pessimism over the new date.

“I don’t think the Olympics is likely to be held next year, if held at any time,” the virologist told the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan in a teleconference.

“Japan might be able to control this disease by next summer, and I wish we could, but I don’t think that would happen everywhere on earth,” the Kobe University professor added.

In response, the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee said it was focusing purely on delivering the Games next year.

“The mission is to prepare the stage for next summer; we do not feel it is appropriate to respond to speculative questions,” spokesman Masa Takaya said in an email to Reuters on Monday.

Even if a vaccine were not ready, the organisers might still be able to hold the Games, as long as they were flexible and well prepared, Kindrachuk added.

“It is going to take some creative thinking, and hopefully some willingness from the public, to at least still partake in watching... understanding that it is just simply not going to look like what we have seen before.”

Binney said the safest option would be for athletes to arrive in Tokyo four to six weeks in advance and follow rigorous isolation measures for two weeks before moving into the Olympic village to train for the remaining period.

“My goal would be to have the Olympic Village as a virus-free quarantine zone,” he added.",mainstream
22,"Although public health researchers have worked to counter misinformation about vaccines and raise vaccination rates, a number of the methods they are using may be ineffective, according to a new study.

In the study, researchers focused on the now-debunked idea that the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (or MMR) caused autism. Surveying 1,759 parents, researchers found that while they were able to teach parents that the vaccine and autism were not linked, parents who were surveyed who had initial reservations about vaccines said they were actually less likely to vaccinate their children after hearing the researchers messages.

""The first message of our study is that the messaging we use to promote childhood vaccines may not be effective, and in some cases may be counterproductive,"" said Brendan Nyhan, an assistant professor in the department of government at Dartmouth College, who researches misconceptions about health care. ""We need more evidence-based messaging about vaccines. We don't know what works, and we need to learn more, rather than relying on hunches or intuition.""

The myth that the MMR vaccine can cause autism grew out of a small, 1998 British study that has since been retracted. The paper's author was later found guilty of misconduct and can no longer practice medicine in the UK. A number of large-scale studies conducted since then have showed no connection. [7 Medical Myths Even Doctors Believe]

In the new study, researchers looked at four methods designed to counter the myth that the MMR vaccine can cause autism. They gave people either information from health authorities about the lack of evidence for a connection, information about the danger of the three diseases the MMR vaccine protects against, pictures of children who had one of those three diseases, or a story about an infant who almost died from measles.

At the study's start, the group of parents who were most opposed to vaccination said that on average, the chance they would vaccinate a future child against MMR was 70 percent.

After these parents had been given information that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism, they said, on average, the chance they would vaccinate a future child was only 45 percent — even though they also said they were now less likely to believe the vaccine could cause autism.

In other words, giving the parents new information made them more opposed to vaccinating a future child.

Nyhan said the exact reason for this phenomenon is unclear, but past research gives some hints.

""We suggest that people are motivated to defend their more skeptical or less favorable attitudes towards vaccines,"" Nyhan told Live Science.

In the face of evidence that one of their notions about vaccines is incorrect, he explained, people may recall other objections or concerns they have, and as a result they become less likely to say they would vaccinate, rather than more.

To counter this, he said, public health strategies will need to target opposition to vaccines by keeping in mind that there are a number of reasons parents may be opting not to vaccinate.

One limit, Nyhan said, is that the study merely looked at parents' intentions. As the actual concern is vaccination, it's important for researchers to consider vaccination rates, he said.

Also, as vaccination rates are currently high, it's important to keep in mind that any strategies should focus on retaining these numbers and not raise more concerns, tipping parents who are willing to vaccinate away from doing so.

The positive takeaway, Nyhan said, is that researchers have the tools to learn more about what messages do work, and can hopefully develop strategies that will lift vaccination rates higher.

But given the range of groups with some impulse against vaccination, it likely won't be simple to find a message that works for everyone.

""We shouldn't put too much weight on the idea that there's some magic message out there that will change people minds,"" he said.

The study is published today (March 3) in the journal Pediatrics.

786,"Two years ago, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a renewed focus on communities and its Groups feature, boasting that it would help create a more ""meaningful"" social infrastructure.

It worked. Last month, Zuckerberg told investors that ""hundreds of millions"" of users reported belonging in ""meaningful groups,"" up from one million in 2017, when the company began focusing on Groups.

""Connecting with communities of people that you're interested in is going to be as central to the experience as connecting with friends and family,"" he told investors last month.

But that shift has also moved Facebook activity out of public view, leaving researchers to warn that they now know less about what is happening on the social network and how the company's algorithm-driven recommendations are funneling people to fringe communities and misinformation.

""As a researcher, we can get content but content isn't what you need to research Facebook and see how these groups work,"" said Jonathan Albright, director of research at Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism. ""We need to know more about the networks and members of groups that spread false information and target individuals.""

""It would take a lot of work and more of a partnership than Facebook is willing to establish, especially for this kind of work,"" Albright said.

Groups gained public attention this week when The Guardian uncovered a vast network of groups spreading false information about vaccines. ""STOP Mandatory Vaccination,"" one of the largest anti-vaccine private groups at more than 126,000 members, is led by Larry Cook, a self-described ""social media activist"" with no children or medical training. Cook and his members promote the disproven theory that vaccines cause autism and spread conspiracies that outbreaks of preventable diseases are ""hoaxes"" perpetrated by the government.

In response to the negative press, Facebook told Bloomberg News it was considering ""reducing or removing this type of content"" from the recommendations it offers users.

Those recommendations have also come under increased scrutiny. Part of Facebook's plan for growth has relied on it's recommendation engine—the algorithm the company relies on to get users to join more groups.

The algorithm that powers the right rail of ""suggested groups"" isn't public, and a Facebook spokesperson declined to give details other than saying they are tailored to individual users. But researchers like Renée DiResta, who studies online disinformation as director of research at cybersecurity company New Knowledge, have found Facebook users down a rabbit hole of increasingly misinformed, conspiratorial and radical communities.

Zuckerberg has acknowledged the significance of the recommendation engine, writing in 2017, ""Most don't seek out groups on their own—friends send invites or Facebook suggests them.""

Facebook is not the only tech company to face criticism for developing automated recommendations that push users toward misinformation. YouTube, a subsidiary of Alphabet's Google, recently announced it would be changing its own recommendation engine to stop suggesting conspiracy videos, after years of similar outcry from researchers and former employees critical of what they claimed was the company's bargain in which it suggested extreme content to keep people watching.

Facebook doesn't appear to have any plans to follow suit. A Facebook spokesperson pointed NBC News to the option it provides users to hide or remove the groups that Facebook suggests.

Meanwhile, uneven enforcement across the platform means a person or page may be disciplined or banned while a related group continues to operate. Facebook does not appear to be enforcing its 2018 ban on the conspiracy news site Infowars in its Groups feature, highlighting how communities can skirt Facebook's broader efforts to clean up its platform.

Facebook updated its enforcement policy last week, closing a loophole that had allowed Alex Jones, owner of Infowars, to operate pages on the platform despite the ban. In doing so, it shut down 22 separate InfoWars pages. But in a private Facebook group of more than 117,000 members, administered by Jones and several of his employees, Infowars lives on.

The group describes itself as ""an alternative media source for those who are awake!"" and members share and comment on far-right, anti-Muslim and conspiracy content—much of it from InfoWars' website—while Jones and the other moderators and administrators keep members informed of alternate pages and groups set up to evade the company's original ban and promote supplements and prepper gear sold in the Infowars' store.

When asked about the Infowars group, a Facebook spokesperson noted that the updated policy applies across Facebook features and products including Pages, Groups, Events and Instagram, and said the company had only begun to enforce it. At its rollout of the updated policy, Facebook said it would be looking at two criteria to decide which groups to purge: whether the groups have the same admins or similar group names to those that had been removed — benchmarks the InfoWars group appears to meet.

""The recent removals are a first step, and we will continue to expand in the months ahead,"" the Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.

Meanwhile, inside its private community, the InfoWars description reads: ""This group is doing great.",mainstream

254,"Children with autism and their younger siblings are less likely to be fully vaccinated than neurotypical children and their siblings, new research from the US has found.

Of children aged seven years and older, 94% of neurotypical children had received all the recommended vaccinations for children aged 4-6 years. For those with autism, the rate was 82%.

It has been two decades since Andrew Wakefield’s now retracted and widely discredited study in The Lancet falsely linked the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism.

This new study, published today in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, suggests many parents still have concerns around vaccines and autism.

The study included 3,729 children with autism and 592,907 neurotypical children who were born between 1995 and 2010, and their younger siblings born between 1997 and 2014.

Children with autism were observed after diagnosis; matched with neurotypical children based on age, sex and location. Researchers reviewed what proportion of each group had received the vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at 4-6 years and 11-12 years.

“We found that after children received an autism diagnosis, the rates of vaccination were significantly lower when compared with children of the same age who did not have an autism diagnosis,” said lead author Ousseny Zerbo, a researcher at Kaiser Permanente.

The vaccine adherence of the younger siblings was studied at 1-11 months, 1-2 years, 4-6 years, and 11-12 years.

The highest rates of under-vaccination in this study were among siblings of children with autism in the 1-11 months and 1-2 years age groups.

In the youngest age group, 73% of younger siblings of children with autism were fully vaccinated, compared with 85% of younger siblings of neurotypical children. In 1-2-year-olds, this was 60% compared with 71%.

At 4-6 years, 83% of younger siblings of children with autism were fully vaccinated, compared with 95% of younger siblings of neurotypical children.

This suggests some parents consider the potential risks of autism associated with vaccination to be highest at these younger ages at which more vaccines are recommended. However, as their children grow older, these parents may be more willing to vaccinate.

Despite the fluctuation between age groups, the disparities in vaccination rates between children with autism and neurotypical children, and their younger siblings, are reasonably consistent (with the exception of the 11-12-year-old age group).

While this research was quantitative in nature and therefore not able to give insight into why these disparities exist, the authors said parental vaccine refusal would likely play a role.

Sydney University’s Dr Nicholas Wood, who was not involved in the study, said this could be the case on two fronts. For children with autism, parents might resist administering further vaccinations for fear of worsening the condition; a notion which is not grounded in evidence.

For the younger siblings, parents might feel the early childhood vaccinations caused autism in their older child, and are therefore unwilling to have their subsequent children vaccinated.

“Traditionally there has been a thinking that ASD (autism spectrum disorder) is linked with the MMR vaccine,” Wood said.

Looking specifically at the MMR vaccine, 96% of neurotypical children were vaccinated at 4-6 years, compared with 84% of those with autism.

Of the younger siblings of neurotypical children, 94% received their MMR vaccination for 1-2 years, while for siblings of children with autism in the same age group, the rate was 77%. These figures suggest Wakefield’s 1998 study continues to generate fear.

“Parents of ASD kids may be worried; they may still feel that the MMR vaccine led to autism. And that a second dose may cause a regression,” Wood said.

While the MMR vaccine had the lowest uptake of all the vaccines studied among children with an ASD and their younger siblings, Wood noted parents’ concerns surrounding MMR appeared to have translated across to other vaccines, too.

The Murdoch Children’s Research Institute’s Dr Margie Danchin, who wasn’t involved with the study, said this research provides important information on parents’ behaviour. Clinically, she sees concerns expressed by parents about vaccines and autism every week - and this study is evidence these concerns translate into behaviour on a population level, albeit in the US.

“What it really highlights is that we as health care providers have a lot of work to do to reassure parents that there is no association. The evidence is clear that there is no causal link,” Danchin said.

In 2017, Danchin and her colleagues published research in an Australian setting which found 16% of mothers who were pregnant for the first time were concerned vaccines can cause autism.

“This study needs to be followed up with qualitative research. By speaking to these parents, we can drill down on what their specific concerns are so that we can develop better strategies to reassure them and increase vaccine uptake,” she said.",mainstream
712,"The massive controversy over Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s appalling 2007 executive order mandating that all young girls in his state receive Merck & Co.’s Gardasil vaccine before entering school has brought the issue of the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness, or lack thereof, back to the forefront of the national conversation. And a European physician has now openly spoken out against Gardasil, claiming that it is both dangerous and completely ineffective at preventing cervical cancer.

Dr. Christian Fiala, a general practitioner from Vienna, Austria, told WorldNetDaily(WND) in a recent report that Merck’s Gardasil does not actually work to prevent cervical cancer, and that it is not safe. According to Dr. Fiala, “there is no proof of a causal relationship of HPV (human papillomavirus) and cervical cancer, and there is no evidence that HPV vaccine reduces the overall number of cervical cancer (cases).”

Assuming for a moment that the Gardasil vaccine actually does help prevent HPV, Dr. Fiala asserts that HPV is not even itself responsible for causing cervical cancer, which makes the vaccine completely useless at accomplishing the very thing for which it is marketed. And as we previously reported, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also known since at least 2003 that HPV is not associated with causing cervical cancer as well (http://www.naturalnews.com/022404_vaccines_vaccinations.html).

But none of this has stopped Merck and its lackeys in the government and media from continuing to endorse the “money-making machine without any benefits for patients,” as Dr. Fiala calls it. And this was made abundantly clear when the mainstream media went on its rampage against Rep. Michele Bachmann following her recent comments about Gardasil’s dangers at the GOP presidential debates.

Dr. Fiala has been fighting against Gardasil in Austria for years, especially after several otherwise healthy and vibrant young girls in his country died just days after receiving their Gardasil vaccines. And while Gardasil is still legal in Austria, Dr. Fiala says it is “used infrequently,” thanks to widespread awareness of its potential to seriously injure and kill those who receive it.

“To say Gardasil has a suspect safety record is a big understatement,” said Tom Fitton, president of Washington watchdog group Judicial Watch, to WND. His group uncovered documents back in 2008 revealing that the FDA has known for a while that Gardasil is responsible for causing anaphylactic shock, foaming at the mouth, grand mal convulsions, coma, and paralyzation, among other things.

“These reports are troubling and show that the FDA and other public health authorities may be asleep at the switch.”

274,"The British doctor who controversially drew a link between autism and the triple vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) should be banned from practising medicine.

That’s the ruling issued today (pdf) by a panel of the General Medical Council, which regulates the medical profession in the UK.

Andrew Wakefield, who worked at the Royal Free Hospital, London, in 1998 when his controversial paper on MMR and autism was published, has said that he will appeal against the verdict.

Wakefield has told the BBC in a radio interview that he “categorically denies the charges” and will appeal against the verdict. If he doesn’t, he will automatically be struck off the UK medical register in 28 days.

The GMC panel also ruled that John Walker-Smith (pdf), a former colleague of Wakefield’s at the Royal Free Hospital, should be struck off. It cleared a third colleague, Simon Murch (pdf), of any wrongdoing.

The panel found Wakefield guilty of a litany of transgressions in the late 1990s, when he and his colleagues conducted their research on 12 children, leading to publication of the controversial findings in The Lancet in 1998.

The findings, retracted by The Lancet in February this year (pdf), linked the vaccine shots with the development of autism and bowel disorders. Panicked parents failed to have their children vaccinated, and the uptake rate for MMR, which had peaked at 92 per cent, fell to a low of 81 per cent in 2004.

The transgressions listed by the panel include dishonesty about the paper itself, undeclared conflicts of interest and ethical irregularities in how the children were recruited and managed during course of the research.

The panel points out that Wakefield’s patent on an alternative to MMR called Transfer Factor meant he stood to gain financially by discrediting the triple vaccine. He was also appearing as an expert witness in a court action against the vaccine.

He failed to mention any of this either to the hospital’s research and ethics committee or to The Lancet, the panel says.

The panel also concluded that Wakefield subjected the children to painful and invasive procedures that were not clinically necessary. Three children had spinal fluid taken through lumbar punctures, for example, and others underwent colonoscopies.

Not all the children had a history of being treated for gastrointestinal problems, contrary to what was stated in the paper in The Lancet, and nine underwent procedures for which Wakefield had not sought ethical approval.

The panel also condemned Wakefield’s failure to state in The Lancet the true purpose of the research, which was to investigate a proposed new syndrome following vaccination.

On another occasion, in 1999, he took blood from children at a party then paid them £5 for agreeing to it.

“Accordingly, the panel has determined that Dr Wakefield’s name should be erased from the medical register,” it said in its ruling, citing the need to protect patients and to maintain public trust and confidence in the medical profession.

The panel also recommended striking off John Walker-Smith for subjecting children to painful but unnecessary procedures, including colonoscopies, barium meals and lumbar punctures. The panel determined that, like Wakefield, Walker-Smith, an author on The Lancet paper, ought to have known of the widespread implications of the paper, and failed in his duty to ensure that the information in it was accurate.

Simon Murch was cleared of any wrongdoing and is free to continue practising as a doctor. The panel accepted that in carrying out colonoscopies for Walker-Smith, Murch was quite reasonably deferring to the clinical judgements and authority of his senior colleague.

The investigation is the longest in the GMC’s history, having lasted more than three years. Earlier this year, the GMC issued its preliminary findings on whether the three should face censure.

Shortly after this, Wakefield left the Thoughtful House Center for Children, which he founded in 2005 in Austin, Texas, to treat autism and related disorders.

Wakefield has no licence to practise in the US, and the GMC says it will circulate its verdict on him to similar bodies throughout the world.",mainstream

263,"Doctors in Kenya have accused UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation of secretly trying to sterilize millions of women in Africa via a tetanus vaccine program.

According to LifeSiteNews, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association say that doctors have uncovered evidence of a mass sterilisation program sponsored by the Kenyan government and funded by Bill Gates.

The Kenyan government denies there is anything wrong with the vaccine, and says it is perfectly safe.

The Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, however, saw evidence to the contrary, and had six different samples of the tetanus vaccine from various locations around Kenya sent to an independent laboratory in South Africa for testing.

The results confirmed their worst fears: all six samples tested positive for the HCG antigen. The HCG antigen is used in anti-fertility vaccines, but was found present in tetanus vaccines targeted to young girls and women of childbearing age. Dr. Ngare, spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, stated in a bulletin released November 4:

“This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored.” (Source)

Dr. Ngare brought up several points about the mass tetanus vaccination program in Kenya that caused the Catholic doctors to become suspicious:

Dr. Ngare told LifeSiteNews that several things alerted doctors in the Church’s far-flung medical system of 54 hospitals, 83 health centers, and 17 medical and nursing schools to the possibility the anti-tetanus campaign was secretly an anti-fertility campaign.

Why, they ask does it involve an unprecedented five shots (or “jabs” as they are known, in Kenya) over more than two years and why is it applied only to women of childbearing years, and why is it being conducted without the usual fanfare of government publicity?

“Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years, we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound, men, women or children.” said Dr. Ngare.

But it is the five vaccination regime that is most alarming. “The only time tetanus vaccine has been given in five doses is when it is used as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) developed by WHO in 1992.”

UNICEF: A History of Taking Advantage of Disasters to Mass Vaccinate

It should be noted that UNICEF and WHO distribute these vaccines for free, and that there are financial incentives for the Kenyan government to participate in these programs. When funds from the UN are not enough to purchase yearly allotments of vaccines, an organization started and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI, provides extra funding for many of these vaccination programs in poor countries.

Also, there was no outbreak of tetanus in Kenya, only the perceived “threat” of tetanus due to local flood conditions.

These local disasters are a common reason UNICEF goes into poorer countries with free vaccines to begin mass vaccination programs.

Health Impact News reported last year that UNICEF began a similar mass vaccination program with 500,000 doses of live oral polio vaccine in the Philippines after a Super Typhoon devastated Tacolban and surrounding areas. This was in spite of the fact there were no reported cases of polio in the Philippines since 1993, and people who have had the live polio vaccine can “shed” the virus into sewage systems, thereby causing the actual disease it is supposed to be preventing.

A very similar mass vaccination with the live oral polio vaccine occurred among Syrian refugees in 2013, when 1.7 million doses of polio vaccine were purchased by UNICEF, in spite of the fact that no cases of polio had been seen since 1999. After the mass vaccination program started, cases of polio began to reappear in Syria.

It seems quite apparent that UNICEF and WHO use these local disasters to mass vaccinate people, mainly children and young women. Massive education and propaganda efforts are also necessary to convince the local populations that they need these vaccines. Here is a video UNICEF produced for the tetanus vaccine in Kenya. Notice how they use school teachers and local doctors to do the educating, even though the vaccines are produced by western countries.",conspiracy

An experimental coronavirus vaccine from Oxford University appears to be effective at preventing COVID-19, according to findings from a small study in six monkeys.

Oxford scientists posted the preliminary findings on the vaccine on the preprint server bioRxiv early Thursday.

Preprints are studies that have not undergone a rigorous peer-review process required for publication in medical or scientific journals. But many scientists have been releasing results to the public in the form of preprints because of the high level of interest surrounding potential treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

The new report from Oxford University is based on the vaccination of six rhesus macaques. These monkeys are considered to be good proxies for how drugs could work in people because they share a majority of their genes with humans.

The animals were given half of the dose currently being tested in human. Those trials began on April 24 and include about 1,110 people.

Researchers reported at least some of the monkeys developed antibodies to the virus within 14 days of being vaccinated, and all of the vaccinated animals had evidence of antibodies within 28 days.

What's more, researchers said the vaccine appears to have prevented pneumonia and other lung problems in the animals after they were exposed to the coronavirus.

Still, there is no guarantee the Oxford vaccine will ultimately prove to be successful. Studies in humans are ongoing, and this research team is one of several around the globe working at an accelerated pace to find a safe and effective vaccine for the coronavirus.

But so far, the Oxford vaccine appears to hold the most promise of becoming the first vaccine to be widely accessible, if proven to work.

Oxford scientists previously said they hope to have enough data to show the vaccine is effective by the beginning of June, and predicted the vaccine could be produced by September.",mainstream
66,"Fact check: Melinda Gates didn't exactly say Black people 'must' be vaccinated for COVID-19

The claim: Melinda Gates says Black people must be vaccinated first for COVID-19 after health care workers.

Melinda Gates, philanthropist and co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, says that after health care workers, Black people must be next in line for vaccination for COVID-19, according to a story on Live24.

Gates, in a Time magazine interview on the eve of global vaccine summit in early June, discussed how anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd, an African American man, while in custody of Minneapolis police fits into health equity, especially with development of a COVID-19 vaccine.

""The first people that need this vaccine are the 60 million health care workers around the world. They deserve to get it before anybody else. Then you start tiering,"" 24Live quoted Gates as saying in the Time story, written by Jamie Ducharme.

That quote matched the one in Time (though Live24 incorrectly identified the magazine as a newspaper). But then, instead of continuing the direct quote, the Live24 piece paraphrased Gates' subsequent statement, writing, ""Melinda went on to say that Black people in the U.S. must be vaccinated after more than 60 million health care workers around the world.""

The same headline was repeated by Health Nut News, but attributed to Time.

The Time interview did not quote Gates as saying Black people ""must be"" vaccinated after health workers. Asked who needs vaccines after health care workers, Gates told the magazine, ""in the U.S., that would be Black people next, quite honestly, and many other people of color.""

""They are having disproportionate effects from COVID-19. From there, people with underlying health conditions, and then people who are older. Those are the ones who all need it first. We also need to think about essential workers who are keeping our grocery stores open for us so we can buy food, or who are making sure that food moves through the warehouses.""

Live24 didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the way it characterized Gates' statement. Asked about the Live24 article, the Gates Foundation directed USA TODAY to the Time piece.

The Gates Foundation said at the June 4 summit it will donate $1.6 billion over five years to Gavi, a public-private partnership that helps vaccinate half the world's children against disease.

The foundation also said in an online new release that it will donate $100 million to a new Gavi effort to purchase COVID-19 vaccinations for lower-income countries so that ""everyone who needs it can have access to it, starting with health care workers and other high-risk populations.""

The headline, ""Melinda Gates says Black people must be vaccinated first for COVID-19 after health care workers"" is misleading. And it was repeated in the story. Gates did say, however, that Black people and ""many other people of color"" should be next in line for the vaccine after health care workers.

244,"A large study was able to determine more than 100 genes that are linked to autism. Getty Images
• A large genetic study provided scientists with a greater understanding of how genes cause changes in the brain that lead to autism spectrum disorder.
• Researchers analyzed more than 35,000 participant samples, including almost 12,000 from people with ASD.
• Scientists believe that both genes and environment are involved in the development of ASD, with genetics playing a big part. In the largest genetics study of its kind to date, scientists have identified 102 genes associated with the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Researchers also gained further insight into which of these genes are associated with both ASD and other disorders that cause intellectual disability and developmental delay. For the study, an international team of researchers analyzed more than 35,000 participant samples, including almost 12,000 from people with ASD. Researchers used a genetic technique called “exome sequencing,” which looks at all the regions of a person’s genetic information — or genome — that are translated into proteins. This testing can pick up rare genetic mutations that might not show up with other methods. Dr. Lonnie Zwaigenbaum, a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and the Stollery Children’s Hospital Foundation Chair in Autism at the University of Alberta, called this an “exciting” study, both for the sophisticated methods used and the large sample size. These enabled researchers to “identify a larger number of genes than ever before, which gives insight into how those genes operate and how they might increase the risk of ASD,” said Zwaigenbaum, who wasn’t involved in the research. The study results were published January 23 in the journal Cell.

ASD is a group of neurological and developmental conditions that affect communication and behavior. There’s wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms in people with ASD. Scientists believe that both genes and environment are involved in the development of ASD, with genetics playing a big part. “We know that inherited and unique mutations in the genome are a major source of risk for developing ASD, but specific causes of ASD are not yet well understood,” said Lori J. Warner, PhD, director of the Center for Human Development and Ted Lindsay Foundation HOPE Center at Beaumont Children’s Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, who wasn’t involved in the study. Although environmental factors play some role in ASD, scientific have found that there’s no link between receiving vaccines and developing ASD. The new study marks an important step forward in scientists’ understanding of the genetic basis of ASD. Researchers identified both inherited genetic mutations and de novo mutations — ones that occur spontaneously when an egg or sperm form. They also found that the ASD genes identified in the study can affect brain development or brain function. And they showed that two major types of nerve cells can be affected in ASD. Of the 102 genes identified in the study, 49 were associated with other developmental delays. “Some genes appear connected to the development of ASD, whereas others may increase risk for ASD plus severe neurodevelopmental disorder,” said Warner. “We don’t yet understand fully this process, but differentiating ASD from other disorders is important for effective treatment.” Zwaigenbaum said the overlap between ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders fits with previous research. “This study reinforces that there are many genes that may have some role in autism vulnerability, but that also have a broader role in early brain development,” said Zwaigenbaum. These genes have a “broader expression in terms of developmental abilities and challenges of the affected individual.”

While scientists now understand ASD better as a result of this study, this kind of research also points toward better ways to help children with ASD. “The greatest benefit of studies of this type is helping researchers, families, and interventionists better understand how genetic factors actually function in the developing brain and body of the individual,” said Warner, “so that treatments can be developed to ameliorate or completely block the disruptive changes that lead to disorders such as ASD.” But Zwaigenbaum cautions that the results of the study will not lead to clinical benefits right away. “There’s a lot of translational work that would still need to happen in order to assess whether the findings from this study will directly inform assessment, diagnosis, or treatment,” he said. Still, he said the results provide direction for future research into potential biological treatments, as well as genetic tests that could allow earlier diagnosis of ASD. Warner said there are medications currently approved for use in children with ASD, but they address symptoms like agitation or anxiety, rather than the core social or behavioral deficits of ASD. Early diagnosis is another goal of ASD research, because “the sooner children are identified and appropriately assessed, the sooner families can receive needed supports,” said Warner. But ASD is a complex condition, so genetic diagnosis isn’t always straightforward. “Although studies like this continue to expand our appreciation for the increasing number of genes associated with ASD, the reality is that a genetic cause is seldom identified in most children with ASD — even with the most sophisticated genetic testing,” said Andrew Adesman, MD, chief of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Queens, New York, who wasn’t involved in the study. But he said there’s still value in parents of a child with ASD seeking out genetic testing, especially as genetic technologies advance. “There have been steady gains in terms of the diagnostic ‘yield’ of genetic testing,” said Adesman. “For this reason, parents of children with ASD may wish to discuss with their pediatrician whether their child should have the newer genetic tests done.” In the absence of a simple test for ASD, there are still things parents can do for their children. “The single most important things families and healthcare providers can do is to be aware of the risk factors and early , and get connected with needed services as soon as possible,” said Warner.",mainstream
163,"Monika Fleshner, a neuroimmunophysiologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, has shown that short-term stress can even boost immunity. It's one of the body's natural defense systems. So, if the immune system is indeed critical to how the body processes chronic stress, short-term stress might help build the body’s defenses against stress itself.

Brachman doesn’t want to completely cut off a person’s stress response, as that could prove counterproductive. Instead, she’s seeking a way for people to stop the response before it turns dangerous—before it triggers mental illness. It’s a mission she landed on somewhat accidentally while completing a fellowship at the National Institutes of Health, where she researched how the immune system—specifically, a compromised immune system—is related to depression. She was particularly interested in whether depression influenced the immune system, or if the immune system helped trigger depression.

Working with 12 mice, her team transferred immune cells from depressive-like mice into new mice that had not been exposed to stress or displayed depressive behaviors. The team expected the new mice either to develop a typical physiological response to stress (inflammation, increased heart rate) or to show no changes. But when they actually stressed the new mice—by putting them in cages with more aggressive animals, forcing them to swim, and other standard lab methods—the results, and those of subsequent studies, showed the opposite: The new mice were more resilient to stress.

The immune cells from the depressed mice appeared to immunize the new mice against stress-induced depressive symptoms, as if they were a vaccine.

By the time Brachman’s results were published, in January 2015, she’d long since moved on to and completed a doctoral program at Columbia University, where she had begun collaborating with the neurobiologist Christine Denny.* In the course of her career, Denny had seen thousands of mice anesthetized with ketamine, the drug also known as special-K, for various studies, and recognized that there were lasting effects. Ketamine was by then also being used to treat depression in adults. Brachman and Denny decided to test whether ketamine had any effect on how mice react to stress. They gave the drug to lab mice, waited one week, then put those mice, as well as untreated mice, through stressful situations. The study results showed that for up to four weeks after the injection, the mice that were given ketamine were more social and less afraid than the control animals. They also exhibited fewer depressive-like symptoms after facing stressful situations.

Brachman’s results consistently showed that there are ways to build resilience to stress, by both injecting immune cells from another animal and giving a dose of ketamine prior to stress. This runs counter to the long-accepted notion that stress leads to illness because of risk factors such as genetic mutations, compromised immune systems, and prior exposures. Perhaps the relationship between stress and illness has more to do with a person’s level of resilience—and perhaps specific interventions could boost this.",mainstream
372,"Health officials are urging people to have both parts of the MMR vaccine after cases of mumps in England reached their highest level in a decade.

Outbreaks in universities and colleges raised the number of cases of the painful viral illness to 5,042 in 2019 - four times the number in 2018.

Most were in young adults who missed out on the MMR jab.

Public Health England said the full two doses of the vaccination were needed to maximise protection.
• Mumps: Why adults might still need the MMR jab

The vaccine prevents most cases of mumps - but not all, and so some young people are still getting the illness.

There were also increases in mumps cases in Wales and Scotland in 2019.

It is a viral infection that used to be very common in children before the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1988.

A classic sign is puffy cheeks under the ears.

Mumps is contagious and spread through infected droplets of saliva breathed in through the mouth or nose.

What are the symptoms?
• painful swelling of the glands at the side of the face

Most people usually recover without treatment.

But in rare cases, there can be serious complications, such as inflammation of the testicles in males, meningitis and deafness.

What does it feel like?

""I went to bed normal, everything fine, and then I woke up, and bang - my face was so puffed out, so swollen,"" says Olly Finch, a student at Leeds University.

""I got prescribed morphine - it was that bad.""

Flora Cox, another Leeds student, said: ""It started out with just neck pain in my ear and jaw, and then it started swelling - it was so painful.

David Buckley, 32, ended up with a swollen testicle ""the size of an avocado"" when he had mumps.

That followed 10 days at home in bed with symptoms and a trip to hospital with a locked jaw.

""It was so painful, really horrible. I tried to ice it... but it's just something you have to ride out,"" he told Radio 1 Newsbeat.

David wasn't sure if he'd had the second dose of the MMR vaccine, so he got the jab again - just in case.
• Mumps - is it the forgotten disease?

How can I protect myself?

The best and safest way is to get two doses of the MMR vaccine - the middle 'M' stands for mumps.

It's never too late to catch up, says Dr Vanessa Saliba, from Public Health England.

""We encourage all students and young people who may have missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past to contact their GP practice and get up to date as soon as possible,"" she said.

Adults and children who missed out on the vaccine as babies can also have it on the NHS at any age - it is given in two doses, with the second at least a month after the first.

Why do some people still get mumps?

The part of the triple vaccine that specifically protects against mumps isn't quite as effective as the elements protecting against measles and rubella.

However, getting the jab is still crucial - because the more people who are protected, the less likely mumps is to be shared around.

During outbreaks among students, which are common, completely unvaccinated people are at highest risk.

Even if you get the illness after being vaccinated, you are likely to have a less serious form of it and fewer complications.

Cases of mumps consistently outnumber measles and rubella cases every year.

Teenagers and young adults in colleges and universities are now the ones who tend to be affected - for several reasons.

Many of the 2019 cases were born in the late 1990s and early 2000s and missed out on the MMR vaccine when they were children.

Research by a disgraced UK doctor falsely linking the vaccine to autism undoubtedly had an impact on uptake.

Current students may also be too old to have been immunised or offered the MMR, or may only have had one dose of the vaccine and thus not be fully protected.

It is also possible the vaccine's protection against mumps may have worn off.

Despite the recent rise in cases, mumps hasn't just reappeared.

Before the MMR vaccine, eight out of 10 people developed it and most of them were children of school age.

At that time, there were five deaths a year from mumps, mainly due to encephalitis or swelling of the brain.

The illness then became relatively rare before returning in the 2000s.

There was a particularly large outbreak (43,000 cases) in 2005.",mainstream

Vaccines often take several years to develop, and Trump’s top health advisers have frequently warned that it may take at least a year before people can begin to receive a coronavirus vaccine.

The company has not yet begun human trials, and doesn’t expect to do so until September of this year. Two other companies have said they have the potential to supply millions of doses by the end of the year if their vaccine candidate shows promising results in trials.

Trump is shepherding within his administration aimed at drastically slashing the timeline for vaccine development, an undertaking his aides have compared to the sprint to develop the atomic bomb. But last week, Trump denied to reporters that he was over-promising with his goal of securing 300 million doses of the eventual vaccine once it’s ready to be administered to the public.

“We’re building supply lines. We even have the final vaccine,” he said on Sunday.

Trump’s top public health experts have expressed cautious optimism that finalizing a vaccine on the president’s declared timeline is possible — with caveats.",mainstream
1323,"The most effective way of preventing the flu is with an influenza vaccination. Every fall you should be immunized against strains that have developed since the previous outbreak. If you are vaccinated against three or more strains, you may still come down with flu, but symptoms are likely to be milder than they would have been had you not had an influenza vaccination.

Influenza vaccine is available through physicians and public-health facilities and many companies provide flu vaccines on-site for their workers. Because influenza is a serious threat, the CDC recommends vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older and others at high risk of flu complications:
• Those with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and asthma
• People with a weakened immune system, like those with HIV/AIDS

The seasonal flu vaccine is available in three forms. One is the injectable vaccine made from an inactivated virus. This form is usually given as a single injection and is approved for people 6 months of age or older.

Another form is given as a nasal spray called FluMist. This form of the vaccine is a live and weakened form of the flu and is approved for all healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant. If you are pregnant you can only receive the injectable form. The CDC also has recommended the nasal spray vaccine for healthy children 2 years and older without preference over the flu shot.

There is also a “needle-less” option for people 18-64 years old: the jet injector vaccine with Afluria, which uses a tool with high pressure to deliver the vaccine.

All of the vaccines are given as a single dose, although children who are receiving vaccination for the first time receive two. Some people develop low fever and muscle aches as side effects of the vaccine.
• Intradermal shots use smaller needles that only go into the top layer of the skin instead of the muscle. They're available for those ages 18 to 64. If you have severe egg allergies you should get the flu shot from a doctor who can treat a severe allergic reaction -- either at your doctor's office, a hospital, a clinic, or a health department.
• Egg-free vaccines are now available for those aged 18 and older who have severe egg allergies.
• High-dose vaccines are meant for those ages 65 and older, when available, and may better protect this group from the flu.",mainstream

860,"Photos: Volunteers in Seattle get first doses of trial vaccine for COVID-19

The first shots in the first vaccine trial for the new coronavirus were administered Monday as a small group of volunteers in Seattle will receive varying doses over the next several weeks to test the safety of the experimental vaccine.

Doctors at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle gave the first shots in the trial aimed at combating the spread of COVID-19.

""Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,"" National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said in a statement. ""This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.""

SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes COVID-19, which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic last week. More than 183,400 cases globally have been reported, with more than 7,100 confirmed deaths, since the virus was first detected in late 2019 in China.

The trial is to include 45 healthy adults ages 18-55 and last for approximately 6 weeks as volunteers will receive two shots about a month apart.

Developed by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., the experimental vaccine uses messenger RNA and ""directs the body’s cells to express a virus protein that it is hoped will elicit a robust immune response,"" the institute said in a news release.

Scientists working on a vaccine for Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by another coronavirus, were able to develop the COVID-19 experimental vaccine quickly once the genetic information for the new coronavirus became available.

What exactly is a virus? Is it alive?

Coronaviruses are named for crown-like spikes on their surfaces, and the potential COVID-19 vaccine targets the spike, which allow the viruses to attack the human body.

Dr. Lisa Jackson, who is leading the study with Kaiser Permanente, told the Associated Press that her team is ""subdued"" as the trial gets underway. The potential vaccine is one of many being developed around the globe, and it could still take more than a year for it to be widely available if it is proven safe.

“We don’t know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response or whether it will be safe. That’s why we’re doing a trial,” Jackson told the Associated Press.

But, ""going from not even knowing that this virus was out there … to have any vaccine"" in testing in about two months is unprecedented, she added.

Social distancing: It’s not about you, it’s about us

""We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,"" Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle told the AP. She's one of the first people who will take part in the trial.

""I'm feeling great,"" she added after getting the shot.

Other recipients of the first round of the vaccine were Neal Browning, 46, of Bothell, Washington. He told the AP his daughters were proud of him for being part of the trial.

""Every parent wants their children to look up to them,"" he said. But he said he told them not to brag to friends. ""It's other people, too. It's not just Dad out there.""

Rebecca Sirull, 25, said she joined the trial as ""a way to contribute to the situation in a positive way.""

""The main guidelines that we all have right now are to stay home and do nothing, which is sort of a hard message to hear when you want to help out,"" she said.",mainstream
1096,"FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Drugmakers are warning of a potential shortage of vials to bottle future COVID-19 vaccines, but their rush to secure supplies risks making matters worse, some major medical equipment manufacturers warn.

Schott AG, the world’s largest maker of speciality glass for vaccine vials, says it has turned down requests to reserve output from major pharmaceutical firms because it does not want to commit resources before it is clear which vaccines will work.

“We have to keep the door open to give capacity to those who really are successful in the end. We don’t want to be portrayed in the press as the ones who were unable to package the best vaccine,” Chief Executive Frank Heinricht told Reuters.

With thousands dying from COVID-19 every day and attempts to contain the virus plunging the world into recession, drugmakers and healthcare groups including Pfizer, AstraZeneca and the GAVI vaccines alliance are pushing to mass produce vaccines even before they are shown to work in trials.

They want to be sure a successful jab can be rolled out as quickly as possible to billions of people across the world.

But that is creating worries about supplies.

AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot; the head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Richard Hatchett; and the director general of global drugmakers’ lobby group IFPMA, Thomas Cueni, have all warned there may not be enough glass vials available for a global immunisation campaign.

Privately-held Schott, the biggest supplier of borosilicate glass for medical bottles and syringes, is confident vial makers can meet the challenge, but says it has had to make some very difficult business decisions to try to ensure that is the case.

Heinricht said Schott had turned down requests from major vaccine developers for future delivery of 800 million to 1 billion glass vials, which typically hold 5-10 doses, because the company believed it was too early to make such a commitment.

“That is the dilemma we are in,” Heinricht said, adding Schott’s cautious stance may have contributed to an industry view that vials, which drugmakers buy for less than 10 euro cents apiece, may become in short supply.

France’s SGD Pharma, a maker of vials and one of the world’s largest manufacturers of moulded glass for the pharmaceutical industry, said it had a public health duty and would do everything to avoid vial shortages.

“We trust our clients, with whom we have long standing relationships, not to make speculative moves. If this was to be the case, we would put the reputation and the mission of SGD above any cash gain,” Chief Executive Christophe Nicoli said.

He sought to allay concerns over shortages, saying SGD expected an additional pandemic demand for vials of no more than 3% of underlying annual volumes. Schott, whose founder Otto Schott invented heavy-duty borosilicate glass in the 1890s, also said it was pulling out all the stops for its part in supplying a billion multi-dose vials which it says will be needed for a global immunisation drive, potentially next year.

Schott, with 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in annual sales, competes in the market for borosilicate glass tubes with Nippon Electric Glass, Nipro and Corning Inc.

It also makes the finished bottles, or vials, where it competes in a more fragmented market with companies including SGD, Germany’s Gerresheimer and Italy’s Stevanato Group.

Corning this week won $204 million in U.S. government funding to boost output of its vials for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. That came a day after the U.S. government awarded $143 million to SiO2 Materials Science to boost production of its vials and syringes.

Schott’s Heinricht said the industry supplies about 50 billion medical borosilicate containers per year, of which 15-20 billion are medical vials, even without a pandemic. The glass type is favoured by the pharma industry because it does not react with contents.

Schott and its peers will manage to add about 1 billion vials likely needed for a global immunisation effort, he said. That would require a vial to be used for multiple injections.

Schott has invested in glass and vial production over recent years because China is switching to higher-quality borosilicate containers, standing the company in good stead for the pandemic, and 200 million euros were earmarked for new production lines this year.

“The day a vaccine nears approval we will be ready and I am certain that not only we but also our competitors will deliver,” said Heinricht.",mainstream
1233,"After winning a small grant for early vaccine work in March, Novavax just won the largest-ever investment from CEPI, a global coalition aiding COVID-19 vaccine development.

The grant of up to $384 million from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations will fund Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine testing through phase 2, plus early work to scale-up manufacturing. The funding follows a $4 million award back in March.

The Maryland biotech will use the funds to conduct a phase 1/2 trial on its candidate, NVX-COV2373, starting with the phase 1 portion in Australia this month. After phase 1 results—expected in July—the phase 2 portion is slated for multiple countries, Novavax said.

Beyond testing, the company intends to use part of the funds to scale up production to make up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020. The company aims to make more than 1 billion doses in 2021.

Novavax's COVID-19 candidate is a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine combined with the company's Matrix-M adjuvant. The platform recently succeeded in a phase 3 trial for NanoFlu, a quadrivalent influenza shot, in adults 65 and older.

Aside from Novavax, CEPI has awarded COVID-19 vaccine R&D funds to Moderna, Inovio and Curevac, plus the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, the University of Queensland and a group led by Institut Pasteur.

“Our vaccine R&D programs are starting to show progress, so it is vital that we invest now to boost manufacturing capacity, so that our partners have the ability to produce vaccines at a global scale,” CEPI CEO Richard Hatchett said in a statement. “We still have a long way to go, but we’re making important steps forward to deliver a safe, effective, and globally accessible vaccine as quickly as possible.”

RELATED: Pfizer plans to farm out manufacturing for some of its drugs to make way for COVID-19 vaccine

In recent days, some of the leading companies involved in the COVID-19 vaccine race have talked up their progress and timelines. On Monday, Pfizer said it's planning to work with contract manufacturers to establish U.S.- and Europe-based supply chains to make some of its existing meds, including sterile injectables. That effort is necessary as the company dedicates considerable resources to a potential COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Last week, Moderna said it aims to launch a phase 3 study for its mRNA vaccine candidate in the “early summer.” Under that timeline, the company could score a full FDA nod next year.

Aside from those companies, Johnson & Johnson is involved in the COVID-19 vaccine R&D effort, as are partners Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline. AstraZeneca has signed on to produce vaccines for the University of Oxford project. In all, the World Health Organization is tracking eight programs in human testing and more than 100 programs in preclinical testing.",mainstream
560,"It is an everyday miracle, mysterious and beguiling, and it is replicated several thousand times over, at all hours, in churches that are beautiful and churches that are not. The priest consecrates the bread, and then he consecrates the wine, and there on the altar the meal becomes the body and blood of Christ. Then, just as Jesus broke bread and shared wine with the apostles at the Last Supper, believers rise from the pews, receive the host, eat it, and, one by one, drink the Precious Blood, putting their lips to the same cup.

That last part doesn’t happen these days. Churches are closed and services have been moved online, for one, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also advised against it. Before the pandemic, William Ouweleen had drunk from such a cup countless times. A vintner in the Finger Lakes region of New York, he used to attend mass and receive communion at St. Matthew Church, in Livonia, where the Precious Blood in the chalice had been a blush-colored wine that he’d made. Ouweleen runs a winery named O-Neh-Da, which makes sacramental wine that churches use to celebrate the Eucharist. The winery, which is next to Hemlock Lake—“o-neh-da” is the Seneca word for “hemlock”—is the go-to for Catholics in the Northeast. When Pope Francis visited New York City, in 2015, he used O-Neh-Da wine for a mass at Madison Square Garden.

In contrast to regular wine, which might be made with extra yeast, tannin powders, and flavorings, Communion wine must be “natural, from the fruit of the grape, pure and incorrupt, not mixed with other substances,” according to Vatican instructions. So, last fall, Ouweleen, a self-described “hippie” who is fifty-eight and wears his hair in dreadlocks, did what he does every fall: he harvested forty acres’ worth of grapes, trucked them to his winery, crushed them, and allowed them to ferment with no additives. (Except, that is, for some added sulfites, just before bottling—a preservative sanctioned by the Vatican.)

By springtime, he had fifty thousand gallons of wine in his cellar. This time of year, he would usually be filling fifteen hundred wine bottles per day, in order to deliver them to churches in New York and Pennsylvania, and to religious-goods stores as far away as Florida and Guam. But he isn’t doing that this year, because it would mean purchasing glass bottles to fill with wine that might not sell. Ouweleen doesn’t know when the churches will reopen. This past Friday, President Trump deemed houses of worship “essential” and asked all governors to allow them “to open right now, for this weekend,” but, in New York, houses of worship can only fully reopen in the last phase of the state’s four-part reopening plan, along with stadiums and amusement parks. Ouweleen is also not sure that, when they do reopen, they will continue to serve consecrated wine, which, in most of the country’s Catholic churches, is drunk from a chalice that is shared by the entire congregation.

So he decided to ask them. Last month, Ouweleen typed up a letter to the bishop in Albany, to ask if he had any foresight on the future of sacramental wine. A week later, still awaiting a reply, Ouweleen broadened his query, writing to more than a thousand parishes—all customers of his—to ask if they plan to distribute the Eucharist by chalice, once church services resume. In his letter to the priests, Ouweleen explained that O-Neh-Da had survived—by God’s grace—several wars, the Great Depression, and Prohibition, but, “the Good Lord helps those who help themselves, so we are taking an active role in planning for the other side of this pandemic.”

Ouweleen figured that the wine in his cellar would last for about a year before its taste started to fade. “I’ll know what to do with that wine when I know what to do,” he said. “This graceful hand of the unseen has been very present in my life, and I respect that.” In the meantime, he continued checking in on his vineyard. By September, his vines will have produced two hundred tons of grapes, which will yield another forty thousand gallons of wine. It was getting warm, and the vines were about to bud.

There are three major sacramental wineries in the United States: Mont La Salle and Cribari, both in California, and O-Neh-Da, in New York, which is the smallest and the oldest. Established in 1872 by Bishop Bernard McQuaid, the first bishop of Rochester, O-Neh-Da was originally run by seminarians, and, later, by monks. In 2002, it was purchased by Steven Goldstone, who’d recently retired as the C.E.O. of RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco conglomerate, and who’d seen a notice in the Wall Street Journal advertising a winery for sale in the Finger Lakes. (Goldstone, a private pilot, liked to fly over the region in his plane.)

In 2007, there was another ad—this time, in the PennySaver, for a rental house on the O-Neh-Da Winery’s property, which would cost eight hundred and fifty dollars a month. Ouweleen responded to it; he and his wife, Lisa Woodhams, and his stepson, Jacob, were facing eviction from their home in Conesus. The family was continuously hard up—Ouweleen was the manager of an organic market that was trying (and failing) to compete with Wegmans—and they were searching for a gentler, more Christ-like life. (They wrote a prayer: “Land with a view / a ridge line or two … a place to grow / with maintenance kept low / sanctuary where / we reap what we sow.” “Divinity,” it concluded, “make it so.”) The rental, an old winemaker’s house built in the twenties, with three bedrooms, and a lot of bats in the attic, felt fated.

The family moved in and learned, upon their arrival, that the winery on the grounds wasn’t doing too well. (They had regular encounters with the winemaker, who kept knocking on their door, asking if they had any spare trash bags or light bulbs.) Ouweleen was also looking for a new job, so he called Goldstone and told him, “I think I’m supposed to be here to help you with this winery.”

Goldstone flew north to meet with Ouweleen, who had prepared a PowerPoint presentation on what he described as the brand’s “natural assets,” such as its long, almost romantic history of sequestered religious men ministering to its grapes. Ouweleen had no experience in wine-making, but, Goldstone said later, “It’s not like I had a long line of prestigious winemakers waiting to be interviewed for the job.” Goldstone decided, of Ouweleen and his family, that “they belong there.” The two men worked out an arrangement in which Ouweleen would run O-Neh-Dah. A year later, Woodhams joined him. (She’d been bartending and waiting tables until she was sure that this sacramental winery gig was going to work out.)

Together with one other full-time employee and several part-time staff, Ouweleen and Woodhams do the work of a hundred unpaid monks. Ouweleen plays Reggae for the fermenting grapes—“conscious music,” he said, “to encourage them”—and tastes and adjusts the wine. He also fixes the bottle-capper, and the crusher, and the labeller, and the filler, and the air-compressor, and the tractor, when they break. Woodhams pays the bills, answers the phones, puts together wholesale orders, and coördinates the family’s appearances at wine tastings. Friends help them bottle the wine.

“It’s like if a Catholic school lost all their nuns,” Ouweleen said. “It’s noble but unprofitable work.” This is true even when there’s no pandemic. (O-Neh-Da charges about eighty dollars for a case of twelve bottles of sacramental wine, and the average church customer orders twenty cases of wine a year.) But it has been a reliable source of income, which, for Ouweleen, feels nothing short of miraculous. In the spring, when the grapevines begin to sprout, the robins are loudest in the mornings and the woodpeckers are busiest in the evenings. In the fall, when the grapes are harvested—first the Rosette, then the Delaware—the lake reflects the orange of the trees. Every year is different but also the same. The family has been able to count on it.",mainstream
74,"This week, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced it will donate A$10 million to help fund an Australian trial testing whether a very old vaccine, BCG, can be used against a new threat, COVID-19.

So what is the BCG vaccine and what might its place be in the fight against coronavirus?

The BCG vaccine has been used for nearly a century to protect against tuberculosis, a bacterial disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

BCG is short for Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, as it was created by Léon Charles Albert Calmette and Jean-Marie Camille Guérin in the early 1900s.

To make the vaccine, they used Mycobacterium bovis, a bacterium found in cows and closely related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They grew it on a nutrient-rich jelly in the lab for nearly 13 years. The bacterium adapted to this comfortable lifestyle by losing elements in its DNA it no longer needed, including elements that cause disease.

This process is called attenuation and it results in a live but weakened microbe that can be given to humans as a vaccine.

Read more: Coronavirus: could the pandemic be controlled using existing vaccines like MMR or BCG?

BCG is offered to infants in some parts of the world where there are still high rates of tuberculosis. It protects 86% of the time against some rarer forms of tuberculosis more common in children.

But it only protects about 50% of the time in adults.

Scientists and clinicians generally feel we need a better vaccine for tuberculosis. However, epidemiologists have noticed children who received BCG had significantly better overall health, with fewer respiratory infections and fewer deaths.

Immunologists suspect this is caused by a type of immune response called “trained immunity”.

Trained immunity is distinct from how we traditionally think of immunity, or “immune memory”, because it engages different types of immune cells.

There are two main types of cells within our immune system: innate cells, which respond rapidly to microbes that cause disease, and adaptive cells, which initially respond quite slowly.

Adaptive cells include B cells, which make antibodies to block infection, and T cells, which can kill infected cells. Importantly, adaptive cells can remember particular microbes for years, or even decades, after we first encounter them.

When adaptive immune cells encounter the same microbe a second or subsequent time, they respond much more quickly, and the immune system can effectively clear an infection before it causes disease. Immune memory is why often we don’t get infected with a specific microbe, like chickenpox, more than once.

Most of our current vaccines exploit immune memory to protect us from infection.

Read more: Where are we at with developing a vaccine for coronavirus?

For decades, scientists believed innate cells lacked the ability to remember previous encounters with microbes. However, we’ve recently learnt some innate cells, such as monocytes, can be “trained” during an encounter with a microbe. Training can program innate cells to activate more quickly when they next encounter a microbe – any microbe.

Some live attenuated vaccines, such as BCG, can trigger trained immunity, which can enhance early control of other infections. This raises the tantalising possibility that BCG could train innate cells to improve early control of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to reduce COVID-19 disease or even prevent infection.

And as a bonus, BCG could potentially protect us against other pathogens too.

We don’t know yet whether BCG will reduce the severity of COVID-19, but the vaccine has some interesting features.

First, BCG is a potent stimulator of the immune system. Currently, it’s used alongside other therapies to treat bladder cancer and melanoma, because it can stimulate immune cells to attack the tumour.

BCG also seems to benefit lung immunity. As we mentioned, children who have had the vaccine appear to get fewer respiratory infections.

There’s a study underway in Melbourne looking at whether BCG can reduce symptoms of asthma in children.

And finally, BCG has been shown to limit viral infection. In one study, human volunteers were given BCG or a placebo one month before being infected with a virus. Volunteers who received BCG had a modest reduction in the amount of virus produced during infection compared to those who received the placebo.

Read more: Explainer: what is TB and am I at risk of getting it in Australia?

However, BCG can cause side-effects to be mindful of. It usually causes a small raised blister on the skin at the vaccine site and it can cause painful swelling in the surrounding lymph nodes.

Importantly, because it’s a live bacterium, it can spread from the vaccine site and cause disease, called disseminated BCG, in people who are immunodeficient, like people with HIV. This means BCG can’t be given to everyone.

The ultimate test of BCG as a preventative measure for COVID-19 is to run randomised clinical trials, which are now underway.

Researchers across Australia and the Netherlands are preparing to give BCG to the people who have arguably the highest risk of COVID-19: frontline health-care workers.

These phase III trials will collect data on whether workers vaccinated with BCG have fewer or less severe COVID-19 infections.

If BCG is shown to be effective, we’ll face other challenges. For example, supply of the vaccine is currently limited. Further, there are many different strains of BCG and they might not all provide the same protection against COVID-19.

Protection would likely start to wane relatively quickly. When trained immunity was tracked in humans after BCG, it started waning from three to 12 months after vaccination.

Protection would also not be as strong as what we see with many traditional vaccines, such as the MMR vaccine which protects against measles 94.1% of the time.

Read more: Here's why the WHO says a coronavirus vaccine is 18 months away

So BCG would be most helpful for people at high risk of exposure, but it wouldn’t replace a traditional vaccine based on immune memory.

These studies are important to give us options. We need a complete toolkit for control of COVID-19, consisting of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory drugs and vaccines. But an effective COVID-19 vaccine is likely still many months, even years, away.

By repurposing an old, well-characterised vaccine, we could bridge this gap and provide some protection to our health-care workers as they confront COVID-19.",mainstream
30,"China Caught Shutting Down COVID-19 Research to ‘Control the Narrative’

China has been caught shutting down research into COVID-19 in an apparent attempt to ""control the narrative"" of the coronavirus pandemic, leading analysts have revealed.

The websites for two of China's leading universities recently published academic research about the origins of the coronavirus.

However, the studies were then deleted from both websites and scrubbed from the state-controlled Internet, according to a report.

In a possible bid to ""control the narrative"" surrounding the pandemic, the posts on the websites of the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and Fudan University were erased from online caches, The Guardian reported.

Wuhan's university appears to have published and then deleted posts about academic research that needed to be approved by China’s ministry of science and technology before publication.

Posts originally published on April 9 by the school of information science and technology at Fudan University in Shanghai were also deleted in a similar apparent censorship effort.

“They are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,” Kevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, told The Guardian.

“There is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face … that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after SARS,” he added.

China’s science and technology ministry had announced on April 3 that academic researchers needed to report their coronavirus findings to officials within three days or be terminated.

The news outlet noted that China’s President Xi Jinping published an essay in March that included “tracing the origin of the virus” a national priority; the science and technology ministry referenced the essay shortly before the universities changed tunes.

On New Year’s Eve, China informed the World Health Organization of a “mysterious pneumonia outbreak” spreading through Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million.

The government closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak, moved all patients with the virus to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to government laboratories.

Doctors were told to stay quiet; one who issued a warning online was punished.

He later died of the virus.

The Pentagon was said to have first learned about the new coronavirus in December from open-source reports emanating from China.

By early January, warnings about the virus had made their way into intelligence reports circulating around the government.

On Jan. 3, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], Robert Redfield, received a call from his Chinese counterpart with an official warning.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said he was alerted to the virus around the same time — and within two weeks was fearful it could bring about a global catastrophe.

Quickly, U.S. intelligence and public health officials started doubting China’s reported rates of infection and death toll.

They pressed China to allow in U.S. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the U.S. response.

U.S. officials also pressed China to send samples of the virus to U.S. labs for study and for vaccine and test development.

That same day, the National Institutes of Health started working on a vaccine.

Ultimately, the U.S. was able to get China’s consent to send two people on the WHO team that traveled to China later in the month.

But by then precious weeks had been lost and the virus had raced across Asia and had started to escape the continent.",conspiracy
1133,"Nothing can stop a global outbreak in its tracks better than a vaccine. Unfortunately, creating a vaccine capable of preventing the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 will probably take at least a year to 18 months, health officials say.

“That is the time frame,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week. Anyone who says they can do it faster “will be cutting corners that would be detrimental.”

While there are about 10 vaccine candidates in the works — and at least one of them could begin clinical trials in April — it would still take about three more months to conduct the first stage of human testing and another eight months or so to complete the next stage of the trial process, he added.

New vaccines require copious research and time-consuming testing that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There’s no guarantee of success, but even if everything goes well, the final product might not hit the market until after an outbreak has subsided.

Here’s a look at how vaccines are made and why the process takes so long.

Your body has a multi-pronged defense system for recognizing and combating dangerous invaders: your white blood cells. There are several types, each with a different purpose:
• Macrophages engulf and then eat pathogens or cells that are dead or damaged. They leave behind identifying fragments of the invading microbes. These fragments are called antigens.
• B-lymphocytes produce antibodies that recognize and bind to those antigens. If a pathogen with those antigens shows up in the blood stream again, those antibodies can mount an attack.
• If those pathogens are already hiding out inside your cells beyond the antibodies’ reach, T-lymphocytes can attack those infected cells.

Your immune system has to go through this process each time it encounters a threat from a new virus or bacterium.

A vaccine provides a shortcut. Essentially, it helps your immune system learn to recognize a specific threat by tricking it into thinking it’s under attack. Then it can produce the antibodies it needs without having to face a real infection.

Are all vaccines the same?

Nope. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes several types of vaccines:
• Attenuated vaccines, like those for chickenpox and measles, use a live virus or bacteria that has been intentionally weakened so that it can’t cause serious disease in a healthy immune system.
• Inactivated vaccines, such as the one for polio, use germs that have been killed. They typically don’t provide as much immunity as attenuated vaccines, so they may require boosters over time.
• Toxoid vaccines, including the DTaP vaccine for diphtheria and tetanus, use weakened versions of the toxins created by invading bacteria to teach the body how to fight the pathogens.
• Subunit vaccines, such as DTaP’s whooping cough component, only use fragments of the virus or bacterium they protect against.
• Conjugate vaccines teach the immune system to fight bacteria that try to disguise their antigens in the long chains of sugar molecules that form the walls of bacterial cells.

What do you need to know about a virus to create a vaccine?

The immune system learns how to fight a virus by studying its face — the outside of the particle, including those telltale antigens. So a vaccine needs to give your body a snapshot of that face.

One classic technique involves injecting a person with a killed virus. Another uses live viruses that have been grown and deliberately weakened, typically by removing specific genes in their RNA or DNA.

Both of these strategies take some time, and scientists worry that if they use them on novel viruses, they may not behave the way researchers predict, said Dr. Kathryn Stephenson, who runs the clinical trial unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s Center for Virology and Vaccine Research.

Another option for scientists is to reconstruct that snapshot using information from a virus’ genetic code, which may be made of either RNA or DNA.

Nowadays, researchers can get started fast. Scientists in China made the coronavirus’ RNA sequences available on Jan. 10, and many labs began working toward a vaccine the next day, Stephenson said.

Once you know that, is the rest easy?

Hardly. Designing the vaccine is just the first step. Then it has to be produced.

There are many different vaccine-making platforms, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

“What would make a great vaccine for coronavirus is one that you can make quickly and one that would provide long-lasting and effective immunity,” Stephenson said. “Those are not always the same thing.”

For example, a vaccine based on the virus’ genome can be made quickly, in perhaps a month or two, but it may be harder to manufacture in giant quantities.

Another option is to take the virus’ genetic snapshot and put it into a different virus for transport. When introduced into the body, the so-called viral vector vaccine enters cells, prompting them to produce huge numbers of this snapshot for the immune system to see. These vaccines take longer to make — say, six to eight months — but they can be scaled up more readily.

“A lot of us are working on both of those,” Stephenson said.

Before a vaccine candidate is approved for use, it must be proven safe and effective in a series of trials that are monitored by the Food and Drug Administration.

The first step is to show that it’s safe in preclinical studies. These can be conducted in vitro (using cells in a laboratory dish) or in vivo (using an animal as a stand-in for humans). Finding the right animal for testing can be a challenge, said Robert Grenfell, director of health and biosecurity at CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, but scientists working on a vaccine for the new coronavirus won’t have to start from scratch. The new virus shares much of its genome with the coronavirus that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and some Australian researchers already have been studying the SARS virus in ferrets.

Then clinical trials in humans can begin. Phase 1 trials are small, usually with a few dozen closely monitored participants. The main goal here is to make sure the vaccine is safe. Phase 2 trials typically enroll hundreds of patients to expand the safety assessment and allow scientists to dig into the body’s immune response. Phase 3 trials can enroll thousands of people, typically with some of them randomly assigned to get the vaccine and some getting a placebo.

This process can take years under normal circumstances. In an emergency, it could be sped up dramatically.

The big sticking point is often the Phase 3 trial. In an epidemic, many study volunteers may not want to risk getting a placebo instead of the vaccine, Stephenson said.

Researchers faced this dilemma during the Western African Ebola outbreak that took off in 2014. The virus had a mortality rate of about 40%, making people desperate for the still-unproven vaccine. So researchers employed a novel experimental design that involved vaccinating people with varying degrees of separation from an Ebola patient and using computer models to help determine if the vaccine had had an effect.

“I think people learned from that that there are ways to be creative,” Stephenson said. A creative solution may be needed when a coronavirus vaccine is ready for Phase 3 testing, she added.

How good does a vaccine need to be in order to gain approval?

The FDA wants it to be both safe and effective — in other words, it has to protect enough people with as few unwanted side effects as possible. But exactly what qualifies as safe and effective may depend on the disease in question.

For some perspective: Stephenson, who also studies HIV, said that researchers would be very happy if they could come up with an HIV vaccine that protected 50% or so of those who got it. On the other hand, for a highly contagious virus like measles, a vaccine would need to work in almost everyone to establish herd immunity, she said.

David Weiner, a molecular immunologist who directs the Wistar Institute’s Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, said a successful coronavirus vaccine wouldn’t have to be 100% effective.

“I would like us to see it work in the majority of people,” he said, but “if it worked in 50%, 50% is a big improvement over 0%.”

Once a vaccine is approved, is the hard part over?

Definitely not. The labs that create a successful vaccine probably won’t be the ones that are able to scale up — they’ll need a dedicated manufacturer for that part. And many companies may be wary of investing the resources it takes to manufacture a new vaccine when the epidemic could end before there’s a chance to bring it to market, Weiner said.

“Big Pharma is afraid to go in because the outbreaks end and they lose all the money they put in,” he said. That’s why the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, has stepped in with funding to help shepherd some of those efforts, he added.

One of the big technical challenges in large-scale manufacturing is quality control, Stephenson said.

“Every vaccine has its own particular issue,” she said, but “the manufacturing challenges mainly have the most to do with safety precautions and making sure that when you’re done, the vial of vaccine has in it what you say it has.”

Who would get the vaccine first?

This can be a difficult question when there’s a limited amount of vaccine and a whole lot of demand.

Since older adults appear to be most at risk from COVID-19, it’s likely that health officials would focus on them first, Stephenson said.

Medical professionals — who are both at high risk of exposure and are needed to care for those who are sick — would likely be a priority as well.

“Front-line healthcare workers are usually one of the first groups you vaccinate because you need your workforce in place,” she said.

Vaccines are often less effective in older people than they are in younger ones, and this could affect the way that a vaccine is administered. A vaccine might be given in multiple doses, or an adjuvant might be added to it to boost the immune system’s reaction to it.

How can I protect myself until a vaccine is available?

The CDC suggests some common-sense ways for people to protect themselves:
• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
• If you can’t find soap and water, use an alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
• Use a tissue when you cough or sneeze and then throw it away immediately.
• Use a face mask if you show symptoms of COVID-19 so you don’t infect others. (The masks are not recommended for healthy people who are just generally trying to protect themselves against infection.)",mainstream
517,"The mother of a Cheshire teenager who was left severely brain damaged by the MMR vaccine has won a compensation award from the government.

Robert Fletcher, 18, from Warrington, suffered a fit 10 days after he had the vaccination when he was 13 months old.

His mother Jackie received the £90,000 payout from a medical assessment panel last week.

The family successfully appealed after their application for compensation was originally turned down in 1997.

They had originally applied through the Government's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme.

Robert has frequent epileptic fits, is unable to talk, stand unaided or feed himself, but is not autistic.

Mrs Fletcher always believed that her son's epilepsy was triggered by the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

The ruling and compensation award was made by a jury made up of a judge and two doctors.

It said the ruling had no relevance to the question of a link between the vaccine and autism.

Dr Andrew Wakefield was the lead author of the controversial study, published in The Lancet in 1998, which suggested there may be a link between MMR and autism and bowel disease.

His comments and the subsequent media furore led to a sharp drop in the number of children vaccinated against these diseases.

The study has since been discredited and The Lancet has said it should not have run it.

Mrs Fletcher has campaigned for justice for her son for the past 16 years.

She said: ""I feel vindicated by it because over the years I've been labelled anti-vaccine and a scaremonger and all sorts of things, when all I've been trying to do is highlight what's happened to my son, to help safeguard other parents' children.

""What I'm hoping now is that other parents whose children have suffered a similar reaction to Robert can maybe go down the same route that we've gone down to achieve justice for their children.""

A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""This decision reflects the opinion of a tribunal on the specific facts of the case and they were clear that it should not be seen as a precedent for any other case.

""The safety of MMR has been endorsed through numerous studies in many countries. Thankfully, more parents are having their children vaccinated with MMR and consider it as safe as other childhood vaccines.""

He added: ""MMR vaccine has been used extensively and safely around the world for over 30 years. Over 500 million doses have been given in over 100 countries.

""The World Health Organisation recognises MMR as being a 'highly effective vaccine which has (such) an outstanding safety record'.

""Parents and carers should continue to get their children immunised when called to do so.""",mainstream
805,"British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca AZN, has received more than $1 billion in U.S. funding to accelerate the development of Oxford University’s coronavirus vaccine candidate.

The agreement would make 300 million doses of the vaccine available in the U.S., with the first doses delivered in October, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services said on Thursday. The agreement between AstraZeneca and the U.S. Biomedical Research and Development Authority also includes a Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. this summer with 30,000 volunteers.

The U.S. has also supported vaccine efforts by Moderna MRNA, , France’s Sanofi SAN, and Johnson & Johnson JNJ, , as part of the Trump administration’s “Operation Warp Speed” initiative.

AstraZeneca said it has now secured orders for 400 million doses and has the manufacturing capacity for 1 billion doses — the first of which could be delivered in September if the Oxford vaccine proves successful.

Read:Everything you need to know about the Oxford University vaccine

The project, being developed by clinical research teams at the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group in the U.K., is currently in the human-trial stage. The university’s best-case scenario sees an efficacy result from a Phase 3 study by the fall, while initial signs of whether it is successful are expected by July.

The FTSE 100 company struck a partnership with Oxford University at the end of April to develop, manufacture and distribute the university’s experimental vaccine — if it works.

The U.K. is set to be given first access to the potential vaccine, as the British government said 30 million doses could be made available as early as September, as part of an agreement for 100 million doses. U.K. business secretary Alok Sharma committed a further £84 million of funding to the project on Sunday — on top of the £47 million already invested — adding that the Oxford efforts were “progressing well.”

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot thanked the U.S. and U.K. governments for their support on Thursday, which he said would accelerate the development and production of the vaccine.

“We need to defeat the virus together or it will continue to inflict huge personal suffering and leave long-lasting economic and social scars in every country around the world. We will do everything in our power to make this vaccine quickly and widely available.”

The British drug maker also has a 7.7% stake in Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna, whose own experimental vaccine has been said to have had encouraging early results. Moderna’s stock has soared 275% so far this year, taking the value of AstraZeneca’s stake above $2 billion.",mainstream
534,"Just three months after China first notified the World Health Organization about a deadly new coronavirus, studies of numerous antiviral treatments and potential vaccines are already underway. Never has science advanced so much in such a short period of time to combat an epidemic.

Many of the proposals now under study come from research groups that have spent years working to combat similar coronaviruses, particularly SARS and MERS. All that accumulated knowledge has allowed scientists to advance at unprecedented speed.

We know, for example, that the genome of the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, is 79% like that of SARS. We know the “key” used by the virus to get into human lung cells is protein S and that the “lock” in the cell is the ACE2 receptor. We also know that the entry of the virus is facilitated by a protease, or an enzyme that breaks down proteins, from the cell itself, called TMPRSS211.

Other SARS-CoV-2 genes get to work once the virus is inside the lung cell: the genes for RNA polymerase (RdRp), an enzyme that replicates the virus genome, and for C3CLpro and PLpro proteases, which are involved in the processing of viral proteins. These genes are likewise very similar to those of SARS.

These details are important. Understanding the biology of SARS-CoV-2 – and how it resembles or differs from other deadly viruses – facilitates the design of antiviral drugs to treat the disease and vaccines to prevent it.

Antivirals are drugs that interfere with the replication of harmful viruses without also harming the host cells. They can work by blocking the entry of the virus into the host cell, or by inhibiting the replication of the virus.

Chloroquine has been used for years against malaria. This cheap and widely available drug is also a powerful antiviral, meaning it blocks a virus from entering human cells. Several research groups, including one at the University of Minnesota, are now studying whether it is effective in reducing the viral load in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

Some enveloped viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, enter the cell by endocytosis – a cellular process in which substances are brought into the cell – forming a small vesicle. Once inside, a drop in pH promotes the fusion of the virus envelope with the membrane of the vesicle that contains it, in order to be released into the cytoplasm.

Chloroquine prevents this drop in pH, inhibiting the fusion of the membranes and thus prevent the passage of the virus to the cell cytoplasm. Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, has already been found to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in cell culture.

Researchers are also testing Barcitinib, an anti-inflammatory drug approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, which may also inhibit endocytosis of the virus. Another drug they are testing is camostat mesylate, a drug approved in Japan for use in treating inflammation of the pancreas, which has been shown to block the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into lung cells.

One of the most promising antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2 is called remdesivir, which has been used successfully against SARS, MERS and Ebola. Remdesivir is nucleotide analogue, a major class of anti-cancer and antiviral drugs that prevents the virus from multiplying within the cell. At least 13 clinical trials are already underway in China and the United States to see if remdesivir may stop SARS-CoV-2.

Another wide-spectrum viral RNA polymerase inhibitor that has already started clinical trials is called favipiravir, already an approved flu treatment. The first results with 340 Chinese patients have been satisfactory, reducing the number of days coronavirus patients were sick.

Some scientists have suggested that a combination of the drugs ritonavir and lopinavir – compounds used to treat HIV – may also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteases, or enzymes that break down proteins. Lopinavir is a virus protease inhibitor that breaks down easily in the patient’s blood. Ritonavir is administered with lopinavir to protect it from breaking down.

A recently published article detailing the results of a study of 199 patients shows that the ritonavir/lopinavir treatment is not effective against coronavirus.

At least 27 other clinical trials with experimental combinations of different antiviral treatments – such as interferon alfa-2b, ribavirin, methylprednisolone and azvudine – are now underway.

The World Health Organization highlights at least 41 proposed vaccines for testing against coronavirus. Vaccines are a prevention strategy. If they are developed now, they can give people immunity from future outbreaks.

One of the most advanced efforts is happening in China with a recombinant adenovirus vector-based vaccine based on the SARS-CoV-2 S gene. When tested in monkeys, this vaccine candidate produced antibodies, which help fight the virus. A phase I clinical trial will soon begin in Wuhan with 108 healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years old, in which three different doses will be tested.

The goal of a phase I trial is to check the safety of the vaccine at different doses, evaluating any side effects. If a drug is proven to be safe, it may then be moved into a phase II trial, in which the drug is administered to people to see if it works.

Other proposals are being promoted by CEPI, an international association in which public, private, civil and philanthropic organizations collaborate to develop vaccines against future epidemics. It is currently funding eight coronavirus vaccine projects that include recombinant, protein, and nucleic acid vaccines (all are in the preclinical phase unless otherwise noted):

Recombinant measles virus vaccine (Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience and University of Pittsburg) - Adds a SARS-CoV-2 gene to a non-virulent measles virus to induce a protective response.

Recombinant influenza virus vaccine (University of Hong Kong) - Adds a SARS-CoV-2 gene to a non-virulent strain of the flu, which could be administered intranasally and work dually as a flu vaccine.

Recombinant vaccine using the Oxford chimpanzee adenovirus, ChAdOx1 (Jenner Institute, University of Oxford) - Models of this vaccine type have been tested against MERS, influenza, chikungunya and other pathogens such as malaria and tuberculosis, and can be manufactured in large scale in bird embryo cell lines.

Recombinant protein vaccine (Novavax) - This vaccine relies on nanoparticle technology, a proprietary technology that Novavax has already employed to manufacture several well-tolerated vaccines that stimulate a powerful and long-lasting non-specific immune response that prevents respiratory infections like adult flu, SARS and MERS.

Recombinant protein vaccine (University of Queensland) - This vaccine relies on the creation of chimeric molecules capable of maintaining the original three-dimensional structure of the viral antigen. They use the technique called “molecular clamp,” which allows vaccines to be produced using the virus genome in record time. It is in the preclinical phase.

Vaccine mRNA-1273 (Moderna) made up of a small fragment of messenger RNA with the instructions to synthesize part of the SARS-Co-V protein S. The idea is that once introduced into our cells, they would make this protein, which would then act as an antigen and stimulate the production of antibodies. It is already in the clinical phase and it has begun to be tested in healthy volunteers.

Messenger RNA vaccine (CureVac) - This is similar to the Moderna proposal, with recombinant messenger RNA molecules that are easily recognized by the cellular machinery and produce large amounts of antigen. They are packaged in lipid nanoparticles or other vectors.

DNA INO-4800 vaccine (Inovio Pharmaceuticals) - Inovio manufactures synthetic vaccines using DNA of the S gene that is present in the surface of the coronavirus. Clinical tests of a similar prototype vaccine against MERS, called the INO-4700 vaccine, found that the drug was well tolerated and produced a good immune response (high antibody levels and good T-cell response, maintained for at least 60 weeks after vaccination).

Finally, two Spanish researchers, Luis Enjuanes and Isabel Sola, have just received express funding from the Spanish government to develop a live attenuated coronavirus vaccine that would create an altered copy of the virus that is incapable of producing the disease but that serves to activate our defenses.

There is still no approved antiviral or specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. All of these antiviral and vaccine proposals are in the experimental phase. Some will not work, but the chances of finding one that will are high.

The WHO’s new international consortium, called Solidarity, seeks effective treatment for COVID-19. At the moment, Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand are participating, and it is expected that ever more nations will join in this great global clinical trial project.

399,"The University of Chicago (UChicago, U of C, or Chicago) is a private research university in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1890, the school is located on a 217-acre (88-hectare) campus in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood.[6]

The university is composed of the undergraduate college as well as various graduate programs and interdisciplinary committees organized into five academic research divisions. Beyond the arts and sciences, Chicago is well known for its professional schools, which include the Pritzker School of Medicine, the Booth School of Business, the Law School, the School of Social Service Administration, the Harris School of Public Policy, the Divinity School and the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies, as well as the recently launched Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. The university has additional campuses and centers in London, Paris, Beijing, Delhi, and Hong Kong, as well as in downtown Chicago.[7][8]

University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of many academic disciplines, including economics, law, literary criticism, mathematics, religion, sociology, and the behavioralism school of political science, establishing the Chicago schools in various fields.[9][10][11][12][13] Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory produced the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction in Chicago Pile-1 beneath the viewing stands of the university's Stagg Field.[14] Advances in chemistry led to the ""radiocarbon revolution"" in the carbon-14 dating of ancient life and objects.[15] The university research efforts include administration of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States.[16] The Barack Obama Presidential Center is expected to be housed at the university and will include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.[17]

The University of Chicago has produced many prominent alumni, faculty members and researchers. As of October 2019 , 100 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the university as students, faculty, or staff, giving it one of the highest concentrations of Nobel laureates in the world.[18] As of 2018, UChicago affiliates also include 54 Rhodes Scholars,[19] 26 Marshall Scholars,[20] 9 Fields Medalists,[21] 4 Turing Award winners, 52 MacArthur Fellows,[22] 25 Pulitzer Prize winners,[23] 20 National Humanities Medalists[24] and 16 billionaire graduates.[25]

The University of Chicago was incorporated as a coeducational[26] institution in 1890 by the American Baptist Education Society, using $400,000 donated to the ABES to match a $600,000 donation from Baptist oil magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller,[27] and including land donated by Marshall Field.[28] While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings. The Hyde Park campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like Silas B. Cobb who provided the funds for the campus' first building, Cobb Lecture Hall, and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000. Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson (trustee, treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons), Martin A. Ryerson (president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum, a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities.[29]

The Hyde Park campus continued the legacy of the original university of the same name, which had closed in the 1880s after its campus was foreclosed on.[30] What became known as the Old University of Chicago had been founded by a small group of Baptist educators in 1856 through a land endowment from Senator Stephen A. Douglas. After a fire, it closed in 1886.[31] Alumni from the Old University of Chicago are recognized as alumni of the present University of Chicago.[32] The university's depiction on its coat of arms of a phoenix rising from the ashes is a reference to the fire, foreclosure, and demolition of the Old University of Chicago campus.[33] As an homage to this pre-1890 legacy, a single stone from the rubble of the original Douglas Hall on 34th Place was brought to the current Hyde Park location and set into the wall of the Classics Building. These connections have led the Dean of the College and University of Chicago and Professor of History John Boyer to conclude that the University of Chicago has, ""a plausible genealogy as a pre–Civil War institution"".[34]

William Rainey Harper became the university's president on July 1, 1891 and the Hyde Park campus opened for classes on October 1, 1892.[30] Harper worked on building up the faculty and in two years he had a faculty of 120, including eight former university or college presidents.[35] Harper was an accomplished scholar (Semiticist) and a member of the Baptist clergy who believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus.[36] To fulfill this commitment, he brought the Old University of Chicago's Seminary to Hyde Park. This became the Divinity School in 1891, the first professional school at the University of Chicago.[37]

Harper recruited acclaimed Yale baseball and football player Amos Alonzo Stagg from the Young Men's Christian Association training school at Springfield to coach the school's football program. Stagg was given a position on the faculty, the first such athletic position in the United States. While coaching at the University, Stagg invented the numbered football jersey, the huddle, and the lighted playing field. Stagg is the namesake of the university's Stagg Field.[38]

The business school was founded in 1898,[39] and the law school was founded in 1902.[40] Harper died in 1906[41] and was replaced by a succession of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929.[42] During this period, the Oriental Institute was founded to support and interpret archeological work in what was then called the Near East.[43]

In the 1890s, the university, fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except for travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.[44]

In 1929, the university's fifth president, 30-year-old legal philosophy scholar Robert Maynard Hutchins, took office. The university underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins reformed the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core,[45] organized the university's graduate work into four divisions,[46] and eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics.[46] During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the University of Chicago Medical Center) finished construction and enrolled their first medical students.[47] Also, the philosophy oriented Committee on Social Thought, an institution distinctive of the university, was created.

Money that had been raised during the 1920s and financial backing from the Rockefeller Foundation helped the school to survive through the Great Depression.[46] Nonetheless, in 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University into a single university.[48] During World War II, the university's Metallurgical Laboratory made ground-breaking contributions to the Manhattan Project.[49] The university was the site of the first isolation of plutonium and of the creation of the first artificial, self-sustained nuclear reaction by Enrico Fermi in 1942.[49][50]

It has been noted that the university did not provide standard oversight regarding Bruno Bettelheim and his tenure as director of the Orthogenic School for Disturbed Children from 1944 to 1973.[51][52][53]

In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan.[54] During this period the university, like Shimer College and 10 others, adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college; also, students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year, having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses.

The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962 when then-freshman Bernie Sanders helped lead a 15-day sit-in at the college's administration building in a protest over the university's off-campus rental policies. After continued turmoil, a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the Kalven Report. The report, a two-page statement of the university's policy in ""social and political action,"" declared that ""To perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures.""[55] The report has since been used to justify decisions such as the university's refusal to divest from South Africa in the 1980s and Darfur in the late 2000s.[56]

In 1969, more than 400 students, angry about the dismissal of a popular professor, Marlene Dixon, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended,[57] the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.[58]

In 1978, Hanna Holborn Gray, then the provost and acting president of Yale University, became President of the University of Chicago, a position she held for 15 years.[59]

In 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein announced plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum, reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15. When The New York Times, The Economist, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.[60]

From the mid-2000s, the university began a number of multimillion-dollar expansion projects. In 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the Milton Friedman Institute, which attracted both support and controversy from faculty members and students.[61][62][63][64][65] The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary. During the same year, investor David G. Booth donated $300 million to the university's Booth School of Business, which is the largest gift in the university's history and the largest gift ever to any business school.[66] In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway.[67] Since 2011, major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, and further additions to the medical campus of the University of Chicago Medical Center.[68] In 2014 the University launched the public phase of a $4.5 billion fundraising campaign.[69] In September 2015, the University received $100 million from The Pearson Family Foundation to establish The Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and The Pearson Global Forum at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies.[70]

On May 1, 2014, the University of Chicago was named one of fifty-five higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights ""for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints"" by the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.[71]

In 2019, the university created its first school in three decades, the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering.[72][73]

The main campus of the University of Chicago consists of 217 acres (87.8 ha) in the Chicago neighborhoods of Hyde Park and Woodlawn, approximately eight miles (12 km) south of downtown Chicago. The northern and southern portions of campus are separated by the Midway Plaisance, a large, linear park created for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the university as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.[74]

The first buildings of the campus, which make up what is now known as the Main Quadrangles, were part of a master plan conceived by two University of Chicago trustees and plotted by Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb.[76] The Main Quadrangles consist of six quadrangles, each surrounded by buildings, bordering one larger quadrangle.[77] The buildings of the Main Quadrangles were designed by Cobb, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, Holabird & Roche, and other architectural firms in a mixture of the Victorian Gothic and Collegiate Gothic styles, patterned on the colleges of the University of Oxford.[76] (Mitchell Tower, for example, is modeled after Oxford's Magdalen Tower,[78] and the university Commons, Hutchinson Hall, replicates Christ Church Hall.[79]) In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the University of Chicago Quadrangles were selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places[80] by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois).

After the 1940s, the campus's Gothic style began to give way to modern styles.[76] In 1955, Eero Saarinen was contracted to develop a second master plan, which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway, including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (a complex designed by Saarinen);[76] a series of arts buildings;[76] a building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the university's School of Social Service Administration,[76] a building which is to become the home of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies by Edward Durrell Stone, and the Regenstein Library, the largest building on campus, a brutalist structure designed by Walter Netsch of the Chicago firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.[81] Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004,[82] produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center (2003),[82] the Max Palevsky Residential Commons (2001),[76] South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital,[83] and other construction, expansions, and restorations.[84] In 2011, the university completed the glass dome-shaped Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository.

The site of Chicago Pile-1 is a National Historic Landmark and is marked by the Henry Moore sculpture Nuclear Energy.[85] Robie House, a Frank Lloyd Wright building acquired by the university in 1963, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site [86] as well as a National Historic Landmark,[87] as is room 405 of the George Herbert Jones Laboratory, where Glenn T. Seaborg and his team were the first to isolate plutonium.[88] Hitchcock Hall, an undergraduate dormitory, is on the National Register of Historic Places.[89]

The university also maintains facilities apart from its main campus. The university's Booth School of Business maintains campuses in Hong Kong, London, and the downtown Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago. The Center in Paris, a campus located on the left bank of the Seine in Paris, hosts various undergraduate and graduate study programs.[92] In fall 2010, the university opened a center in Beijing, near Renmin University's campus in Haidian District. The most recent additions are a center in New Delhi, India, which opened in 2014, and a center in Hong Kong which opened in 2015.

The university is governed by a board of trustees. The Board of Trustees oversees the long-term development and plans of the university and manages fundraising efforts, and is composed of 55 members including the university President.[93] Directly beneath the President are the Provost, fourteen Vice Presidents (including the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer, and Vice President for Campus Life and Student Services), the Directors of Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab, the Secretary of the university, and the Student Ombudsperson.[94] As of May 2016 , the Chairman of the Board of Trustees is Joseph Neubauer,[95] and the President of the university is Robert Zimmer. In December 2013 it was announced that the Director of Argonne National Laboratory, Eric Isaacs, would become Provost. Isaacs was replaced as Provost in March 2016 by Daniel Diermeier.[96]

The university's endowment was the 12th largest among American educational institutions and state university systems in 2013[97] and as of 2018 was valued at $8.2 billion.[98] Part of President Zimmer's financial plan for the university has been an increase in accumulation of debt to finance large building projects.[99] This has drawn both support and criticism from many in the university community.

The academic bodies of the University of Chicago consist of the College, five divisions of graduate research, six professional schools, and the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies. The university also contains a library system, the University of Chicago Press, and the University of Chicago Medical Center, and oversees several laboratories, including Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), Argonne National Laboratory, and the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission.[100]

The university runs on a quarter system in which the academic year is divided into four terms: Summer (June–August), Autumn (September–December), Winter (January–March), and Spring (April–June).[101] Full-time undergraduate students take three to four courses every quarter[102] for approximately eleven weeks before their quarterly academic breaks. The school year typically begins in late September and ends in mid-June.[101]

The University of Chicago has an extensive record of producing successful business leaders and billionaires.[25][112][113][114] ARWU has consistently placed the University of Chicago among the top 10 universities in the world,[115] and the 2020 QS World University Rankings placed the university in 10th place worldwide.[116] The university's law and business schools rank among the top five professional schools in the United States.[117] The business school is currently ranked first in the US by US News & World Report[118] and first in the world by The Economist,[119] while the law school is ranked fourth by US News & World Report[120] and first by Above the Law.[121]

Chicago has also been consistently recognized to be one of the top 15 university brands in the world,[122] retaining the number three spot in the 2019 U.S. News Best Colleges Rankings.[123] In a corporate study carried out by The New York Times, the university's graduates were shown to be among the most valued in the world.[124]

The College of the University of Chicago grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 51 academic majors[125] and 33 minors.[126] The college's academics are divided into five divisions: the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division, the Physical Sciences Collegiate Division, the Social Sciences Collegiate Division, the Humanities Collegiate Division, and the New Collegiate Division.[127] The first four are sections within their corresponding graduate divisions, while the New Collegiate Division administers interdisciplinary majors and studies which do not fit in one of the other four divisions.[128]

Undergraduate students are required to take a distribution of courses to satisfy the university's general education requirements, commonly known as the Common Core. In 2012–2013, the Core classes at Chicago were limited to 17 courses, and are generally led by a full-time professor (as opposed to a teaching assistant).[129] As of the 2013–2014 school year, 15 courses and demonstrated proficiency in a foreign language are required under the Core.[130] Undergraduate courses at the University of Chicago are known for their demanding standards, heavy workload and academic difficulty; according to Uni in the USA, ""Among the academic cream of American universities – Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and the University of Chicago – it is UChicago that can most convincingly claim to provide the most rigorous, intense learning experience.""[131]

The university graduate schools and committees are divided into five divisions: Biological Sciences, Humanities, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, and the Institute for Molecular Engineering.[132] In the autumn quarter of 2015, the university enrolled 3,588 graduate students: 438 in the Biological Sciences Division, 801 in the Humanities Division, 1,102 in the Physical Sciences Division, 1,165 in the Social Sciences Division, and 52 in the Institute for Molecular Engineering.[133]

The university is home to several committees for interdisciplinary scholarship, including the John U. Nef Committee on Social Thought.

The university contains seven professional schools: the Pritzker School of Medicine, the Booth School of Business, the University of Chicago Law School, the University of Chicago Divinity School, the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy Studies, and the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration. The Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies offers non-degree courses and certificates as well as degree programs.[134]

The Law School is accredited by the American Bar Association, the Divinity School is accredited by the Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada, Pritzker is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education.[100]

The university runs a number of academic institutions and programs apart from its undergraduate and postgraduate schools. It operates the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (a private day school for K-12 students and day care),[135] and a public charter school with four campuses on the South Side of Chicago administered by the university's Urban Education Institute.[136] In addition, the Hyde Park Day School, a school for students with learning disabilities,[137] and the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School, a residential treatment program for those with behavioral and emotional problems,[138] maintains a location on the University of Chicago campus. Since 1983, the University of Chicago has maintained the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project, a mathematics program used in urban primary and secondary schools.[139] The university runs a program called the Council on Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences, which administers interdisciplinary workshops to provide a forum for graduate students, faculty, and visiting scholars to present scholarly work in progress.[140] The university also operates the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States.[141]

The University of Chicago Library system encompasses six libraries that contain a total of 11 million volumes, the 9th most among library systems in the United States.[142] The university's main library is the Regenstein Library, which contains one of the largest collections of print volumes in the United States. The Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, built in 2011, houses a large study space and an automated book storage and retrieval system. The John Crerar Library contains more than 1.4 million volumes in the biological, medical and physical sciences and collections in general science and the philosophy and history of science, medicine, and technology.[143] The university also operates a number of special libraries, including the D'Angelo Law Library, the Social Service Administration Library, and the Eckhart Library for mathematics and computer science.[144][145] Harper Memorial Library is now a reading and study room.

In fiscal year 2015, the University of Chicago spent $421.1 million on research.[146] It is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as an institution with ""highest research activity""[147] and is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was a member of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation from 1946 through June 29, 2016, when the group's name was changed to the Big Ten Academic Alliance. The University of Chicago is not a member of the rebranded consortium, but will continue to be a collaborator.[148][149]

The university operates more than 140 research centers and institutes on campus.[150] Among these are the Oriental Institute—a museum and research center for Near Eastern studies owned and operated by the university—and a number of National Resource Centers, including the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. Chicago also operates or is affiliated with several research institutions apart from the university proper. The university manages Argonne National Laboratory, part of the United States Department of Energy's national laboratory system, and co-manages Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) , a nearby particle physics laboratory, as well as a stake in the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico. Faculty and students at the adjacent Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago collaborate with the university.[151] In 2013, the university formed an affiliation with the formerly independent Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass.[152] Although formally unrelated, the National Opinion Research Center is located on Chicago's campus.

The University of Chicago has been the site of some important experiments and academic movements. In economics, the university has played an important role in shaping ideas about the free market[153] and is the namesake of the Chicago school of economics, the school of economic thought supported by Milton Friedman and other economists. The university's sociology department was the first independent sociology department in the United States and gave birth to the Chicago school of sociology.[154] In physics, the university was the site of the Chicago Pile-1 (the first controlled, self-sustaining man-made nuclear chain reaction, part of the Manhattan Project), of Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment that calculated the charge of the electron,[155] and of the development of radiocarbon dating by Willard F. Libby in 1947. The chemical experiment that tested how life originated on early Earth, the Miller–Urey experiment, was conducted at the university. REM sleep was discovered at the university in 1953 by Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinsky.[156]

The University of Chicago (Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics) operated the Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin from 1897 until 2018,[157] where the largest operating refracting telescope in the world and other telescopes are located.

The UChicago Arts program joins academic departments and programs in the Division of the Humanities and the college, as well as professional organizations including the Court Theatre, the Oriental Institute, the Smart Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and cinema and media studies since 2000, a master of fine arts in visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, cinema and media studies (1996) and theater and performance studies (2002). The college's general education core includes a ""dramatic, musical, and visual arts"" requirement, inviting students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes.[158] UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is entirely glass. The brick is a facade designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.

In Fall 2018, the university enrolled 6,595 undergraduate students, 9,899 graduate students, and 616 non-degree students.[160] The college class of 2022 is composed of 51% male students and 49% female students. 23% of the class identify as Asian, 15% as Hispanic, and 9% as Black. 15% of the class is international.[161]

Admissions to the University of Chicago is highly selective. The middle 50% band of SAT scores for the undergraduate class of 2022 was 1490–1560 (98th-99th percentiles),[161] the average MCAT score for students entering the Pritzker School of Medicine class of 2022 was 518 (96th percentile),[162] the median GMAT score for students entering the full-time Booth MBA program class of 2021 was 730 (96th percentile),[163] and the median LSAT score for entering students the Law School class of 2021 was 171 (98th percentile).[164] For the class of 2024, the College of the University of Chicago had an acceptance rate of 6.2%.[165]

In 2018, the University of Chicago attracted national headlines by becoming the first major research university to no longer require SAT/ACT scores from college applicants.[166]

The University of Chicago hosts 19 varsity sports teams: 10 men's teams and 9 women's teams,[167] all called the Maroons, with 502 students participating in the 2012–2013 school year.[167]

The Maroons compete in the NCAA's Division III as members of the University Athletic Association (UAA). The university was a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and participated in the NCAA Division I men's basketball and football and was a regular participant in the men's basketball tournament. In 1935, the University of Chicago reached the Sweet Sixteen.[167] In 1935, Chicago Maroons football player Jay Berwanger became the first winner of the Heisman Trophy. However, the university chose to withdraw from the Big Ten Conference in 1946 after University President Robert Maynard Hutchins de-emphasized varsity athletics in 1939 and dropped football.[168] In 1969, Chicago reinstated football as a Division III team, resuming playing its home games at the new Stagg Field. UChicago is also the home of the ultimate frisbee team Chicago Junk.[169]

Students at the University of Chicago operate more than 400 clubs and organizations known as Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs).[170][171] These include cultural and religious groups, academic clubs and teams, and common-interest organizations.[171] Notable extracurricular groups include the University of Chicago College Bowl Team, which has won 118 tournaments and 15 national championships, leading both categories internationally. The university's competitive Model United Nations team was the top-ranked team in North America in 2013–14, 2014–2015, 2015–2016, and again for the 2017–2018 season. The University's Model UN team is also the first to be in the top 5 for almost a decade, according to Best Delegate. Among notable student organizations are the nation's longest continuously running student film society Doc Films, the organizing committee for the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, the weekly student newspaper The Chicago Maroon, the satirical Chicago Shady Dealer,[172] the nation's second-oldest continuously running student improvisational theater troupe Off-Off Campus, and the investment club The Blue Chips.

All Recognized Student Organizations, from the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt to Model UN, in addition to academic teams, sports clubs, arts groups, and more are funded by The University of Chicago Student Government. Student Government consists of graduate and undergraduate students elected to represent members from their respective academic units. It is led by an Executive Committee, chaired by a President with the assistance of two Vice Presidents, one for Administration and the other for Student Life, elected together as a slate by the student body each spring. Its annual budget is greater than $2 million.[173]

There are 16 Fraternities at the university: Alpha Delta Phi (Chicago Chapter), Alpha Epsilon Pi (Lambda Chapter), Alpha Phi Alpha (Theta Chapter), Delta Epsilon Psi (Alpha Kappa), Delta Kappa Epsilon (Delta Delta), Delta Tau Delta (Gamma Alpha), Delta Upsilon(Chicago Chapter), Kappa Alpha Psi (Iota Chapter), Lambda Phi Epsilon (Psi Chapter), Phi Delta Theta (Beta Chapter), Phi Gamma Delta (Chi Upsilon Chapter), Phi Iota Alpha (Chicago Colony Chapter), Psi Upsilon (Omega Chapter), Sigma Chi (Omicron Omicron Chapter), Sigma Phi Epsilon (Omicron Omicron Chapter) and Zeta Psi (Omega Alpha Chapter).

Four of the sororities are members of the National Panhellenic Conference[176] There is no Interfraternity Council on campus. As of 2017 , approximately 20 to 25 percent of students are members of fraternities or sororities.[176] This is an increase from the numbers published in the year 2007 by the student activities office stating that one in ten undergraduates participated in Greek life.[174]

On-campus undergraduate students at the University of Chicago participate in a house system in which each student is assigned to one of the university's 7 residence hall buildings and to a smaller community within their residence hall called a ""House"". There are 39 houses, with an average of 70 students in each House.[177] Traditionally only first years were required to live in housing, starting with the Class of 2023, students are required to live in housing for the first 2 years of enrollment.[178] About 60% of undergraduate students live on campus.[178]

For graduate students, the university owns and operates 28 apartment buildings near campus.[179]

Every May since 1987, the University of Chicago has held the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, in which large teams of students compete to obtain notoriously esoteric items from a list.[180] Since 1963, the Festival of the Arts (FOTA) takes over campus for 7–10 days of exhibitions and interactive artistic endeavors.[181] Every January, the university holds a week-long winter festival, Kuviasungnerk/Kangeiko, which includes early morning exercise routines and fitness workshops. The university also annually holds a summer carnival and concert called Summer Breeze that hosts outside musicians and is home to Doc Films, a student film society founded in 1932 that screens films nightly at the university. Since 1946, the university has organized the Latke-Hamantash Debate, which involves humorous discussions about the relative merits and meanings of latkes and hamantashen.

504,"How many of you saw Florida Congressman Bill Posey grill Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the company’s vaccine censorship directives, during a House Financial Services hearing just two weeks ago?

In case you missed it, Posey said: “I support vaccinations of children and adults, but I also support open and frank communication about the risks of vaccination…“.

Posey told Zuckerberg. “You testified that you believe in giving people a voice. Is Facebook able to assure us it will support users’ fair and open discussions, and communications about the risks as well as the benefits of vaccinations?“

Zuckerberg said anti-vaccination users on Facebook have the same rights to expression as others, and their views aren’t censored.

Not censored? Okay. But, Zuckerberg also went on to say that anti-vaccination voices on Facebook aren’t publicized, either.

“If someone wants to post anti-vaccination content or they want to join a group where people are discussing that, we don’t stop them from doing that,” said Zuckerberg. “But […] we don’t go out of our way to make sure our group recommendation systems show people or encourage people to join those groups. We discourage that.“

In other words, for Zuckerberg and Facebook, some views are more equal than others.",conspiracy
1317,"Some stories need to be retold, especially in light of the documentary Vaxxed: From Cover Up to Catastrophe, now showing in theaters as the controversy rages concerning the MMR vaccine’s link to autism. Thom Hartman interviewed Vaxxed director Andrew Wakefield and producer Del Bigtree, who shared some undeniable — and chilling — facts.

In 2012, a study was done at the University of Pittsburg using infant monkeys as guinea pigs. These animals were given standard childhood doses of vaccines. Guess what happened? The monkeys developed autistic symptoms, as reported by Natural News.

“Presented at the International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR) in London, England, the findings revealed that young macaque monkeys given the typical CDC-recommended vaccination schedule from the 1990s, and in appropriate doses for the monkeys’ sizes and ages, tended to develop autism symptoms. Their unvaccinated counterparts, on the other hand, developed no such symptoms, which points to a strong connection between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders.

“Included in the mix were several vaccines containing the toxic additive Thimerosal, a mercury-based compound that has been phased out of some vaccines, but is still present in batch-size influenza vaccines and a few others. Also administered was the controversial measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has been linked time and time again to causing autism and various other serious, and often irreversible, health problems in children.”

Was this study on primates just disregarded? Why don’t vaccines need to be proven safe before they are rushed to market? Why are thousands, if not millions, of families around the globe suffering from the tragic effects of untested filled syringes with mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, bovine extract, et al? With profit being the name of the game, the destruction of the next generation will continue. What will you do to stop it?",conspiracy
108,"The Official Military Personnel Files (OMPF), held at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), are administrative records containing information about the subject's military service history. Many OMPFs contain both personnel and former active duty health records, but the service branches discontinued retiring the health record portion to the NPRC in the 1990s.

In the past, all of the military services retired the individual health record, along with the personnel record, to the NPRC upon a service member's separation from service. The Army and the Air Force retired its health records with the Official Military Personnel File, while the Department of the Navy (including the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) retired these files separately to the NPRC until the 1980s.

Health records cover the outpatient, dental and mental health treatment that former members received while in military service. Health records include induction and separation physical examinations, as well as routine medical care (doctor/dental visits, lab tests, etc.) when the patient was not admitted to a hospital.

In comparison, clinical (hospital inpatient) records were generated when active duty members were actually hospitalized while in the service. Typically, these records are NOT filed with the health records but are generally retired to the NPRC by the facility which created them (see clinical records for more information). Medical records from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are also not included.

In the 1990s, the military services discontinued the practice of filing health records with the personnel record portion at the NPRC. In 1992, the Army began retiring most of its former members' health records to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Over the next six years, the other services followed suit. In 2014, the military services dicontinued the practice of retiring the records to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In order to determine where a medical record is located, please see the chart below:

Veterans who plan to file a claim for medical benefits with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) do not need to request a copy of their military health record from the NPRC. After a claim is filed, the VA will obtain the original health record from the NPRC. In addition, many health records were lent to the Department of Veterans Affairs prior to the 1973 Fire.

Veterans who filed a medical claim should contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in order to determine if their record is already on file. The VA Toll Free # is: 1-800-827-1000 - it will connect the caller to the nearest VA office.",mainstream
1013,"“These mutations are completely benign and useful as a puzzle piece to uncover how the virus is spreading,” says Nextstrain co-founder Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle.

This genetics-first approach to tracking the coronavirus has emerged as a bright spot among the barrage of devastating pandemic headlines. Similar science was instrumental in decoding previous epidemics, such as Zika and Ebola. But experts say the declining cost and increased speed and efficiency of genetic sequencing tools has made it possible for a small army of researchers around the world to document the coronavirus’s destructive path even faster. Those insights can help officials choose whether to shift from containment to mitigation strategies, especially in places where testing has lagged.

“If we go back to the Ebola virus five years ago, it was a year-long process from samples being collected to genomes being sequenced and shared publicly,” Bedford says. “Now the turnaround is much faster—from two days to a week—and that real-time ability to use these techniques in a way that impacts the outbreak is new.”

Bedford’s lab has been using genetics to track the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, since the first U.S. cases started to multiply in Washington State in February and March. Back then, public health officials focused on tracking patients’ travel histories and connecting the dots back to potentially infected people they’d met along the way.

Meanwhile, Bedford and his team turned to unlocking the virus’s genetic code by analysing nasal samples collected from about two dozen patients. Their discovery was illuminating: By tracing how and where the virus had changed over time, Bedford showed that SARS-CoV-2 had been quietly incubating within the community for weeks since the first documented case in Seattle on January 21. The patient was a 35-year-old who had recently visited the outbreak’s original epicentre in Wuhan, China.

In other words, Bedford had scientific proof that people could unknowingly be spreading the coronavirus if they had a mild case and didn’t seek care, or if they had been missed by traditional surveillance because they weren’t tested. That revelation has fuelled the frantic lockdowns, closures, and social distancing recommendations around the world in an attempt to slow the spread.

“One thing that’s become clear is that genomics data gives you a much richer story about how the outbreak is unfolding,” Bedford says.

Nextstrain’s visualisation tools have also helped engage a public that’s hungry to learn about the science of the coronavirus, says Kristian Andersen, a computational biologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, whose lab has contributed more than a thousand genomes, including West Nile and Zika viruses, to the project.",mainstream
674,"The worst Ebola outbreak since 2014, when the deadly virus killed more than 11,000 people in western Africa, is erupting in the Democratic Republic of Congo. By mid-May 2018, the outbreak proved deadly for 27 people and affected dozens more as the virus made its way from a sparsely populated rural region to Mbandaka, a city of more than 1 million. And, on May 24, two Ebola-infected patients fled a Mbandaka treatment facility, fueling fears the virus — it kills about half the people it infects — could continue to spread.

As of May 29, 2018, the World Health Organization still refrained from calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but it did begin transporting an experimental Ebola vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV to the region, in an attempt to corral the spread of the virus. Although this Ebola vaccine is still under testing before it gains final approval, it already has been used during an earlier outbreak. In the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, the vaccine was administered and proved effective in slowing the virus' spread.

To create the vaccine, researchers at the Canadian Public Health Agency and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute replaced a gene in a virus that causes vesicular stomatitis with a gene from Ebola. Vesicular stomatitis is a virus in the same disease family that includes rabies, and in animals, causes excessive saliva, mouth sores and lameness. Unless a secondary infection sets in, most animals recover on their own in about two weeks.

More than 7,500 doses of the Ebola vaccine are expected to be given to people showing symptoms in the affected Congo regions — as long as the refrigeration chain for the vaccines remains unbroken. To add to the level of difficulty in combating the spread of Ebola, the vaccine requires continual cool temperatures to remain active. This means transporting it in containers cooled by liquid nitrogen over rough terrain in hot weather. It's yet another obstacle in this go-round of the virus, one that is especially troubling because it has moved to a highly populated area. Previously, there have been several Ebola outbreaks in the Congo that were contained because they occurred in remote areas.",mainstream
100,"Could the flu vaccine combat the ? That's the question President Donald Trump asked during a White house roundtable discussion between his coronavirus task force and pharmaceutical company executives on Monday (March 2).

His question was answered with a direct ""no"" from an executive. The is designed to prevent infections with viruses, which are very different than coronaviruses. But the answer is slightly more complicated than that: The flu vaccine won't prevent you from getting a coronavirus, but it can help officials better respond to the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.

""I do think immunizing people against influenza has a very important indirect effect,"" said Dr. Albert Ko, a professor and department chair at the Yale School of Public Health.

First, health care workers are already burdened by flu cases so getting a flu shot, reduces the number of flu patients, thereby helping to ""relieve pressures"" in hospitals also treating patients with COVID-19, he said.

But there's another reason a flu shot could improve the country's response to the new outbreak: the U.S. is lagging behind other countries in testing for COVID-19. And that's unlikely to improve in the near term. On Thursday (March 5), Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the coronavirus, announced that the U.S. does not have enough test kits to meet demand.

How does that relate to the flu? If people get their flu shots, fewer people come down with the flu and come into clinics with nonspecific symptoms such as fever and cough, which overlap with .

Having fewer flu patients will make it easier to find the patients with COVID-19, he said.

Higher vaccination rates would ""make us much more efficient in detecting coronavirus,"" cases, Ko told Live Science. Finding COVID-19 cases is still akin to picking a ""needle out of a haystack,"" but reducing flu cases can ""decrease the haystack,"" he added.

As SARS-CoV-2 is spreading in communities on both coasts of the U.S., distinguishing between flu and COVID-19 will become more difficult.

On the bright side, it is ""incredibly rare,"" to catch both the flu and COVID-19 at once, said Dr. Eric Cioe Peña, director of Global Health, Northwell Health in New York and an emergency room physician. ""Usually if they have one, they don't have the other.""

Flu season is naturally dying down as spring approaches, but for those who haven't yet done so, ""we still recommend getting a flu shot,"" he added.

People with the flu are still coming into the hospital and there's always a chance there could be a second spike of the flu, Peña told Live Science.

That being said, flu cases in New York City have been down 25% each week for the past two weeks, he said. It's a positive step ""that we aren't seeing as many flu patients in the ER, so we have more room for severe coronavirus patients,"" Peña said.

At Northwell Health, patients aren't being tested for COVID-19 unless they meet criteria for admission to the hospital. ""That’s the only time that we're really testing because of the limited supply of tests,"" he added.

476,"During decades, mathematical models have been used to predict the behavior of physical and biologic systems, and to define strategies aiming the minimization of the effects regarding different types of diseases. In the present days, the development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to the quantity of infected people worldwide. In this work, the aim is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. For this purpose, an inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the compartmental SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. To solve such inverse problem, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed. After this step, two optimal control problems (mono- and multi-objective) to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment, i.e., a multi-objective optimal control problem. The solution of each optimal control problems is obtained using DE and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. The results regarding the proposed multi-objective optimal control problem provides a set of evidences from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be chosen, according to a given criterion.",mainstream
584,"(CNN) Abie Rohrig had just turned 18 when he told his mom he would be donating a kidney to save a stranger's life. Her answer: No you're not. He did it anyway -- the organ went to a man about his age -- and his mom was so inspired she went and donated a kidney herself.

So Rohrig expected her to understand when he told her that, for the benefit of humanity, he may volunteer to become infected with Covid-19

It turns out ""she's more worried than she was about the kidney thing,"" said Rohrig, now a 20-year-old college student who lives with his parents in a New York City apartment.

""She was like, 'What? What? I don't know,'"" he said. ""She's skeptical.""

Rohrig is one of more than 16,000 people -- most of them young adults -- who have signaled their support for a controversial method of speeding up the development of a vaccine by intentionally infecting dozens of volunteers. The signees of the online registry -- a new website called 1 Day Sooner -- have all checked a box next to the statement: ""I am interested in being exposed to the coronavirus to speed up vaccine development.""

The practice is called a human-challenge study -- or controlled human infection study -- and it can truncate a conventional vaccine study by several months. The reason: Rather than waiting for months to assess what percentage thousands of vaccine-trial volunteers get infected with the disease in question while leading their day-to-day lives, a challenge trial is much simpler, in that it exposes about 100 volunteers directly to the pathogen -- via syringe, cocktail, mosquito bite or nasal spray after an experimental vaccine or placebo is administered. (If the Covid-19 study comes to fruition, experts say it would likely be administered by nose drop.)

But if it's high reward, it's also high risk: Although Covid-19 is a much more deadly disease for the elderly and the compromised than healthy young adults, it is an unpredictable pathogen that has put star athletes in the hospital. What's more, should something go wrong, treatment options are limited.

However, with the disease still raging after having killed more than 82,000 Americans and 291,000 people worldwide since it first appeared in China late last year, some say a riskier-than-normal study is justified.

Co-authored by Nir Eyal of Rutgers, Marc Lipsitch of Harvard, and Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the piece concluded that while a human challenge study would not be without risks, ""every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally.""

""It's an idea that is controversial when people hear about it for the first time,"" Eyal, a bioethicist, told CNN. ""However, we show that if you select people in the right way and conduct the trial in the right way, it's surprisingly low risk and certainly within the bounds of what we already approve.""

Such a study would ultimately need the blessing of the US Food and Drug Administration.

But the researchers' call for a challenge study has since been propelled by the popular support of those who have indicated on 1 Day Sooner -- which is incorporating as a nonprofit organization -- that they'd be willing guinea pigs. (This is just an informal expression of interest, not a binding contract.)

The site, which was inspired by the scholarly article, launched in mid-April and is premised on the claim that shaving even one day from the long-distance race for a Covid-19 vaccine could save up to 7,120 lives.

What a human challenge study for coronavirus could look like

At some point, should a group of researchers decide to seriously explore the matter, the site would ask prospective volunteers to fill out pre-qualification questionnaires that would divulge more of their medical history, region of residence and other information that would help determine eligibility, said 1 Day Sooner's co-founder Josh Morrison.

The researchers would then screen those forms for the most eligible applicants and would eventually seek approval from a research or medical center to host the study, he said.

Morrison is a former corporate lawyer who gave up life in the fast lane to start a nonprofit organization called Waitlist Zero, which matches prospective kidney donors with recipients. Because business is at a near-standstill in the kidney-transplant world, Morrison found himself with a lot of spare time.

""I was like sitting at home in my apartment in New York City, just kind of depressed,"" he said.

Morrison came across the Journal article while noodling around on the internet.

""And I thought, 'Well, would I want to do this?'"" he said. ""I'm pretty young, 34, and in good health. And so I thought, 'Yeah, I think I would.'""

An FDA spokesperson told CNN that the agency would work with those who are interested in conducting human challenge trials to help them evaluate ethical and other issues.

""A formal determination about any specific human challenge trial proposal would be made by the FDA in the context of all the information that is available at that time,"" Michael Felberbaum wrote in an email.

Conventional vaccine trials typically consist of three phases -- the first, in which fewer than 100 participants are dosed to determine the safety; the second, in which the number of participants ramps up into the hundreds; and the third, in which the study is broadened to include thousands of people.

Typically, in that third phase, the participants return to their daily lives, and researchers -- over a period of months -- compare rates of infection between the placebo and test groups.

A human-challenge trial can replace a third phase, the Journal article says, short-circuiting the timeline by several months because researchers don't have to wait for participants to get infected the organic way -- by interacting with people at work, at school, in houses of worship or in homes. Instead, they expose the volunteers to the pathogen right then and there, in the lab.

A challenge trial can also serve as a bridge to a Phase 3 study, helping researchers determine which vaccine candidates are most promising; or it can pave the way for provisional licensure in emergency situations.

For a Covid-19 trial of the sort that 1 Day Sooner is advocating, the setup would likely entail first injecting an experimental vaccine into the arms of about 50 volunteers and a placebo into 50 others, challenge-trial experts told CNN. Two to four weeks later, all 100 would be exposed to the virus -- perhaps via nose-drop.

Human-challenge studies aren't new. They have played a key role in the development of several vaccines, including ones for malaria, flu and dengue.

Without human-challenge studies, a new vaccine for typhoid couldn't have been brought to Zimbabwe on a provisional basis last year, human-challenge experts told CNN.

The ""FDA approved a cholera vaccine simply on the basis of a human challenge,"" said Dr. Robert Read, an infectious-disease expert in the UK.

The difference is that those diseases came with fewer unknowns than Covid-19, and clinicians running the trials were able to offer medical treatments -- such as antibiotics or antivirals -- to infected patients exhibiting symptoms.

And although the idea of conducting a human-challenge trial for Covid-19 is catching on in the science community, some experts have raised serious concerns about safety.

Read, head of clinical and experimental sciences at University of Southampton, points out that Covid-19 remains a mysterious pathogen, and researchers can't give volunteers an accurate sense of the risk associated with getting intentionally infected.

""You do have to be able to describe what you know of what could happen to them if they undertake a controlled infection, with complete clarity and honesty,"" said Read, who has himself conducted challenge trials -- he recently infected dozens of volunteers with whooping cough in search of a more effective vaccine. ""And I think lots of volunteers, when faced with the information, would probably not consent to it.""

Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health -- who has led a human-challenge trial for dengue and worked on another for malaria -- said she would be interested to hear how some prospective volunteers would respond to these reports of ""cerebral vascular accidents.""

""Millennials don't think they are going to get sick from this,"" said Durbin, who, like Read, is open to the idea of human challenge trials for Covid-19, but stresses that it is incumbent upon researchers to fully evaluate the risks of such a model and to share them to the fullest extent possible with prospective participants. ""We see lots of young people in the hospital on ventilators.""

Volunteers have different reasons for signing up -- some altruistic, some pragmatic

Rohrig said the frightening spate of young Covid-19 patients having strokes was news to him.

""That's jarring,"" he said. ""I know there is a non-trivial risk.""

And yet, Rohrig said he's almost certainly up for it.

""I know that there are risks, and if I were to do this, and it were to go poorly, then that would be terrible, my family would be really sad,"" Rohrig said. But ""someone has to step up. It seems like this just needs to happen.""

Not all of the prospective volunteers are in their 20s.

John Gentle, an entrepreneur in Alabama, turns 41 on Thursday. He has a wife and four kids. Like Rohrig, Gentle believes a challenge study would afford him a chance to make a societal contribution to the vaccine effort. But as the owner of a business that has him visiting warehouses and flying regularly, he figures he'll inevitably get infected -- so he might as well get it over with.

""I feel if I did it under a controlled environment, and I had an adverse reaction, my chances are much better in a controlled environment than I didn't know I had it for a week until something had deteriorated to the point I realized,"" Gentle said.

Indeed, human challenge studies occur in tightly controlled settings. The report in the Journal of Infectious Diseases advises keeping the subjects in isolation for several weeks and guaranteeing them access to the state-of-the-art facilities of the health system, should the need arise.

""As a part of being in the trial they would be guaranteed excellent care if they needed it,"" Lipsitch, a Harvard epidemiologist, told CNN. ""Of course, you would expect nobody in the trial on average would need it, but averages don't always play out.""

Over the years, he said, he has infected some 600 students with the disease. They typically ingest the disease via a sodium-bicarbonate drink resembling Alka-Seltzer and go home. There, they await the symptoms of typhoid -- for the study participants they include headache, fever and constipation -- which generally kick in within four or five days. At this point, he said, the volunteers with symptoms are given a regimen of antibiotics, which clear up the symptoms in a couple of days.

""We have extensive follow-up data and have not had any long-term problems identified,"" Darton said in an email. ""The model is safe and reproducible and is a model of mild symptomatic illness only.""

Today's standards for human-challenge trials are rigorous. Durbin of Johns Hopkins points out that it takes a minimum of six months of prep work to responsibly carry out a human-challenge trial.

This is in part because a suitable strain of the virus -- and the proper dosage -- must be developed in a lab outfitted with high biosafety standards. Also, researchers must find medical centers that are willing to house the participants in isolation for the duration of the study and provide first-rate care to anyone who falls seriously ill.

""I think it's very important that you plan for these studies now ... and you get it right,"" Durbin said. ""Yes, it may take time for a good human challenge model to be developed, but if we wait too long to develop it, then I think the moment has passed.""

Caring for volunteers can get tricky

One of the trickier aspects of a challenge study is compensation. Pay too little, and the study may fail to attract candidates; pay too much, and people could be enticed by the money without thinking of their safety.

The latter scenario played out with the yellow-fever trials, in which a participant who was hoping to start a farm in Cuba said it was a ""cold-blooded business decision."" The May 7 article in Science -- which concludes that the extraordinary nature of the Covid-19 pandemic warrants laying the groundwork for controlled human-infection trials -- recommends ""several thousand dollars.""

Seema Shah, a bioethicist and associate professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine -- and an author of the Science article -- said participants of a recent 40-day human-challenge study for malaria were paid about $2,300.

""Some were very motivated by the money, but others were also interested in the experience, and still others have strong motivations to help others,"" she said, adding that some participants personally knew sufferers of malaria and some even donated some of their earnings to charities.

The article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases likens the act of volunteering for a human-challenge trial to other public-service endeavors -- such as volunteer firefighting or organ donation.

""People are willing to take on life-threatening risk for other people's benefit and often not just as a job but as a form of altruistic behavior,"" Lipsitch said. ""We not only encourage that, but we completely depend on that in many sectors of our lives.""

Still, the onus is on the researchers to ensure that the participants stay safe.

""What keeps me up at night,"" said Durbin, ""is if I administer a challenge agent to somebody, and that person gets seriously ill or dies -- that's on me.""",mainstream

• TPP signing in New Zealand, a trade agreement that effectively usurped the power and authority of any State, the most significant of which is the clause which allows any multinational corporation to sue your government, and you as taxpayer, for lost future profits;
• The ongoing move towards Cashless Society to completely anchor your capacity to survive to the machines, on top of the ongoing bank bail-ins where your bank deposit is now earning negative interest [remember Cyprus skimming bank accounts?] and you cannot withdraw any significant amount from your own bank account any given day;
• The ongoing Khazarian Empire’s defeat in Syria and the rest of the Middle East, and Eurasia;
• The fiat financial crash that is resulting from the systematic move by the BRICS to do away with the petrodollar. The BRICS is now having their own global development bank, SWIFT alternative, GPS alternative, and is implementing a gradual shift from oil through hybrid fusion-fission nuclear reactors.

One cannot possibly fathom the depth of desperation on the part of the Rothschild dynasty losing their carefully crafted Khazarian Empire. This is the reason why, in order to keep them still in power, they have to keep on using the only weapons they have left against their own people in the West, i.e. HAARP, bioweapons, mass media and fiat financial system.

 (Note: all source links for this article can be found at the blog post, here.)

 I can now provide the latest update on what researchers in Brazil are discovering, as they dig into their original findings about the Zika virus and cases of microcephaly (babies born with small heads and brain impairment).

 A correspondent has offered a translation of an article that appeared in one of the major Sao Paulo newspapers, O Estado de São Paulo, on February 2nd, :

 It is obvious that no significant connection between microcephaly and the Zika virus has been found. It’s not even close. So far, therefore, there is absolutely no reason to trumpet an epidemic of Zika. Doing so is quite insane, by any reasonable standard.

 Here are the principal facts in the article (after which I’ll comment):
• As of January 30, 2015, 4,783 suspected cases of microcephaly were reported in Brazil.
• Of those, 3,670 suspected cases of microcephaly, covering the entire country of Brazil, are being investigated.
• Of those 3,670, 404 cases have been confirmed as microcephaly or “other alterations in the central nervous system” of babies.
• Of those 404 cases, 17 “had a relationship with zika virus.”
• 98% of the 404 microcephaly cases come from the Northeast area of Brazil, and in that area, Pernambuco has the highest number of cases: 56.

Now, let’s take each one of these reported facts and examine it.

 First: 4,783 suspected cases of microcephaly in Brazil. “Suspected” is the operative word. This number means nothing, because it says nothing about confirmation. It’s just a raw figure.

 3,670 of these cases are being researched.

 Of these 3,670, 404 have been confirmed as microcephaly or other alterations in the central nervous system of the babies. The key word here is “or.” The researchers don’t know how many of the 404 babies have microcephaly. At the very most, it would be 404. 404 cases of microcephaly in the whole country of Brazil, so far. That is not an epidemic. For example, every year in the US, there are 25,000 cases of microcephaly. And the literature is very clear about causes: any insult to the fetal brain during pregnancy can result in microcephaly. Severe malnutrition, falling down stairs, a blow to the stomach, a toxic street drug or medical drug or vaccine or pesticide, and so on.

 Of these 404 cases of (possible) microcephaly in Brazil, 17 babies have been found who “have a relationship with the Zika virus.” It’s hard to be more vague. But for the sake of argument, let’s say that in each of the 17, with a correct test done properly, the Zika virus was isolated. This finding does not even remotely approach proof that Zika is causing microcephaly. It’s miles away from proof. Any honest researcher will tell you that. If Zika were the cause, researchers should have been able to find it in the overwhelming majority of the 404 babies. 17 out of 404 is, in fact, major evidence that Zika is not the cause.

 98% of the 404 (possible) microcephaly cases come from the Northeast region of Brazil. Before jumping to any conclusions, realize that standards on reporting such cases differ from region to region. Up until now, there was no national focus on microcephaly. So there may be other cases from other regions. As for the 56 cases in Pernambuco, understand that the population of this area is 9.27 million people. It is significant to note that commercial agriculture is widespread in Pernambuco, and agriculture means toxic pesticides—an important causal factor in microcephaly, as I’ve detailed in other articles.

 To sum up, researchers so far have found 404 cases of microcephaly in Brazil, and who knows how many of those are actually some other kind of nervous-system impairment. And of those 404 babies, they have found, at best, 17 cases where the Zika virus was present.

 And this is the epidemic that is shaking the world.

 The World Health Organization (WHO) is spearheading the baseless propaganda and the hysteria. At the very least, hundreds of employees from WHO should be immediately fired from their jobs, if not jailed.

380,"Latest on global search for coronavirus vaccine: Three candidates show early promise

An all-out global race to develop a safe vaccine against coronavirus is underway. The stakes couldn't be higher: an effective vaccine or treatment against the virus that causes COVID-19 is necessary to fully restart economies and resume civic life.

As the pace accelerates, USA TODAY is rounding up some of the week's most notable vaccine developments.

They include a massive contract by the U.S. government to get dibs on a possible vaccine that may or may not work, very early but promising news on two different vaccine candidates, one from China and one from the United States, and a caution that sometimes biology can't be sped up as much as we might want.

A vaccine could work, which we didn't know before

Given all the discussion of a coronavirus vaccine in the news, it can be difficult to remember a crucial fact was missing — whether people who have recovered from COVID-19 were immune to getting it again.

If protective immunity was possible, a vaccine was also likely possible. Until this week that hadn’t been established, even in animals.

Now it has been. A study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston published in the journal Science on Wednesday found that nine rhesus macaque monkeys which had recovered from COVID-19 developed natural protective immunity against re-infection with the virus.

Not all viruses generate natural protective immunity, so scientists had worried people could potentially be infected over and over again. The monkey data makes that seem less likely.

“Our findings increase optimism that the development of COVID-19 vaccines will be possible,” said the study’s leader, Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist who is also a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

Chinese researchers on Friday published a study in the British medical journal The Lancet on an early candidate vaccine tested on 108 healthy adults in Wuhan, China.

Within two weeks of getting the vaccine, the immune systems of people receiving all three doses showed some level of response, with most developing a type of antibody that can attach to the virus, though not necessarily destroy it. Some also developed so-called neutralizing antibodies, which can kill the virus.

The vaccine is from CanSino Biologics in Tianjin, China. The trial is in the early stages and it is not yet known if the possible vaccine can generate enough of these neutralizing antibodies to protect people against the virus.

The candidate vaccine is scheduled to be tested in Canada soon. The Canadian Center for Vaccinology is working with CanSino and Canada’s National Research Council to coordinate the trial. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the announcement during a press briefing.

CanSino chairman Xuefeng Yu worked in Canada from 1996 to 2009.

$1.2 billion for first dibs on untried vaccine

On Thursday the United States has pledged to pay as much as $1.2 billion to get early access to 300 million doses of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine being developed and tested in England by the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute and licensed to British drugmaker AstraZeneca.

It is expected to be delivered as early as October, though that means only that the doses will be stored until the vaccine completes clinical trials ensuring it is safe and effective in protecting against COVID-19 infection. If it isn't, they'll be destroyed.

The vaccine is still in very early clinical trials in humans and is being tested for safety, whether it produces antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and whether it protects the immunized from becoming infected with the virus. The first tests began in England on April 23.

Last week Oxford reported that a single dose of the vaccine caused six rhesus macaque monkeys to develop antibodies to coronavirus within 28 days but did not protect them from becoming infected with COVID-19.

The vaccine, called ChAdOx1, did prevent them from developing pneumonia and lung inflammatory disease when the animals were exposed to the virus.

On Monday, Moderna announced its candidate vaccine appeared to be safe when given to eight humans and that it stimulated an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Experts called it a ""so far, so good"" finding.

Participants in the Phase 1 clinical trial tests made neutralizing antibodies to the virus. When tested on human cells in the laboratory the antibodies stopped the virus from reproducing.

After two doses of the candidate vaccine, participants' antibody levels were about the same as in people who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection.

There is no data yet on whether the candidate vaccine protects against becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Slow is fast when it comes to vaccines

An editorial in the respected journal Science cautioned against effort to speed up testing of potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.

While many advocates have suggested fast-tracking vaccine trials in humans, deputy editor Douglas Green says while clinical trials, especially the large-scale Phase III portion, are time consuming, they are vital to ensuring a vaccine is safe and effective.

All the vaccine candidates that have been in the news so far are in Phase 1 and Phase 2, meant to test that the vaccine itself doesn't cause reactions and that it causes the body to mount an immune response.

Moving too fast on Phase 3 could be ""catastrophic,"" Green wrote. There are examples of preliminary vaccines that produced neutralizing antibodies but when large trials were conducted they made infections worse.

That happened in a 1966 trial of a vaccine against Respiratory Syncytial Virus, RVS. Subjects who got the vaccine actually did worse when infected with the virus. Green cautions that many scientists believe proper testing will mean an effective vaccine won't be widely available for 12 to 18 months.

He quoted cancer biologist Charles Sherr, who told him, “Fast is slow, and slow is fast.”",mainstream
1293,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A decision by Japan to stop recommending adolescent girls receive a HPV vaccination will likely result in almost 11,000 deaths from cervical cancer if it is not reversed, according to a study in a prestigious medical journal.

The HPV vaccine has been a political lightening rod in Japan, where claims of side effects prompted the government to halt active recommendation of the shots in June 2013.

A study published in The Lancet Public Health on Monday said that policy would lead to more than 24,600 cervical cancer cases that could have been prevented.

Using Japanese population and medical data and forecasted cervical cancer incidence, the study found that, if nothing changes, there would be 10,800 preventable deaths from cervical cancer over the next 50 years.

“If the government were to resume promoting the HPV vaccine in Japan, our study shows that we could avoid most of this loss of life,” said study co-author Sharon Hanley, a professor at Hokkaido University in northern Japan.

The Japanese government could not immediately be reached for comment on the Lancet report. Kei Tamura, deputy director of the Health Ministry’s immunization office, said in an interview in December that “there is a sort of inner conflict in that we are not aggressively, proactively recommending it, but I do think it’s better to take it.”

HPV, which stands for the human papilloma virus, causes genital warts in both sexes and cervical cancer in women. Each year, about 10,000 Japanese women are newly diagnosed with the cancer while 3,000 die from it.

Uptake was swift when the vaccine was introduced in Japan in 2009, with immunization reaching about 70% in adolescent girls.

However, the vaccination rate has since slid to below 1% after the health ministry suspended its active recommendation after reports of side effects including muscle pain, sleep disorders, and light and sound sensitivity.

Females aged 12-16 can still get free HPV vaccines under Japan’s national healthcare system if they ask for it. Everyone else must pay out of pocket.

In November, ruling party legislator Junko Mihara, a cervical cancer survivor, said lawmakers would hold talks on the vaccine this summer. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and eight other regional leaders signed a letter supporting HPV vaccination.

The Health Ministry said in December it was working on improving leaflets on the vaccine, but had no time table for a return to regular immunization.",mainstream
192,"The measure, which defines a public place as anywhere ""more than 10 persons are intended to congregate"" — including public transport — was announced by officials in Rockland County, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of New York City. Due to come into effect at midnight on Wednesday and last for 30 days, it appears to be the most radical step by US officials following outbreaks in several regions blamed on the anti-vaccination movement.

""We must do everything in our power to end this outbreak and protect the health of those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and that of children too young to be vaccinated,"" said county executive Ed Day. He also criticized the ""resistance"" to health inspectors by some locals.

Rockland County, with a population of over 300,000, has registered 153 cases of measles, which had been declared officially eliminated in 2000. Despite major vaccination campaigns since the outbreak began in October, around 27 percent of minors aged one to 18 remain unvaccinated, Day said.

The worst affected neighborhoods are those with a high ultra-Orthodox Jewish population, where many oppose vaccines on religious grounds. Vaccinations are in theory required to go to school in the United States, but 47 of the 50 states — including New York — allow exemptions, notably for religious reasons.

At the beginning of March, the UN Children's Fund UNICEF sounded the alarm because of the rapidly increasing number of measles cases in some regions of the world.

Worldwide, 98 countries recorded more cases in 2018 than in the previous year. Reports also came from countries that had previously been measles-free, including Brazil, where more than 10,000 people were infected with measles last year. In the Philippines, around 13,000 people have contracted measles and more than 76,000 have in Madagascar since last September. The situation is also particularly dramatic in Ukraine, where 24,000 people have been infected with the dangerous virus in the first weeks of this year alone.

Will vaccination become compulsory… in Germany?

According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the number of reported cases in Germany fell from 929 in 2017 to 543 last year. Nevertheless, Germany is still debating controversially requiring measles vaccinations, originally demanded in March by the SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach. Most recently, Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) advocated for compulsory measles vaccinations for school-aged children.

But even their own parties had reservations about the proposals. Karin Maag (CDU), spokeswoman for health policy for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag, rejected compulsory vaccination, partly because there is a lack of knowledge about the advantages of compulsory vaccinations as introduced in Italy and France.

The Robert Koch Institute has also been cautious. In Germany, for example, there was no noticeable increase in infections. Nevertheless, the vaccination rate could always be improved, especially among young adults.

Until the beginning of the 1990s, each person only received one vaccination against measles. It was difficult adopt the practice of getting a second vaccination, especially for those vaccinated prior to the 1990s. In contrast, 97% of school children in Germany have the first measles vaccination and 93% have the second vaccination. The second measles vaccination, which should be carried out by the end of the second year of life, is often carried out later. According to the RKI, only 74% of two-year-olds in Germany have full protection.

The first telltale sign someone has measles is a widespread itchy red rash. The spots are initially visible behind the ears, or on the neck or head. Three days before visible signs appear, the virus has peaked in the body. The infected person is contagious, usually without even knowing it. For a reliable diagnosis, patients suspected of having the virus need to have the antibodies in their blood tested.

The measles virus is transmitted directly through the air in the form of very fine droplets of saliva or mucus — usually from coughing or sneezing. But they can also be passed on simply when speaking to someone in close proximity.

Measles is highly contagious. Each contagious person infects around 15 healthy people. Humans are the only natural hosts of the measles virus.

About 14 days after the initial infection, patients get a fever and start coughing. At that point, the red rash starts to itch.

To alleviate these symptoms, doctors usually administer medication. Patients may also get a middle ear infection, pneumonia or have severe diarrhea. In the worst case, diarrhea can lead to dehydration and ultimately death. There is no specialized treatment for measles. The body has to fight the infection itself.

Measles can cause meningitis, which can lead to severe brain damage and mental disability. According to Germany's main public health body, the Robert Koch Institute, measles encephalitis occurs in one in every 1,000 infections. One in five of these cases is fatal. Such complications do not necessarily occur during the original bout of the disease; they can occur years later.

Vaccination is the best protection

Many parents refuse to vaccinate their children because they fear serious side effects. Some assume it is better for their children to be infected with the virus so their bodies can build up anti-bodies. For a while, measles parties were popular.

Parents would send healthy children to play with other children who had the virus in the hope they too might become infected. Parents who did this were often convinced that exposure to the virus strengthened their child's defenses if and when they got measles.

Experts, however, are convinced this is not the case. False claims and beliefs contribute to vaccination fatigue. The myth that there is a connection between the measles vaccination and autism is just that — a myth — and one doctors have debunked many times over.

The measles vaccine includes two shots of attenuated measles viruses. The Permanent Vaccination Commission (STIKO) of the Robert Koch Institute recommends measles vaccinations in combination with inoculations for mumps and rubella. The vaccinations should take place just after a child turns one. Only then can parents ensure their child is protected from the dangerous virus.

The WHO was committed to eradicating measles worldwide by 2020. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Portugal, Slovakia and Slovenia are the only countries to have achieved this goal so far.

1229,"Imperial College has promised that VacEquity Global Health will make its vaccine available at the lowest possible cost in Britain, as well as in low- and middle-income countries. VacEquity would work with specialized drug manufacturers, in a process similar to the production and sale of generic drugs.

The new company may charge higher prices in wealthier countries such as the United States, Singapore, or the Persian Gulf monarchies.

A clinical trial involving 300 participants in Britain — an unusual combined phase one and two — is set to begin on June 15. If that shows the drug to be safe, Imperial College will conduct a 6,000-participant phase in October to test the vaccine’s effectiveness. The location of the later phase will depend on where the virus is spreading rapidly at the time.

The Imperial College is using a novel technology that has never before produced a licensed vaccine. It is described as self-amplifying RNA and was pioneered by Professor Shattock over decades of research. The vaccine consists of specially engineered genetic material — RNA — that instructs muscle cells in the body to produce a distinctive “spike” protein found on the surface of the coronavirus.

If the vaccine is successful, those proteins will trigger an immune response that will kill the virus.

Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Mass., has started clinical trials for a vaccine using similar technology, known as messenger RNA. The U.S. government has agreed to provide as much as $483 million to Moderna to advance its research, and reports of positive results in the trial’s early stages have sent the company’s stock soaring.

Imperial College’s self-amplifying RNA vaccine, Professor Shattock said, would require a much smaller dose than the Moderna vaccine — 50 to 100 times smaller — which would greatly lower the cost per dose. The Imperial College vaccine would also require smaller and less costly manufacturing facilities than vaccines using other technologies, such as those involving the neutralized or modified versions of existing viruses, he said.",mainstream
453,"American drug maker Moderna said Monday that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced antibodies in a small group of healthy people in an early trial.

The company said eight people who received two small amounts of its vaccine developed antibodies similar to those developed by people who have recovered from the disease.

The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases led the experiment, also called a trial. It involved 45 volunteers who received one or two shots of differing amounts of the vaccine.

Tal Zaks is the chief medical officer at Moderna. Based on early results of the trial, he said the vaccine “has the potential to prevent COVID-19 disease….” He also said the company now can better choose the vaccine amount needed for further experiments.

The testing involved three different amounts. Zaks said the two smaller amounts of vaccine seem safe and the larger amount caused some short-term side effects. Three study subjects developed “flu-like” conditions following a second shot of the large dose. Moderna said it plans to drop that amount for the next part of the trial.

Amesh Adalja is an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was not involved in the study. He told Reuters that the findings are meaningful, but noted that they come from only eight people. “It was designed for safety. Not for efficacy,” he said.



 Moderna has been permitted to start a second part of human testing that will involve several hundreds of people. In April, the U.S. government gave the company $483 million for vaccine development. Last week, U.S. officials gave the vaccine special recognition to help speed the process for approval.

Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna, said the company is hoping to start part three of the study in July. The company will try to find the lowest amount of vaccine necessary to protect people.

In May, Moderna and the biotechnology company Lonza agreed to work together over the next ten years to make a vaccine. The partnership could lead to the manufacture of 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine treatments a year.

There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19. Almost 4.8 million people are confirmed to have had the virus. It is known to have killed about 320,000. However, experts think the numbers may be underreported.

The World Health Organization has listed more than 100 efforts to develop effective treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus. The list includes clinical trials in China, at the University of Oxford, and with American drug makers Pfizer, Inovio and Moderna.

Experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop. The results of Moderna’s early trial have not been published. But the news lifted the company’s stock prices and spread hope that a solution against the infectious disease might be close.

422,"Scientists claim that autism has been around for over 1,000 years and has remained consistently as prevalent as it is in today’s work — with 1 in every 166 in the U.S. being born with autism.

However, within the Amish community autism does not exist. Why is this? It looks like the answer to this question leads to a much bigger revelation about the cause of autism itself.

Since they have been cut off for hundreds of years from American culture and scientific progress, the Amish may have had less exposure to some new factor triggering autism in the rest of population. The likely culprit: vaccines.

Traveling to the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country in search of autistic Amish children, the reporter, based on national statistics, should have found as many as 200 children with autism in the community — instead, he found only three, the oldest age 9 or 10:

The first autistic Amish child was a girl who had been brought over from China, adopted by one family only to be given up after becoming overwhelmed by her autism, and then re-adopted by an Amish Mennonite family.

The second autistic Amish child definitely had received a vaccination and developed autism shortly thereafter. The reporter was unable to determine the vaccination status of the third child.

In some vaccines, they use a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal that keeps multiple-dose vials from becoming contaminated by repeated needle sticks.

After health officials became concerned about the amount of mercury infants and children were receiving through thimerosal-tainted vaccines, the toxin was phased out of U.S. vaccines starting in 1999.

However, due to mislabeling and other problems, its presence is still being felt, and more and more children are suffering because of it.

Does anyone out there really need more evidence than this?

Admittedly, this was not a placebo-controlled scientific trial but an evidence-based fact analysis that, in my mind, provides an irrefutable link to a lifestyle and, most likely, mercury-containing vaccine connection to autism.

Folks, you don’t have to be a medical doctor, hold advanced epidemiology degrees or teach molecular genetics to figure this one out. You don’t even need a degree in rocket science. How much more obvious could it be?

The link between autism and vaccines is certainly not a new idea. In fact, suggestions of this link have been in the national news for at least six years now.

Just last year a study, that reviewed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Vaccine Data Link, concluded that children who receive thimerosal-containing vaccinations are 27 times more likely to develop autism than children who do not.

This most recent investigation simply provides the proverbial icing on the cake. There aren’t too many other places, if any, in America where you can find large groups of children who haven’t been vaccinated.

The reporter found three children with autism. One child was adopted and previously vaccinated, another was one of the few Amish children who were vaccinated, and the third had an unclear vaccine history.

That leaves, at most, potentially one child out of an expected 200 (from national statistics) with autism. The odds of this being mere coincidence are slim to none.

At Least Change the Rules Concerning the Hepatitis B Vaccine

Because of their religious beliefs, the Amish community chooses not to give their children any vaccines. Understandably, many of you may not choose such a radical approach. However, if you were to focus on just one vaccine, I would encourage you to look at the issues surrounding the hepatitis B vaccine.

The multi-dose version of this vaccine, which is typically administered to newborns before they leave the hospital, still contains thimerosal. This is reprehensible, irresponsible negligence of the highest magnitude.

The immature central nervous systems of these helpless newborns are particularly susceptible to toxic insults, and thimerosal, the mercury-containing preservative used in these vaccines, is one of the worst.

It would be much easier to understand if the hepatitis B vaccine had some value, but most natural health experts who study this are convinced that this is nearly always an absolutely unnecessary vaccine.

There are only about 5,000 people a year who develop the most serious consequence of hepatitis B infection, liver cancer.

That means we are immunizing tens of millions of infants and causing brain injury that has caused an epidemic of autism to protect liver cancer in 5,000 adults.

And, many of these adults have serious social problems like IV drug abuse, alcoholism and poor nutrition that seriously increases their risk for this disease.

If you’re a young parent weighing the pros and cons of vaccines, I strongly urge you to learn more about the toxicity of thimerosal, which, again, is still present in multi-dose hepatitis B vaccines, and nearly all the mandated flu vaccine for infants.",conspiracy
1209,"As a public health emergency of international concern, the COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus) has drawn global attention and response. As of 19 March 2020, 51 of 53 countries in the WHO European Region have reported confirmed COVID-19 cases. Each of these countries has initiated a range of measures to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the impact of the outbreak on healthcare systems, including shifting of healthcare resources to the COVID-19 response.

In planning these measures, due consideration should be given to minimizing the excess risk of morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) that would result if immunization services are disrupted. Any disruption of immunization services, even for short periods, will result in an accumulation of susceptible individuals, and a higher likelihood of VPD outbreaks.

Antibodies are proteins that recognise and fight off germs, such as viruses, that have invaded your blood.

Find out more about how vaccines work

There are 3 types of flu viruses:
• Type A flu virus – this is usually the more serious type. The virus is most likely to mutate into a new version that people are not resistant to. The H1N1 (swine flu) strain is a type A virus, and flu pandemics in the past were type A viruses.
• Type B flu virus – this generally causes a less severe illness and is responsible for smaller outbreaks. It mainly affects young children.
• Type C flu virus – this usually causes a mild illness similar to the common cold.

Most years, 1 or 2 strains of type A flu circulate, as well as type B.

How the annual flu vaccine changes

In February each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the strains of flu virus that are most likely to be circulating in the northern hemisphere over the following winter.

Based on this assessment, WHO recommends which flu strains the vaccines should contain for the forthcoming winter.

Flu vaccines protect against 3 or 4 types of flu virus (usually 2 A types and 1 or 2 B types). Vaccine manufacturers produce flu vaccines based on WHO's recommendations.

For most flu vaccines, the strains of the viruses are grown either in hens' eggs or mammalian cells. These flu vaccines are used in all the countries in the northern hemisphere, not just the UK.

Production of the vaccine starts in March each year after WHO's announcement. The vaccine is usually available in the UK from September.

The flu vaccine cannot give you flu

The injected flu vaccine given to adults contains inactivated flu viruses, so it cannot give you flu.

The children's nasal spray flu vaccine contains live but weakened flu viruses that will not give your child flu.

923,"America's nurses strongly encourage health care workers and patients to get vaccinated.

But nurses, joined by many physician organizations and researchers, reject the notion that vaccination is a fail-safe solution to prevent the spread of the flu virus. We oppose forced vaccinations or the related mandate that those who decline the shots must wear masks or risk losing their jobs.

Vaccinations are not foolproof protection. Los Angeles County's public health director Jonathan Fielding recently told the Los Angeles Times that the vaccine is only 62% effective, and he did not want to give the false impression it was the perfect antidote.

It's not. A 2005 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study over 20 years found no correlation between increased vaccine use and a decrease in deaths.

Second, there are health reasons why some elect not to be vaccinated. Some vaccine products have been withdrawn, as when Bell's palsy developed for many recipients. It has just been reported that 800 European children contracted narcolepsy, an incurable sleep disorder, after receiving the swine flu vaccine.

Mandating masks is even less effective, with no scientific evidence in support. Surgical masks are designed to prevent dispersion, not inhalation of airborne particles, creating a misleading sense of protection. The masks make sense only when put on patients or workers who are actively coughing or sneezing.

Nurses understand that voluntary vaccinations are just part of a successful program of protections for patients.

Such a program includes rigorous cleaning of hospital surfaces and disinfecting patient rooms; promoting frequent hand washing with soap; screening and isolating contagious patients when they arrive in the ER or are admitted to the hospital; and promoting education on infectious control measures, including vaccination.

Too many hospitals, whose mantra is profits, not patient safety, favor forced vaccinations while cutting nursing or housekeeping staff, and denying paid sick leave, as most industrialized nations ensure. Lack of sick time helped spread 5 million cases of flu-like illnesses during the swine flu outbreak, the American Journal of Public Health reported.

Threatening caregivers only creates a more hostile, less therapeutic environment, and is counter to the mission of healing, recovery and public safety.

156,"In June of 2012, Donald Trump told Fox News on the anniversary of the fifth annual World Autism Awareness Day he is concerned about vaccines.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have for many years denied a possible link between mercury in vaccines and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, in October 2011, the CDC has been caught deliberately fudging data to try to cover up evidence linking mercury in vaccines with ASD. [1]

To conceal any incriminating vaccine data, the CDC had handed its massive database of vaccine records over to a private company, effectively pronouncing it off-limits to researchers and preventing dissemination of the data through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

However, this didn’t stop the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs (CoMeD). During an enquiry through FOIA it was discovered, as suspected, that the same original Danish study which the CDC referred to as “definitive evidence” that Thimerosal does not increase a child’s chances of developing ASD, actually revealed the exact opposite to be true. The Danish research is irrefutably clear about the findings: *Thimerosal in vaccines increases a person’s chances of developing autism and other neurological diseases. *

In the United States, at least one in every 100 vaccinated children is afflicted with ASD, while only 1 in every 2,000 non-vaccinated children has the disease. In European countries like Iceland, where children receive just one-third the number of vaccines shots, only 1 in 30,000 children has ASD. In the US, now 1 in every 88 children has ASD, according to a statement made by the CDC in March 2012, citing statistics from the year 2008. In those US states where children receive the most vaccines, or where relatively more children become vaccinated, as for example in Utah and New Jersey, as many as 1 in 47 children develop ASD. By comparison, in the mostly rural state of Iowa where fewer children become vaccinated, 1 in 718 children have autism. [2]

If the overall trend increase has been consistent since 2008, which appears to be the case, then 1 in every 63 children in the US now has ASD (year 2012). One doesn’t need to be a scientist to make sense of this man-made tragedy.

The FDA is not an innocent bystander in this conspiracy against the health of the American people. Both the CDC and FDA have tried to conceal from concerned parents that the vaccines still contain mercury. In a recent court hearing the FDA unintentionally admitted that flu vaccines now routinely given to babies as young as six months of age contain it, according to *Courthouse News Service* on Friday, March 23, 2012. [3]

“The Food and Drug Administration is not liable for approving a mercury-based vaccine preservative because more expensive, mercury-free vaccines are available upon request,” a federal judge ruled. “Thimerosal-preserved flu vaccines are necessary to ensure sufficient supply at a reasonable price,” according to the judgment.

The problem with this questionable ‘solution’ to allegedly avoid mercury poisoning of American babies is that most doctors neither inform parents about what flu vaccines really contain, nor recommend the other, less toxic options. Most parents still trust their child’s pediatrician and do what they are told. And why pay for an expensive vaccine, when there is a cheaper one available, especially when the doctor insists that the vaccine (containing mercury) is completely safe? The FDA has no intention of hanging a poster on the wall of a pediatrician’s office that could says something like this: “Attention parents: beware that the flu shot your child may be receiving today contains brain-damaging mercury!”

“While the use of mercury-containing preservatives has declined in recent years with the development of new products formulated with alternativeor no preservatives, thimerosal has been used in some immune globulin preparations, anti-venins, skin test antigens, and ophthalmic and nasal products, in addition to certain vaccines,” writes the FDA on its Thimerosal in Vaccines web page (www.fda.go).

Thimerosal is a mercury-based compound that is FDA-approved as a vaccine preservative, which makes it perfectly legal for doctors to inject this powerful neurotoxin into babies. Besides, doctors and pharmaceutical companies are no longer liable for causing vaccine injuries, including death.

One average flu vaccine contains 25 micrograms of mercury and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stipulates a safety limit of 5 micrograms. Case in point, children who are vaccinated against the flu receive over 500 percent more mercury in one day than is considered safe by the very governmental agency responsible for keeping us safe from

 environmental toxins.

The FDA also avoids informing the public that the aluminum phosphate added to these vaccines greatly increases toxicity of mercury, thereby turning the *minimum mercury tolerance* level into a complete joke—a joke that can cause severe brain damage to an unsuspecting child, and untold suffering and financial hardship to his parents. After millions of parents found that their children became autistic after receiving vaccine shots, there was a massive increase in class action lawsuits against the vaccine-producing pharmaceutical companies, Wyeth, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Merck & Co. and Sanofi-Aventis SA. A. As a result, the vaccine makers threatened the Obama Administration that they would stop producing vaccines altogether unless they received complete immunity from prosecution for vaccine injuries.

In 2010 the Supreme Court of Justice passed a new law that granted these drug giants the requested immunity. Since then, they have free reign in packing any kind of toxic compounds into their vaccine products, and nobody can stop them. By adding toxic, carcinogenic ingredients to their vaccines, they generate an ever-increasing number of new patients that require medical treatments which mostly consist of medical drugs that they also

 produce.

The cover-ups by the CDC and FDA have let those responsible for the huge autism epidemic, which began when mercury and adjuvants were first added to vaccines, off the hook. Without this elaborate conspiracy against the people, libel lawsuits resulting from permanent vaccine injuries in children would have bankrupted numerous governments, including the United States and Great Britain, and almost the entire pharmaceutical industry.

Donald Trump Speak Out

 Thankfully, some very influential spokespeople and celebrities are now coming to the aid of the ostracized vaccine safety awareness movement, including business mogul Donald Trump. During an interview with Fox News on April 2, 2012, the anniversary of the fifth annual World Autism Awareness Day, Trump unexpectedly raised serious concern about vaccinations. He told viewers he “*strongly* believes that Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are linked to exposure to vaccines.” [4]

Trump has been actively engaged in helping children with autism for many years. During the interview, the tycoon explained that a series of casual observations had led him to the conclusion that “monster” vaccinations cause autism.

Trump’s remarks must have been a bombshell for the most aggressive vaccine-pushers, including doctors, pharmaceutical companies, the government’s health agencies and, of course, the most powerful vaccine advocate, Bill Gates. They all deny a vaccine-autism link exists by referring to the fraudulently altered research data the CDC released in 2008. They have exerted monumental efforts in trying to suppress and delegitimize the work that has been done on vaccine-caused autism by researchers at several universities and, most notably, by Dr Andrew Wakefield. Fortunately, through a ruling by Britain’s High Court, Dr Wakefield’s key research colleague, Professor John Walker-Smith, has recently been vindicated of having falsified research proving the vaccine-autism link. [5] In other words, the work by these two scientists is now considered genuine and valid.

While Trump acknowledged that speaking out against vaccines and the vaccineschedule is controversial, he said “…I couldn’t care less. I’ve seenpeople where they have a perfectly healthy child, and they go for the vaccinations and a month later the child is no longer healthy.”

“I’ve gotten to be pretty familiar with the subject,” Trump went on to say. “You know, I have a theory — and it’s a theory that some people believe in — and that’s the vaccinations. We never had anything like this. This is now an epidemic. It’s way, way up over the past 10 years. It’s way up over the past two years. And, you know, when you take a little baby that weighs like 12 pounds into a doctor’s office and they pump them with many, many simultaneous vaccinations — I’m all for vaccinations, but I think when you add all of these vaccinations together and then two months later the baby is so different then lots of different things have happened. I really — I’ve known cases.”

Usually, the media which are sponsored, in large part, through advertisements paid for by pharmaceutical companies, have a financial interest in keeping their sponsors happy. I personally would like to thank Donald Trump for bringing this important issue, which concerns so many millions of individuals and their families, back into the minds of the people. He has clearly shown that he is not afraid of surprising one of the world’s leading news channels by issuing such as stern warning.

936,"Social restrictions could be kept in place in the UK for the rest of the year, it has been confirmed.

Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Government, told the public it was “wholly unrealistic” to expect life to return to normal soon.

Speaking as part of the Government’s daily briefing on the coronavirus crisis, Whitty said that “in the long run” the ideal way for life to return to normal would be via a “highly effective vaccine” for Covid-19, but said the chance of this becoming a reality within the next year was “incredibly small”.

“This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear,” he continued. “So we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally… for the foreseeable future.”

While UK schools have been given a prospective reopening date of June 1, mass gatherings such as concerts or festivals and cramped commuting appear to be a more distant prospect.

Whitty continued: “In the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally. “A vaccine, and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed… or highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people.”

“So what we have to do is think very seriously about this: what is the best balance of measures that gives us the best public health outcome?”

Last week, healthcare experts made predictions that live concerts and festivals will not return until autumn 2021.

“Larger gatherings – conferences, concerts, sporting events – when people say they’re going to reschedule this conference or graduation event for October 2020, I have no idea how they think that’s a plausible possibility, bioethicist and professor of healthcare management Zeke Emanuel said during a conference.

“I think those things will be the last to return,” he continued.

980,"Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy Wednesday announced the formation of a vaccine alliance aimed at ensuring that a possible future coronavirus vaccine is available and affordable for Europeans.

The four countries have come together under the “Inclusive Vaccine Alliance,” which will look to make sure that Europe not only gets a vaccine at a good price from pharmaceutical companies, but that European production capabilities are prioritized.

In a statement, the Dutch health ministry says the alliance intends to work with the European Commission and is already in talks with various pharmaceutical companies. It is also offering other EU member countries the opportunity to take part in any initiatives arising from the collaboration.

In addition, Deputy Prime Minister and Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said in a letter announcing the initiative that the alliance is focusing on the “stimulation of vaccine production in European facilities.”

While the aim is to secure access to a vaccine for Europe, de Jonge said the alliance would seek ways to use the available capacity to secure access for more vulnerable countries such as those in Africa.

Today's announcement comes as countries around the globe seek to shore up their manufacturing capacity and secure preorders of potential future vaccines with pharmaceutical companies.

370,"An anti-corruption watchdog group is urging the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate top executives at Moderna, the biotech firm developing a promising coronavirus vaccine, for allegedly manipulating the stock market.

""This misconduct was particularly egregious because it involved not only financial fraud and manipulation of the financial markets, but also because it exploited widespread fears surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" wrote Kyle Herrig, who heads Accountable.US, in a letter to the SEC. ""I strongly urge the SEC to investigate these matters.""

The group's concerns center on insider trading activity at Moderna after the company last month announced positive results in Phase 1 trials of its coronavirus vaccine. The news pushed up the company's stock price 30% to an all-time high of $87. In the days following the announcement, Moderna's CEO, other executives and funds controlled by the chairman of its board sold about $90 million worth of company shares.

Accountable.US sent its letter, a copy of which was provided to CBS MoneyWatch, on Tuesday to Joseph Sansone, who heads the SEC's market abuse unit. The agency declined to comment on the letter or whether it is looking into allegations against Moderna and its executives. Herrig said he hasn't received a response from the SEC.

Moderna on Wednesday defended the stock sales that aroused Accountable.US' suspicion.

""Executive sales are made under pre-planned 10b5-1 plans, which are executed during open trading windows in accordance with the company's insider trading policy,"" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. ""As a matter of practice, Moderna does not intend to comment on any alleged or potential litigation or investigation; nor on purchases or sales by individual investors or groups.""

Moderna's vaccine results have yet to be reviewed by outside experts or published in a medical journal, and some have questioned whether the company was too quick in publicizing the trial data. Shares of the company sunk as low as $52 last week, but have since rebounded to $59, slightly below its stock price before the preliminary testing results were released.

Moderna's executives have continued to sell their shares. On Tuesday, the company disclosed that CEO Stephane Bancel had cashed in an additional $1.9 million in stock. Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks also netted an additional $6.7 million in stock sales in which he liquidated his entire holding of Moderna shares, according to a filing with the SEC. Zaks still holds options to buy an additional 118,000 Moderna shares.

In the letter to the SEC, Herrig called the timing of the post-announcment trades suspicious, and questioned whether the company and the executives had coordinated ahead of releasing the trial results, including when the shares would be sold. Accountable.US is a non-profit supported by the New Venture Fund, which funds left-leaning policy groups.

""Evidence suggests that Moderna and at least two of its officers, possibly among others, may have improperly exploited coronavirus fears to boost the company's value, as well as their own bank accounts,"" Herrig wrote.

On Wednesday, medical news website Stat reported that Bancel recently told investors at a conference that Moderna rushed out its coronavirus testing results in order to avoid a possible leak of the findings. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease official, said that the Phase 3 trial of Moderna's vaccine could start as early as July.",mainstream
1299,"Laura Dye was all for childhood vaccinations until she had her first child. Then she got cold feet after reading what she now calls “scare mongering” online.

""I was super scared about vaccines,"" says Dye, who lives in southern Delaware. ""It was my new little baby. He was so perfect.""

She wanted to limit vaccines out of concern they might harm her newborn son. Her husband, Jared, wanted their new son fully vaccinated. “He had a great aunt who had polio and said that is never happening to our kid,” Dye says.

They compromised. They would space apart their baby’s shots so he got no more than 2 per checkup. It would take much longer to get him vaccinated than the CDC recommends.

89,"THE first coronavirus vaccine has reportedly been completed by scientists at a genetic engineering company in Texas.

Scientists at Greffex Inc, which has a corporate headquarters in Houston and a laboratory in Aurora, Colorado, say they finished developing the vaccine this week.

Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updates

However, it could still be two years before the vaccine is available to use.

It now needs to be tested in animal experiments before human trials can begin.

The development comes as the death toll hit 2,247, and cases of the virus reached 76,727 across the world.

Greffex's company president and CEO John Price told the Houston Business Journal that they did not use a living or killed virus to form the vaccine - for safety reasons.

The coronavirus is so poorly understood, has spread so quickly and has killed enough people that scientists at Greffex did not want to risk exposure that could trigger the deadly illness known as COVID-19.

Instead, adenovirus-based vector vaccines, which are widely employed against various infectious diseases or cancers, were used.



 Adenoviruses are among the most common causes of viral respiratory infections, accounting for between two and five per cent of colds.

""The trick in making a vaccine is can you scale the vaccine that you’ve made to be able to make a certain number of doses, can you test that vaccine quickly and efficiently and then can you get it into patients,"" Price told local outlet KHOU 11.

""And that’s where we have an edge as well on the other companies that are out there.”

The vaccine is the product of an $18.9 million (£14.64 million) contract Greffex received in September 2019 from the National Institute of Health’s National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, aimed at fighting infectious threats, the Business Journal reported.

Coronavirus is an airborne virus, spread in a similar way to colds and the flu. Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches. It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes. In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus. But if a coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract (your windpipe and your lungs), it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems. There is no vaccine currently available for coronavirus. In 2003 an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than 8,000 people in 37 countries before it was brought under control, killing 800 of those worldwide.

If the vaccine wins government approval in the US, Greffex will give it away for free to the hardest-hit countries, Price said.

More than 2,100 people have died as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, with all but 11 of those deaths in mainland China.

Worldwide, more than 75,700 people have been infected.

In England, a total of nine people have tested positive for the virus, while more than 5,000 have tested negative.

The NHS confirmed that all but one of them have been discharged from hospital.

475,"Influenza vaccines, also known as flu shots or flu jabs, are vaccines that protect against infection by influenza viruses.[2] New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes.[2] While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza.[2][3] The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths.[4][5] Immunized workers who do catch the flu, return to work half a day sooner on average.[6] Vaccine effectiveness in those under two years old and those over 65 years old remains uncertain due to a lack of high quality research.[7][8] Vaccinating children may protect those around them.[2]

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend yearly vaccination for nearly all people over the age of six months, especially those at high risk.[2][9][10][11] The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommends yearly vaccination of high risk groups.[12] These groups include pregnant women, the elderly, children between six months and five years of age, those with certain health problems, and those who work in healthcare.[2][11]

The vaccines are generally safe.[2] Fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated.[2] Temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur as well.[2] In certain years, the vaccine has been linked to an increase in Guillain–Barré syndrome among older people at a rate of about one case per million doses.[2] Although most influenza vaccines are produced using eggs, they are still recommended for people who have severe egg allergies.[13] However, influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself.[2][13] The vaccine comes in inactive and weakened viral forms.[2] The live, weakened vaccine is generally not recommended in pregnant women, children less than two years old, adults older than 50, or people with a weakened immune system.[2] Depending on the type they can be injected into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or injected into the middle layer of the skin (intradermal).[2] The intradermal vaccine was not available during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons.[11][14][15][16]

Vaccination against influenza began in the 1930s with large-scale availability in the United States beginning in 1945.[17][18] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system.[19]

The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the flu vaccine as the best way to protect people against the flu and prevent its spread.[20] The flu vaccine can also reduce the severity of the flu if a person contracts a strain that the vaccine did not contain.[20] It takes about two weeks following vaccination for protective antibodies to form.[20]

A 2012 meta-analysis found that flu vaccination was effective 67 percent of the time; the populations that benefited the most were HIV-positive adults aged 18 to 55 (76 percent), healthy adults aged 18 to 46 (approximately 70 percent), and healthy children aged six to 24 months (66 percent).[21] The influenza vaccine also appear to protect against myocardial infarction with a benefit of 15 to 45%.[22]

A vaccine is assessed by its efficacy – the extent to which it reduces risk of disease under controlled conditions – and its effectiveness – the observed reduction in risk after the vaccine is put into use.[26] In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza.[6] Influenza vaccines generally show high efficacy, as measured by the antibody production in animal models or vaccinated people.[27] However, studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses.[28] However, in most years (16 of the 19 years before 2007), the flu vaccine strains have been a good match for the circulating strains,[29] and even a mismatched vaccine can often provide cross-protection.[20] The virus rapidly changes due to antigenic drift, a slight mutation in the virus that causes a new strain to arise.[30]

Repeated annual influenza vaccination generally offer consistent year-on-year protection against influenza.[31] There is however suggestive evidence that repeated vaccinations may cause a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for certain influenza subtypes; this has no relevance to current recommendations for yearly vaccinations but might influence future vaccination policy.[32][33] As of 2019 , the CDC recommends a yearly vaccine as most studies demonstrate overall effectiveness of annual influenza vaccination.[31]

Tom Jefferson, who has led Cochrane Collaboration reviews of flu vaccines, has called clinical evidence concerning flu vaccines ""rubbish"" and has therefore declared them to be ineffective; he has called for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, which most in the field hold as unethical. His views on the efficacy of flu vaccines are rejected by medical institutions including the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, and by key figures in the field like Anthony Fauci.[34]

Michael Osterholm, who led the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy 2012 review on flu vaccines, recommended getting the vaccine but criticized its promotion, saying, ""We have overpromoted and overhyped this vaccine...it does not protect as promoted. It's all a sales job: it's all public relations"".[35]

The CDC recommend that everyone except infants under the age of six months should receive the seasonal influenza vaccine.[9] Vaccination campaigns usually focus special attention on people who are at high risk of serious complications if they catch the flu, such as pregnant women, children under 59 months, the elderly, and people with chronic illnesses or weakened immune systems, as well as those to whom they are exposed, such as healthcare workers.[9][36]

As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant.[36][37]

In children, the vaccine appears to decrease the risk of influenza and possibly influenza-like illness.[38] In children under the age of two data is limited.[38] During the 2017–18 flu season, the CDC director indicated that 85 percent of the children who died ""likely will not have been vaccinated.""[39]

In the United States, as of January 2019 , the CDC recommend that children aged six through 35 months may receive either 0.25 milliliters or 0.5 milliliters per dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent.[40][41] There is no preference for one or the other dose volume of Fluzone Quadrivalent for that age group.[40] All persons 36 months of age and older should receive 0.5 milliliters per dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent.[40] As of October 2018 , Afluria Quadrivalent is licensed for children six months of age and older in the United States.[40][42] Children six months through 35 months of age should receive 0.25 milliliters for each dose of Afluria Quadrivalent.[40] All persons 36 months of age and older should receive 0.5 milliliters per dose of Afluria Quadrivalent.[40] As of February 2018 , Afluria Tetra is licensed for adults and children five years of age and older in Canada.[43]

In 2014, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) published a review of influenza vaccination in healthy 5–18-year-olds,[44] and in 2015, published a review of the use of pediatric Fluad in children 6–72 months of age.[45]

In unvaccinated adults, 16% get symptoms similar to the flu, while about 10% of vaccinated adults do.[6] Vaccination decreased confirmed cases of influenza from about 2.4% to 1.1%.[6] No effect on hospitalization was found.[6]

In working adults, a review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that vaccination resulted in a modest decrease in both influenza symptoms and working days lost, without affecting transmission or influenza-related complications.[6] In healthy working adults, influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, though such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons.[7]

In healthcare workers, a 2006 review found a net benefit.[46] Of the eighteen studies in this review, only two also assessed the relationship of patient mortality relative to staff influenza vaccine uptake; both found that higher rates of healthcare worker vaccination correlated with reduced patient deaths.[46] A 2014 review found benefits to patients when healthcare workers were immunized, as supported by moderate evidence[47] based in part on the observed reduction in all-cause deaths in patients whose healthcare workers were given immunization compared with comparison patients where the workers were not offered vaccine.[48]

Evidence for an effect in adults over 65 years old is unclear.[49] Systematic reviews examining both randomized controlled and case–control studies found a lack of high-quality evidence.[7][8] Reviews of case–control studies found effects against laboratory-confirmed influenza, pneumonia, and death among the community-dwelling elderly.[50][51]

The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, benefits least from the vaccine. There are multiple reasons behind this steep decline in vaccine efficacy, the most common of which are the declining immunological function and frailty associated with advanced age.[52] In a non-pandemic year, a person in the United States aged 50–64 is nearly ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than a younger person, and a person over age 65 is over ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than the 50–64 age group.[53]

There is a high-dose flu vaccine specifically formulated to provide a stronger immune response.[54] Available evidence indicates that vaccinating the elderly with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine.[55][56][57]

A flu vaccine containing an adjuvant was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015, for use by adults aged 65 years of age and older. The vaccine is marketed as Fluad in the U.S. and was first available in the 2016–2017 flu season. The vaccine contains the MF59C.1 adjuvant[58] which is an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene oil. It is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States.[59][60][61] It is not clear if there is a significant benefit for the elderly to use a flu vaccine containing the MF59C.1 adjuvant.[62][63][64] Per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines, Fluad can be used as an alternative to other influenza vaccines approved for people 65 years and older.[60]

Vaccinating healthcare workers who work with elderly people is recommended in many countries, with the goal of reducing influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population.[65][66][67] While there is no conclusive evidence from randomized clinical trials that vaccinating healthcare workers helps protect elderly people from influenza, there is tentative evidence of benefit.[68]

Fluad Quadrivalent was approved for use in the United States in February 2020[69] and Fluad Tetra was approved for use in the European Union in May 2020.[70]

As well as protecting mother and child from the effects of an influenza infection, the immunization of pregnant women tends to increase their chances of experiencing a successful full-term pregnancy.[71]

The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is protective in pregnant women infected with HIV.[72]

While side effects of the flu vaccine may occur, they are usually minor. The flu vaccine can cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. Furthermore, the common side effects and risks are mild and temporary when compared to the risks and severe health effects of the annual influenza epidemic.[20] Flu vaccination may lead to side effects such as a runny nose and a sore throat, which can last for up to several days.

Although Guillain–Barré syndrome had been feared as a complication of vaccination, the CDC states that most studies on modern influenza vaccines have seen no link with Guillain–Barré.[73][74] Infection with influenza virus itself increases both the risk of death (up to 1 in 10,000) and increases the risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome to a far higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approximately 10 times higher by 2009 estimates).[75][76]

Although one review gives an incidence of about one case of Guillain–Barré per million vaccinations,[77] a large study in China, covering close to 100 million doses of vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 ""swine"" flu found only eleven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, (0.1 per million doses) total incidence in persons vaccinated, actually lower than the normal rate of the disease in China, and no other notable side effects.[76][78]

Although most influenza vaccines are produced using egg-based techniques, influenza vaccines are nonetheless still recommended for people with egg allergies, even if severe.[13] Studies examining the safety of influenza vaccines in people with severe egg allergies found that anaphylaxis was very rare, occurring in 1.3 cases per million doses given.[13]

Monitoring for symptoms from vaccination is recommended in those with more severe symptoms.[79] A study of nearly 800 children with egg allergy, including over 250 with previous anaphylactic reactions, had zero systemic allergic reactions when given the live attenuated flu vaccine.[80][81]

Several studies have identified an increased incidence of narcolepsy among recipients of the pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine;[82] efforts to identify a mechanism for this suggest that narcolepsy is autoimmune, and that the ASO3-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine may mimic hypocretin, serving as a trigger.[83]

Some injection-based flu vaccines intended for adults in the United States contain thiomersal (also known as thimerosal), a mercury-based preservative.[84][85] Despite some controversy in the media,[86] the World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has concluded that there is no evidence of toxicity from thiomersal in vaccines and no reason on grounds of safety to change to more-expensive single-dose administration.[87]

Flu vaccines are available either as:
• a trivalent or quadrivalent intramuscular injection (IIV3, IIV4, or RIV4, that is, TIV or QIV), which contains the inactivated form of the virus
• a nasal spray of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV, Q/LAIV), which contains the live but attenuated (weakened) form of the virus.

TIV or QIV induce protection after injection (typically intramuscular, though subcutaneous and intradermal routes can also be protective)[88] based on an immune response to the antigens present on the inactivated virus, while cold-adapted LAIV works by establishing infection in the nasal passages.[89]

Various public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), recommend that yearly influenza vaccination be routinely offered, particularly to people at risk of complications of influenza and those individuals who live with or care for high-risk individuals, including:
• the elderly (UK recommendation is those aged 65 or above)
• people with chronic kidney diseases (such as the nephrotic syndrome)
• people who have had their spleen removed or whose spleen is not working properly
• people who are immunosuppressed (people with HIV, those receiving medications to suppress the immune system, and people on chemotherapy) and their household contacts
• people who live together in large numbers in an environment where influenza can spread rapidly, such as prisons, nursing homes, schools, and dormitories.[90]
• healthcare workers (both to prevent sickness and to prevent spread to patients)[91][92]
• women. However, a 2009 review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of trivalent influenza vaccine during the first trimester of pregnancy.[93] Influenza vaccination during flu season is part of recommendations for influenza vaccination of pregnant women in the United States.[94]

The flu vaccine is contraindicated for those under six months of age and those with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine.[9][95][13]

As of 2016 , the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for:[96][97][98][99][100]

Second priority (in no particular order):

The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), the group that advises the Public Health Agency of Canada, recommends that everyone over six months of age be encouraged to receive annual influenza vaccination, and that children between the age of six and 24 months, and their household contacts, should be considered a high priority for the flu vaccine.[101] Particularly:
• People at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization, including the morbidly obese, healthy pregnant women, children six to 59 months, the elderly, aboriginals, and people suffering from one of an itemized list of chronic health conditions
• People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk, including household contacts and healthcare workers

Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was not available in Canada for the 2019–2020 season.[101]

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends vaccinating the elderly as a priority, with a secondary priority people with chronic medical conditions and healthcare workers.[102]

The influenza vaccination strategy is generally that of protecting vulnerable people, rather than limiting influenza circulation or totally eliminating human influenza sickness. This is in contrast with the high herd immunity strategies for other infectious diseases such as polio and measles.[103] This is also due in part to the financial and logistics burden associated with the need of an annual injection.[104]

In the United States routine influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and over.[105][106][107] It takes up to two weeks after vaccination for sufficient antibodies to develop in the body.[107] The CDC recommends vaccination before the end of October, although it considers getting a vaccine in January or even later to be still beneficial.[20][107]

According to the CDC, the live attenuated virus (LAIV4) (which comes in the form of the nasal spray in the U.S.) should be avoided by:[11][108]
• Concomitant aspirin- or salicylate-containing therapy in children and adolescents
• Children aged 2 through 4 years who have received a diagnosis of asthma or whose parents or caregivers report that a healthcare provider has told them during the past 12 months that their child had wheezing or asthma or whose medical record indicates that a wheezing episode has occurred within the past 12 months
• Persons who are immunocompromised due to any cause (including but not limited to medications and HIV infection)
• Close contacts and caregivers of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment
• Persons who have received influenza antiviral medications within the previous 48 hours

Within its blanket recommendation for general vaccination in the United States, the CDC, which began recommending the influenza vaccine to healthcare workers in 1981, emphasizes to clinicians the special urgency of vaccination for members of certain vulnerable groups, and their caregivers:

The U.S. government requires hospitals to report worker vaccination rates. Some U.S. states and hundreds of U.S. hospitals require healthcare workers to either get vaccinations or wear masks during flu season. These requirements occasionally engender union lawsuits on narrow collective bargaining grounds, but proponents note that courts have generally endorsed forced vaccination laws affecting the general population during disease outbreaks.[115]

Vaccination against influenza is especially considered important for members of high-risk groups who would be likely to have complications from influenza, for example pregnant women[105][116] and children and teenagers from six months to 18 years of age who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;[11][90]
• In raising the upper age limit to 18 years, the aim is to reduce both the time children and parents lose from visits to pediatricians and missing school and the need for antibiotics for complications[117]
• An added benefit expected from the vaccination of children is a reduction in the number of influenza cases among parents and other household members, and of possible spread to the general community.[117]

The CDC indicated that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also called the nasal spray vaccine, was not recommended for the 2016–2017 flu season in the United States.[118]

Furthermore, the CDC recommends that healthcare personnel who care for severely immunocompromised persons receive injections (TIV or QIV) rather than LAIV.[119]

The Australian Government recommends seasonal flu vaccination for everyone over the age of six months.[120] Australia uses inactivated vaccines.[120] The flu vaccine is free for the following people:[121]
• children aged six months to five years
• Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged six months and over
• anyone over six months of age with medical conditions such as severe asthma, lung disease or heart disease, low immunity or diabetes that can lead to complications from influenza.

Uptake of flu vaccination, both seasonally and during pandemics, is often low.[123] Systematic reviews of pandemic flu vaccination uptake have identified several personal factors that may influence uptake, including gender (higher uptake in men), ethnicity (higher in people from ethnic minorities) and having a chronic illness.[124][125] Beliefs in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are also important.[123]

A number of measures have found to be useful to increase rates of vaccination in those over 60 years old including: patient reminders using leaflets and letters, postcard reminders, client outreach programs, vaccine home visits, group vaccinations, free vaccinations, physician payment, physician reminders and encouraging physician competition.[126]

Frontline healthcare workers are often recommended to get seasonal and any pandemic flu vaccination. For example, in the UK all healthcare workers involved in patient care are recommended to receive the seasonal flu vaccine, and were also recommended to be vaccinated against the H1N1/09 (later renamed A(H1N1)pdm09[note 1][127]) swine flu virus during the 2009 pandemic. However, uptake is often low.[92] During the 2009 pandemic, low uptake by healthcare workers was seen in countries including the UK,[92] Italy,[128] Greece,[129] and Hong Kong.[130]

In a 2010 survey of United States healthcare workers, 63.5% reported that they received the flu vaccine during the 2010–11 season, an increase from 61.9% reported the previous season. US Health professionals with direct patient contact had higher vaccination uptake, such as physicians and dentists (84.2%) and nurse practitioners (82.6%).[131][132][133]

The main reason to vaccinate healthcare workers is to prevent staff from spreading flu to their patients and to reduce staff absence at a time of high service demand, but the reasons healthcare workers state for their decisions to accept or decline vaccination may more often be to do with perceived personal benefits.[92]

In Victoria (Australia) public hospitals, rates of healthcare worker vaccination in 2005 ranged from 34% for non-clinical staff to 42% for laboratory staff. One of the reasons for rejecting vaccines was concern over adverse reactions; in one study, 31% of resident physicians at a teaching hospital incorrectly believed Australian vaccines could cause influenza.[134]

Flu vaccine is usually grown by vaccine manufacturers in fertilized chicken eggs.[135][136] In the Northern hemisphere, the manufacturing process begins following the announcement (typically in February) of the WHO recommended strains for the winter flu season.[135][137] Three strains (representing an H1N1, an H3N2, and a B strain) of flu are selected and chicken eggs are inoculated separately. These monovalent harvests are then combined to make the trivalent vaccine.[138]

As of November 2007 , both the conventional injection and the nasal spray are manufactured using chicken eggs.[136] The European Union also approved Optaflu, a vaccine produced by Novartis using vats of animal cells.[136] This technique is expected to be more scalable and avoid problems with eggs, such as allergic reactions and incompatibility with strains that affect avians like chickens.[136] Research continues into the idea of a ""universal"" influenza vaccine that would not require tailoring to a particular strain, but would be effective against a broad variety of influenza viruses.[139] However, no vaccine candidates had been announced by November 2007.[136]

A DNA-based vaccination, which is hoped to be even faster to manufacture, is, as of 2011 ,[needs update] in clinical trials, determining safety and efficacy.[140][141][142]

On November 20, 2012, Novartis received FDA approval for the first cell-culture vaccine.[143][144][145][146][144]

In a 2007 report, the global capacity of approximately 826 million seasonal influenza vaccine doses (inactivated and live) was double the production of 413 million doses. In an aggressive scenario of producing pandemic influenza vaccines by 2013, only 2.8 billion courses could be produced in a six-month time frame. If all high- and upper-middle-income countries sought vaccines for their entire populations in a pandemic, nearly 2 billion courses would be required. If China pursued this goal as well, more than 3 billion courses would be required to serve these populations.[147] Vaccine research and development is ongoing to identify novel vaccine approaches that could produce much greater quantities of vaccine at a price that is affordable to the global population.[citation needed]

Methods of vaccine generation that bypass the need for eggs include the construction of influenza virus-like particles (VLP). VLP resemble viruses, but there is no need for inactivation, as they do not include viral coding elements, but merely present antigens in a similar manner to a virion. Some methods of producing VLP include cultures of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells and plant-based vaccine production (e.g., production in Nicotiana benthamiana). There is evidence that some VLPs elicit antibodies that recognize a broader panel of antigenically distinct viral isolates compared to other vaccines in the hemagglutination-inhibition assay (HIA).[148]

Influenza vaccines are produced in pathogen-free eggs that are 11 to 12 days old.[149] The top of the egg is disinfected by wiping it with alcohol and then the egg is candled to identify a non-veinous area in the allantoic cavity where a small hole is poked to serve as a pressure release.[150] A second hole is made at the top of the egg, where the influenza virus is injected in the allantoic cavity, past the chorioallantoic membrane. The two holes are then sealed with melted paraffin and the inoculated eggs are incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees Celsius.[149] During incubation time, the virus replicates and newly replicated viruses are released into the allantoic fluid [151]

After the 48-hour incubation period, the top of the egg is cracked and the 10 milliliters of allantoic fluid is removed, from which about 15 micrograms of the flu vaccine can be obtained. At this point, the viruses have been weakened or killed and the viral antigen is purified and placed inside vials, syringes, or nasal sprayers.[151] Done on a large-scale, this method is used to produce the flu vaccine for the human population.

In 2013, the recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok, was approved for use in the United States.[152][153][154][155]

Each year, three strains are chosen for selection in that year's flu vaccination by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.[156] The chosen strains are the H1N1, H3N2, and Type-B strains thought most likely to cause significant human suffering in the coming season. Starting with the 2012–2013 Northern Hemisphere influenza season (coincident with the approval of quadrivalent influenza vaccines), the WHO has also recommended a 2nd B-strain for use in quadrivalent vaccines. The World Health Organization (WHO) coordinates the contents of the vaccine each year to contain the most likely strains of the virus to attack the next year.

The Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System's selection of viruses for the vaccine manufacturing process is based on its best estimate of which strains will predominate the next year, amounting in the end to well-informed but fallible guesswork.[159]

Formal WHO recommendations were first issued in 1973. Beginning in 1999 there have been two recommendations per year: one for the northern hemisphere and the other for the southern hemisphere.[160]

Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine are listed in a separate article. Recent WHO seasonal influenza vaccine composition recommendations:

The composition of trivalent virus vaccines for use in the 2017–2018 Northern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on August 25, 2017[161] was:

In addition to these components, quadrivalent vaccines will also include a B/Phuket/3073/2013–like virus (Yamagata lineage).

In California, some emergency systems were strained by a spike in H3N2 flu cases. In addition, some areas experienced local shortages of oseltamivir.[163] The severity of the flu season seemed somewhat comparable to the 2009–10 swine flu outbreak. A February 2018 CDC interim report estimated the vaccine effectiveness to be 25% against H3N2, 67% against H1N1, and 42% against influenza B.[164][165]

The composition of virus vaccines for use in the 2018 Southern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the World Health Organization on September 28, 2017 was:[166]

The WHO recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses should contain the above three viruses and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.[167][166]

The composition of virus vaccines for use in the 2018–2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the World Health Organization on February 22, 2018 was:[168][169]

The WHO recommended that trivalent vaccines use as their influenza B virus a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage.[170][168] A February 2019, CDC interim report estimated the vaccine effectiveness to be approximately 47% against the 2018–2019 flu strains.[24]

The composition of virus vaccines for use in the United States for the 2018–2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the Food and Drug Administration on March 1, 2018, was:[171]

The committee also recommended that quadrivalent influenza vaccines contain the above three strains and the following additional B strain:[171]

The composition of virus vaccines for use in the 2019 Southern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the World Health Organization in September 2018 was:[172]

The WHO recommended that trivalent vaccines use as their influenza B virus a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage.[173]

The composition of virus vaccines for use in the 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the World Health Organization on March 21, 2019 was:

The WHO recommended that trivalent vaccines use as their influenza B virus a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage.[175]

The composition of virus vaccines for use in the United States for the 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the Food and Drug Administration on March 22, 2019, was:[176][177][178]

The committee also recommended that quadrivalent influenza vaccines contain the above three strains and the following additional B strain:[176]

The composition of virus vaccines for use in the European Union for the 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the European Medicines Agency on May 15, 2019, was:[179]

 Trivalent vaccines should contain:

For vaccine manufacturers considering the use of a B/Yamagata/16/88 virus lineage vaccine virus in quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses, a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus in addition to the strains mentioned above is considered appropriate.[179]

The composition of virus vaccines for use in the 2020 Southern Hemisphere influenza season influenza season recommended by the World Health Organization in September 2019 was:[180]

The WHO recommended that trivalent vaccines use as their influenza B virus a B/Washington/02/2019-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus.[180]

Vaccines are used in both humans and nonhumans. Human vaccine is meant unless specifically identified as a veterinary, poultry or livestock vaccine.

In the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, ""Physicians tried everything they knew, everything they had ever heard of, from the ancient art of bleeding patients, to administering oxygen, to developing new vaccines and serums (chiefly against what we now call Hemophilus influenzae – a name derived from the fact that it was originally considered the etiological agent – and several types of pneumococci). Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success.""[181]

In 1931, viral growth in embryonated hens' eggs was reported by Ernest William Goodpasture and colleagues at Vanderbilt University. The work was extended to growth of influenza virus by several workers, including Thomas Francis, Jonas Salk, Wilson Smith and Macfarlane Burnet, leading to the first experimental influenza vaccines.[182] In the 1940s, the US military developed the first approved inactivated vaccines for influenza, which were used in the Second World War.[183] Hen's eggs continued to be used to produce virus used in influenza vaccines, but manufacturers made improvements in the purity of the virus by developing improved processes to remove egg proteins and to reduce systemic reactivity of the vaccine.[184] In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved influenza vaccines made by growing virus in cell cultures[185][144][186] and influenza vaccines made from recombinant proteins[152] have been approved, with plant-based influenza vaccines being tested[when?] in clinical trials.[187]

According to the CDC: ""Influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe complications. [...] Vaccination is associated with reductions in influenza-related respiratory illness and physician visits among all age groups, hospitalization and death among persons at high risk, otitis media among children, and work absenteeism among adults. Although influenza vaccination levels increased substantially during the 1990s, further improvements in vaccine coverage levels are needed"".[188]

The egg-based technology (still in use as of 2019 ) for producing influenza vaccine was created in the 1950s.[189] In the U.S. swine flu scare of 1976, President Gerald Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic. The vaccination program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. Meanwhile, maximum military containment efforts succeeded unexpectedly in confining the new strain to the single army base where it had originated. On that base, a number of soldiers fell severely ill, but only one died. The program was canceled after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of twenty-five over normal annual levels as well as 400 excess hospitalizations, both from Guillain–Barré syndrome, were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, illustrating that the vaccine itself is not free of risks. The result has been cited to stoke lingering doubts about vaccination.[190] In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976.[191]

A quadrivalent flu vaccine administered by nasal mist was approved by the FDA in March 2012.[192][193] Fluarix Quadrivalent was approved by the FDA in December 2012.[194]

In 2014, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) published a review of quadrivalent influenza vaccines.[195]

Starting with the 2018-2019 influenza season most of the regular-dose egg-based flu shots and all of the recombinant and cell-grown flu vaccines in the United States are quadrivalent.[196] In the 2019–2020 influenza season all regular-dose flu shots and all recombinant influenza vaccine in the United States are quadrivalent.[40]

In November 2019, the FDA approved Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent for use in the United States starting with the 2020-2021 influenza season.[197][198]

The cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings.[199] In the elderly (aged over 65 years) the majority of published studies have found that vaccination is cost saving, with the cost savings associated with influenza vaccination (e.g. prevented healthcare visits) outweighing the cost of vaccination.[200] In older adults (aged 50–64 years), several published studies have found that influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective, however the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations.[201] The uncertainty in influenza cost-effectiveness models can partially be explained by the complexities involved in estimating the disease burden,[202] as well as the seasonal variability in the circulating strains and the match of the vaccine.[203][204] In healthy working adults (aged 18–49 years), a 2012 review found that vaccination was generally not cost-saving, with the suitability for funding being dependent on the willingness to pay to obtain the associated health benefits.[205] In children, the majority of studies have found that influenza vaccination was cost-effective, however many of the studies included (indirect) productivity gains, which may not be given the same weight in all settings.[206] Several studies have attempted to predict the cost-effectiveness of interventions (including prepandemic vaccination) to help protect against a future pandemic, however estimating the cost-effectiveness has been complicated by uncertainty as to the severity of a potential future pandemic and the efficacy of measures against it.[207]

Influenza research includes molecular virology, molecular evolution, pathogenesis, host immune responses, genomics, and epidemiology. These help in developing influenza countermeasures such as vaccines, therapies and diagnostic tools. Improved influenza countermeasures require basic research on how viruses enter cells, replicate, mutate, evolve into new strains and induce an immune response. The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project is creating a library of influenza sequences[208] that will help researchers' understanding of what makes one strain more lethal than another, what genetic determinants most affect immunogenicity, and how the virus evolves over time. Solutions to limitations in current[when?] vaccine methods are being[when?] researched.

A different approach uses Internet content to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign. More specifically, researchers have used data from Twitter and Microsoft's Bing search engine, and proposed a statistical framework which, after a series of operations, maps this information to estimates of the influenza-like illness reduction percentage in areas where vaccinations have been performed. The method has been used to quantify the impact of two flu vaccination programmes in England (2013/14 and 2014/15), where school-age children were administered a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Notably, the impact estimates were in accordance with estimations from Public Health England based on traditional syndromic surveillance endpoints.[209][210]

The rapid development, production, and distribution of pandemic influenza vaccines could potentially save millions of lives during an influenza pandemic. Due to the short time frame between identification of a pandemic strain and need for vaccination, researchers are looking at novel technologies for vaccine production that could provide better ""real-time"" access and be produced more affordably, thereby increasing access for people living in low- and moderate-income countries, where an influenza pandemic may likely originate, such as live attenuated (egg-based or cell-based) technology and recombinant technologies (proteins and virus-like particles).[211] As of July 2009 , more than 70 known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines.[212] In September 2009, the FDA approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (the 2009 pandemic strain), and expected the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month.[213]

In January 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Audenz as a vaccine for the H5N1 flu virus.[214] Audenz is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine. Audenz is approved for use in persons six months of age and older at increased risk of exposure to the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine.[215]

A ""universal vaccine"" that would not have to be designed and made for each flu season in each hemisphere would be useful, in order to stabilize the supply and to ensure against error in the design or escape of the circulating strains by mutation.[139] Such a vaccine has been the subject of research for decades.[216]

One promising approach is using broadly neutralizing antibodies that unlike the annual seasonal vaccines used over the last several decades which provoke the body to generate an immune response, instead provide a component of the immune response itself. The first neutralizing antibodies were identified in 1993, via experimentation;[217] with time researchers understood that the flu neutralizing antibodies were binding to the stalk of the Hemagglutinin protein; later researchers identified antibodies that could bind to the head of those proteins. Later yet, researchers identified the highly conserved M2 proton channel as a potential target for broadly neutralizing antibodies.[216][218]

The challenges for researchers have been identifying single antibodies that could neutralize many subtypes of the virus, so that they could be useful in any season, and that target conserved domains that are resistant to antigenic drift.[216]

Another approach has been taking the conserved domains identified from these projects, and delivering groups of these antigens to provoke an immune response; various approaches with different antigens, presented different ways (as fusion proteins, mounted on virus-like particles, on non-pathogenic viruses, as DNA, and others), are under development.[218][219][220]

Efforts have also been undertaken to develop universal vaccines that specifically activate a T-cell response, based on clinical data showing that people with a strong, early T-cell response have better outcomes when infected with influenza and because T-cells respond to conserved epitopes. The challenge for developers is that these epitopes are on internal protein domains that are only mildly immunogenic.[218]

Along with the rest of the vaccine field, people working on universal vaccines have been experimenting with vaccine adjuvants to improve the ability of their vaccines to create a sufficiently powerful and enduring immune response.[218][221]

There have been some clinical trials of the M-001[222][223][139][224][225] and H1ssF_3928 universal influenza vaccine candidates. As of May of 2020, 6 of 7 M-001 trials are completed. One of the 7 M-001 trials has results. None of the BiondVax-sponsored M-001 trials have results.[139][226][227]

As of 2019, an oral flu vaccine was in clinical research.[228] The oral vaccine candidate is based on an adenovirus type 5 vector modified to remove genes needed for replication, with an added gene that expresses a small double-stranded RNA hairpin molecule as an adjuvant.[229] In 2020, a phase II human trial of the pill form of the vaccine showed that it was well tolerated and provided similar immunity to a licensed injectable vaccine.[230]

Veterinary influenza vaccination aims to achieve the following four objectives:[231]

Horses with horse flu can run a fever, have a dry hacking cough, have a runny nose, and become depressed and reluctant to eat or drink for several days but usually recover in two to three weeks. ""Vaccination schedules generally require a primary course of two doses, 3–6 weeks apart, followed by boosters at 6–12 month intervals. It is generally recognized that in many cases such schedules may not maintain protective levels of antibody and more frequent administration is advised in high-risk situations.""[232]

It is a common requirement at shows in the United Kingdom that horses be vaccinated against equine flu and a vaccination card must be produced; the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) requires vaccination every six months.[233][234]

Poultry vaccines for bird flu are made inexpensively and are not filtered and purified like human vaccines to remove bits of bacteria or other viruses. They usually contain whole virus, not just hemagglutinin as in most human flu vaccines. Another difference between human and poultry vaccines is that poultry vaccines are adjuvated with mineral oil, which induces a strong immune reaction but can cause inflammation and abscesses. ""Chicken vaccinators who have accidentally jabbed themselves have developed painful swollen fingers or even lost thumbs, doctors said. Effectiveness may also be limited. Chicken vaccines are often only vaguely similar to circulating flu strains – some contain an H5N2 strain isolated in Mexico years ago. 'With a chicken, if you use a vaccine that's only 85 percent related, you'll get protection,' Dr. Cardona said. 'In humans, you can get a single point mutation, and a vaccine that's 99.99 percent related won't protect you.' And they are weaker [than human vaccines]. 'Chickens are smaller and you only need to protect them for six weeks, because that's how long they live till you eat them,' said Dr. John J. Treanor, a vaccine expert at the University of Rochester. Human seasonal flu vaccines contain about 45 micrograms of antigen, while an experimental A(H5N1) vaccine contains 180. Chicken vaccines may contain less than one microgram. 'You have to be careful about extrapolating data from poultry to humans,' warned Dr. David E. Swayne, director of the agriculture department's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory. 'Birds are more closely related to dinosaurs.'""[235]

Researchers, led by Nicholas Savill of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, used mathematical models to simulate the spread of H5N1 and concluded that ""at least 95 percent of birds need to be protected to prevent the virus spreading silently. In practice, it is difficult to protect more than 90 percent of a flock; protection levels achieved by a vaccine are usually much lower than this.""[236] The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has issued recommendations on the prevention and control of avian influenza in poultry, including the use of vaccination.[237]

A filtered and purified Influenza A vaccine for humans is being developed[when?] and many countries have recommended it be stockpiled so if an Avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans, the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid loss of life. Avian influenza is sometimes called avian flu, and commonly bird flu.[238]

Swine influenza vaccines are extensively used in pig farming in Europe and North America. Most swine flu vaccines include an H1N1 and an H3N2 strain.

Swine influenza has been recognized as a major problem since the outbreak in 1976. Evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the problem when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection. Customised (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated, are made and used in the more difficult cases.[239] The vaccine manufacturer Novartis claims that the H3N2 strain (first identified in 1998) has brought major losses to pig farmers. Abortion storms are a common sign and sows stop eating for a few days and run a high fever. The mortality rate can be as high as 15 percent.[240]

In 2004, influenza A virus subtype H3N8 was discovered to cause canine influenza. Because of the lack of previous exposure to this virus, dogs have no natural immunity to this virus. However, a vaccine was found in 2004.[241]

227,"In 1796, English physician Edward Jenner had a hunch. As hundreds of thousands around him succumbed to the blistering agony of smallpox, Jenner’s eye was on the rosy, unblemished complexion of Sarah Nelmes, a local milkmaid. Her skin bore none of the oozing lesions that signaled almost certain death for a third of smallpox sufferers—save for her hands, busily milking a cow named Blossom.

The locals called the unsightly affliction “cowpox.” But apart from a smattering of welts, Sarah and her fellow milkmaids were remarkably free of disease. To Jenner, this wasn’t a coincidence. Acting on little more than sparse observations, Jenner decided to extract a small sample of Sarah’s pus and inject it into the arm of a young boy named James Phipps. To everyone’s amazement—including Jenner’s—when Jenner stuck Phipps with a second needle, this time sporting a hefty dose of smallpox, Phipps remained healthy. Against all odds, the risky treatment had granted the child miraculous immunity.

This revolutionary (and wildly unethical) experiment catapulted the world into the era of what would come to be called “vaccination,” a word whose etymology contains a reverent nod to the Latin vacca, for “cow.” Smallpox would become the first disease officially conquered by human medicine.

“[Smallpox eradication] shows what we can really achieve when we have the proper tools to fight a disease,” says Sabrina Sholts, a curator of anthropology at the National Museum of Natural History, where she developed the infectious-disease-centric “Outbreak” exhibit. “But knowing about the disease also shows us how many people were killed… and we realize there’s no reason it couldn’t happen again.”

Not only is there the potential for smallpox (or at the very least, something very similar) to resurge, but unbeknownst to most, the very origins of this revolutionary vaccine are in question. For decades, scientists have thought the legend of cowpox as the savior—first, of James Phipps, then, of the world—may very well be wrong. That cryptic crack in medical history could leave humanity vulnerable to a future outbreak—however unlikely it may be.

By the end of the 18th century, smallpox, caused by variola virus, was a worldwide terror, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives each year. The disease was an ancient one, plaguing populations at least as far back as the third century B.C., and infected indiscriminately, sparing neither rich nor poor and felling men, women and children alike.

So, when Jenner’s “vaccine” (really just pus teeming with virus) hit the scene, it literally went viral. By 1813, it was widely accessible in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Because poxviruses like smallpox are most easily passed from animal to animal, scientists first created new reserves of the vaccine by collecting pus from infected livestock. Each time stocks ran low, scientists rounded up a fresh herd of naturally infected animals and consolidated their secretions.

“The vaccine evolved,” says Inger Damon, who leads the poxvirus and rabies branch at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “The way it was propagated—either on the sides of cows or in rabbits—changed and introduced related viruses into the pool… [so] a swarm of viruses was used in various vaccines.”

In 1939, a researcher at the University of Liverpool named Allan Watt Downie became curious about how the smallpox vaccine might have changed over time. Nowadays, vaccines are meticulously produced en masse and most (including some modern versions of smallpox vaccine) contain severely weakened versions of infectious microbes or small, incomplete bits of the pathogens—the bare minimum required to jolt the immune system into action. This circumvents the possibility of causing a real infection or spreading a new agent of disease within the human population. But the early smallpox vaccine was based on a virus fully capable of causing disease—one less severe than smallpox, but disease all the same. And active viruses are still subject to the pressures of evolution.

When Downie compared the viral contents of a smallpox vaccine, still known to this day as a lineage called “vaccinia virus,” to a sample of cowpox isolated directly from cattle, he was surprised to find that they were different. Related, yes—but certainly not identical.

This, unfortunately, opened quite the can of worms. The two samples were divergent enough that it seemed highly improbable that vaccinia, the current smallpox vaccine, was descended from cowpox. This left Downie and his colleagues with an unsettling question: What on earth had they been injecting into the arms of millions of people for the past 150 years?

Sleuthing through historical records led some scientists to speculate that another virus called horsepox, known to infect both horses and cows, may have been vaccinia virus’ ancestor. Even Jenner himself mused about the equine origins of his miracle drug in his original publication, speculating that the most protective route of vaccine transmission might be horse to cow to human.

As far as science had progressed, the field of virology did not yet have the right set of tools to fully suss out the answers. In the meantime, vaccinia—despite its murky ancestry—had been working miracles. And so, with a wary shrug, scientists put an exceptionally large pin in the mysterious origins of the millennium’s medical marvel and moved on. Soon, it seemed humanity, with the help of vaccinia, had won its centuries-long battle with smallpox. In May of 1980, the World Health Organization triumphantly proclaimed, “Smallpox is dead.”

The world’s memory is brief. As smallpox disappeared from hospital wards, so did it from the minds of the public. Eventually, technology advanced to the point where it was finally feasible to reopen medicine’s greatest cold case and discover the true roots of the smallpox vaccine. But why not let sleeping pox lie? The scourge of smallpox had been wiped from the face of the earth—whatever was in that vaccine, be it derived of cow or horse or confetti—did it even matter?

But the era of smallpox is far from over. Although smallpox is technically eradicated, at least two laboratories—one in Russia and one at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia—still harbor samples of variola virus. And concerns of a future outbreak go far beyond a hapless laboratory accident: Modern gene-editing techniques have made it possible to build a lethal lookalike from scratch. Now more than ever, the threat of bioterrorism looms large.

Since routine vaccination efforts ceased nearly four decades ago, the vast majority of the modern global population would be completely vulnerable to an unexpected pandemic. Anywhere from 30 to 88 percent of people exposed to the virus can be infected, and nearly a third of those who contract the disease will die. It was only in July of 2018 that the FDA approved the first drug to treat smallpox. Vaccination remains the only other tool at our disposal—and if an outbreak were to occur, millions of Americans, including pregnant women and people with HIV or eczema, would be precluded from vaccination.

Creating a new or improved vaccine could help, but working with the world’s limited stores of smallpox (like those at the CDC or in Russia) is both impractical and extremely dangerous. Tooling instead with a less virulent close relative could help researchers safely and effectively hit pay dirt. So if horsepox was the virus that kicked off vaccination in the 18th century, modern research should trend equine—but first, the world needs proof.

Some researchers have taken steps in that direction. In the 1970s, a small handful of scientists decided to once again probe the relationship between the vaccinia vaccine strain and horsepox. One group was able to show an encouraging degree of relatedness between horsepox and an old Brazilian vaccine strain, supposedly sourced from France in the mid-1800s. But this finding was but a blip on the scientific radar, and little progress was made in the decades that followed.

Recent advances in technology have reinvigorated the investigation, however. Scientists like Damon at the CDC, along with an independent team led by virologist Jose Esparza at the University of Maryland, have begun collecting old smallpox vaccines from museums and laboratories from around the world to analyze the genetic sequences contained within. With viral genomes, researchers may be able to trace vaccine ancestry backwards in time and eventually pinpoint the source—or likely, sources—of these protective artifacts.

The work is ongoing, says Esparza, but he is confident that horsepox entered the mix at some point. His team has compiled 15 vaccine samples and counting, most from the early 1900s, and recently published a genetic analysis of a 1902 vaccine that bears a striking resemblance to horsepox. The resemblance is imperfect, says Esparza, but together, these findings provide strong evidence that horsepox played a role in smallpox vaccine production.

Esparza calls these new findings “a lesson in humility.” Jenner, for all his genius, was likely shooting in the dark. (Although it's possible he had a few more hints than the oft-told story of his discovery implies.) He couldn’t possibly have understood the intricacies of vaccination as we do today—but often, Esparza says, we must develop solutions without knowing every scientific detail. Now, it’s time to play catch-up: Technology finally has the power to find the answers to a medical problem that only claims to be solved.

“There’s nothing more interesting to me, as a scientist, than solving a problem,” Esparza says. “I just want to find the truth.”

Importantly, Esparza adds, even if the world doesn’t have much to fear from smallpox itself, plenty of other viruses in the “pox” family could still be cause for concern for humans and wildlife alike. Many animals have their own flavor of poxvirus, including monkeys, pigs and even mollusks. Several—though not all—of these diseases have been known to be zoonotic, hopping from wildlife into human populations. Protecting both animals and humans requires an intimate knowledge of the viruses in question. According to Esparza, better understanding the smallpox vaccine, down to its murky four-legged roots, may be one of our most powerful tools to forestall an entire family of known diseases.

What’s more, it’s unlikely humans are done encountering all the poxviruses that may trouble us in the future. “Some people estimate we’ve discovered less than 1 percent of the existing viruses in nature,” says Esparza. “Smallpox is eradicated. But the world is full of viruses waiting to be discovered.”

In the meantime, the jury is still out on the relative contributions of horses, cows and their respective poxviruses to the eradication of smallpox—but horsepox was certainly, well, the dark horse of this race. As the debate continues, though, should we start making the verbal switch from “vaccines” to “equines”? Not just yet, says Damon. Cows and milkmaids, regardless of the exact strain they carried, were still an integral piece of Jenner’s discovery. Blossom’s legacy remains intact—for now.",mainstream
634,"Yellow fever is a serious infection spread by mosquitoes. It's found in parts of Africa, South America, Central America and Trinidad in the Caribbean. There's a vaccine that can stop you getting yellow fever if you're travelling to an area where the infection is found.

The yellow fever vaccine is recommended if you're travelling to:
• an area where yellow fever is found
• a country that requires you to have a certificate proving you've been vaccinated against yellow fever You need to have the vaccine at least 10 days before travelling to give it enough time to work. Your certificate will only be valid after this time. If you or your child has had the MMR vaccine, you or they ideally need to wait at least 4 weeks before having the yellow fever vaccine. The vaccine and certificate are only available from registered yellow fever vaccination centres. The jab is not available for free on the NHS so you'll have to pay for it. It typically costs around £60 to £85. The vaccine provides lifelong protection for most travellers, so you will not normally need a booster dose. Read more about the yellow fever vaccine.
• parts of sub-Saharan Africa (the area below the Sahara desert) It is not found in the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand or the Pacific Islands. To find out if yellow fever is a risk where you're travelling to, or if the country you're visiting requires a vaccination certificate, see:
• TravelHealthPro: country information – click on the vaccine recommendation tab for your destination
• TravelHealthPro: maps of where yellow fever vaccine is recommended

Yellow fever is a virus spread by mosquito bites. You cannot get it from close contact with someone who has it. The mosquitoes that spread the infection are found in towns, cities and rural areas. They mainly bite during the day. Mosquitoes can also spread other serious illnesses, such as malaria and dengue. If you're travelling to an area where yellow fever is found, try to avoid being bitten, even if you have been vaccinated. You can do this by using mosquito nets, wearing clothes that cover your arms and legs, and using insect repellent containing 30% to 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide). Read more about how to prevent insect bites.

The first symptoms of yellow fever usually develop 3 to 6 days after being infected.
• your eyes being sensitive to light Up to 1 in 4 people go on to get more serious symptoms, such as:
• yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
• bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or ears

When to get medical help See a doctor straight away if you get symptoms of yellow fever while travelling in an area where the infection is found. If you get symptoms after recently returning from one of these areas, contact a GP or NHS 111 for advice as soon as possible. Tell them exactly where you have been travelling, whether you think you have been bitten by a mosquito, and what symptoms you have. You may need to have a blood test to check for the infection.",mainstream

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said Internet companies like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have a ‘Duty of care’ and if they won’t censor such material, then legislation would.

Disinformation campaigns from the controversial anti-vax movement have plagued social media firms in recent years, with Facebook among those blamed for helping fuel the misguided belief in scientifically disproven claims that vaccinations are harmful and can cause autism.

The issue has become so severe that several vaccine-preventable diseases like measles have seen outbreaks in areas where they were previously almost eliminated.

The Independent bizarrely goes onto use Charlie Sheen as an example of high profile faces of the anti-vaccine movement, which is a ridiculous example to use, but of course they were never going to use someone like Del Bigtree who provides factual information on the problems surrounding Vaccines.

But, everyone should agree on this point:

No government can force anyone who has reached legal adulthood to be vaccinated for the coronavirus [we are protected by the Nuremberg Code].

Equally, no government can vaccinate minors for the coronavirus against the will of their parents or guardians.

Please SIGN this urgent petition which urges policymakers at every level of government to reject calls for mandatory coronavirus vaccination.

Fear of a disease – which we know very little about, relative to other similar diseases – must not lead to knee-jerk reactions regarding public health, nor can it justify supporting the hidden agenda of governmental as well as non-governmental bodies that have apparent conflicts of interest in plans to restrict personal freedoms.

The so-called “public health experts” have gotten it wrong many times during the current crisis. We should not, therefore, allow their opinions to rush decision-makers into policies regarding vaccination.

And, while some people, like Bill Gates, may have a lot of money, his opinion and that of his NGO (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) – namely, that life will not return to normal till people are widely vaccinated – should not be permitted to influence policy decisions on a coronavirus vaccination program.

Finally, we must also not allow the rush by pharmaceutical companies to produce a new coronavirus vaccine to, itself, become an imperative for vaccination.

Unwitting citizens must not be used as guinea pigs for New World Order ideologues, or Big Pharma, in pursuit of a vaccine (and, profits) which may not even protect against future mutated strains of the coronavirus.

And it goes without saying that the production of vaccines using aborted babies for cell replication is a total non-starter, as the technique is gravely immoral.

However, if after sufficient study of the issue, a person who has reached the age of majority wishes to be vaccinated with a morally produced vaccine, along with his children, that is his business.

But we cannot and will not permit the government to make that decision for us.

219,"The meningococcal vaccine protects you from four types of bacteria that cause meningococcal disease. This illness can cause meningitis, an infection of the lining around the brain or spinal cord. It can also cause a blood infection (meningococcal bacteremia), pneumonia, and other problems.

As many as 20% of those who survive may have lasting problems such as hearing loss, brain damage, seizures, or loss of limbs.

Because teens and young adults are at increased risk for meningitis, all adolescents should be vaccinated against meningitis.

For adults at risk, the vaccine is important.

You can catch meningococcal infection through close contact with someone who has the bacteria in his or her throat or nose. Early symptoms of both meningitis and blood infection can be confused with the flu or a cold, but symptoms can rapidly become more severe and may include:

491,"Drugs are usually administered to patients, i.e., ill/injured subjects in need of treatment regardless of the severity of their health problems. Many drugs can coexist in the same therapeutic class because each of them may have different effects on specific sub-groups of patients.

In contrast, the same vaccines are administered to otherwise healthy individuals, to prevent the same diseases. Wherever high coverage rates are achieved, unvaccinated subjects may benefit too, by reducing the risk of transmission and circulation of pathogens due to the so called ‘herd immunity’ [3]. Therefore, the social benefits of vaccines can exceed the private ones [4]. Conversely, because vaccines can cause a (small) risk of serious adverse effects in healthy individuals—often infants and children—not suffering the targeted diseases, they may be more open to criticism than drugs [4]. This can favor campaigning against them by the so-called ‘anti-vax’ movements, especially in highly developed countries which have not experienced pandemics for decades before COVID-19.

Patents are crucial for maximizing financial returns on drugs’ research investments, even after the first invention, which is part of a harsh debate in the pharmaceutical literature [5]. To limit the turnover of off-patent medicines, pharmaceutical companies often recur to secondary patenting for dramatically prolonging protection (the so called ‘ever greening’ strategies). Secondary patents on drugs are usually applied to new indications and ‘me-too’ drugs. Besides patents on products, complex biological drugs, such as the recent monoclonal antibodies (mABs) can be further protected on production phases that affect their final mechanism [6].

Differently, patents are less relevant for vaccines, mainly protecting manufacturing processes rather than antigens [7]. In fact, patents on products cannot prevent other companies from using different strains to supply competing vaccines [4]. Because vaccines are all biological agents to date—awaiting future RNA/DNA synthetic vaccines—their outcomes can vary a lot on account of the biological variability in raw materials and the steps involved in purification processes [8]; thus, patents on processes may help prolong their life cycles.

Research and promotion have always been the major cost items for developing and marketing drugs, whereas manufacturing costs hardly ever account for a substantial proportion of total costs, with the last generation of sky-high priced mABs no exception [9]. In general, it is difficult to estimate single cost items per product in a research-oriented industry-like pharmaceuticals.

Conversely, manufacturing costs are the major ones for vaccines, which can have batch-to-batch variability and substantial changes in manufacturing processes requiring extensive analyses to show bioequivalence even after marketing approval [8]. Vaccines imply large-scale productions, which have traditionally discouraged the launch of off-patent and ‘me too’ vaccines [4]. High fixed manufacturing costs are diluted over many doses and are quite easy to post to each vaccine given their limited number. Recent trends have been to launch combination vaccines, including more than one antigen for reducing administration processes and new adjuvants for potentiating immune responses and/or sparing doses [10].

General practitioners (GPs) are traditionally the major prescribers of drugs. Although the prescription of a growing number of new and expensive agents (e.g., mABs) may now be limited to the hospital settings in many European countries [11], most drugs are still prescribed by GPs and thus dispensed through community pharmacies.

Somewhat differently, the delivery of vaccines is more uneven throughout European countries, varying a lot according to the type of health care systems—e.g., Beveridge-type like in Italy and the UK, or Bismarck-type such as in France and Germany—and the national framework within the same type. For instance, in Italy, the vaccines recommended for children are administered in local health districts by public health professionals and those for adults by GPs in their cabinets [12], whereas in the UK all vaccines are mainly provided by general practices. Because most vaccines are still injectable, a common issue is that of storage and preparation [10]. Hence, beyond reducing injection overcrowding in health facilities, combo vaccines help contain storage and shipping costs [13].

In a typical ‘market failure’ situation like pharmaceuticals, physicians (working as the patient’s agent) fill the information gap of patients in medicine and take on their behalf the final decisions about how many and which drugs to prescribe among those available [14]. Hence, as prescribers, physicians are conventionally the major marketing target of pharmaceutical companies and aggressive strategies may raise financial conflicts of interest [15], eventually leading to drug overconsumption and bribery.

In contrast, vaccines do not normally require intensive promotion by industry. Campaigns to achieve high rates of coverage are mainly a task of health authorities, with manufacturers obviously interested in backing them up. Activities may consist of specific trainings for healthcare professionals and awareness campaigns for patients, except where vaccinations are mandatory, which is hardly ever the case in European countries nowadays [12]. Final results are substantially affected by public perception of vaccines values [1], with single physicians playing an important role in influencing vaccine hesitant families [16].

Prices of new drugs have dramatically increased all over Europe in the last decade, making pharmaceutical expenditure somewhat unsustainable even in the (wealthier) Western countries. The most recent and ambitious price schemes (e.g., value-based pricing and outcome-based agreements) have shown intrinsic limits despite their scientific attractiveness [17], whereas sound strategies such as reference pricing and competitive tendering do not seem to be enough to stop the present trend of sky-rocketing prices. At present, the leading strategy for cost containment among European health authorities is to negotiate confidential prices directly with companies, an approach which inevitably lacks transparency [18].

Although many European health authorities have conventionally recurred to public procurement for buying vaccines, so as to exploit at most their purchasing power, the recent tendencies for pricing vaccines tend to follow those for drugs. Since any ‘competitor’ is (obviously) expected to be against price competition [19], nowadays the few (multinational) companies which market vaccines strive for undermining competitive tenders by differentiating their vaccines and launching the new ones (e.g., HPV and PCV) at prices which were unthinkable only a few years ago [20].",mainstream
1086,"The global war on women has for many years been an extremely hard-to-recognise war. For decades, it has carried a nice face, actually looking like just the opposite of war. But now, it gets another face - an ugly one. Just like the face of the other wars: That of terror and that of man-made global warming. These have long been recognizable as false and staged. Now, the global war on women is becoming visible. 

 

 For me, it started as a wondering: How come that more and more vaccination campaigns are targeted on women? Recently in Denmark, the media have been strongly marketing the HPV vaccination against cervical cancer, not as given to women of exactly that age where cervical cancer occurs, no, they are about to be included in the normal children's vaccination scheme, targeting girls at the age of 12 - where it has absolutely no positive effect. How come? 

 

 Just before that, the media announced that Bill Gates Foundation has granted 10 million Danish Kroners to a Copenhagen university for further research on a vaccine against Malaria, targeting women in the Third World. Women again ... why? 

 

 Before that, we saw so many campaigns in the whole western world on making HIV test mandatory for pregnant women. Since I have made extensive research on AIDS, this became my personal key point. As I shall explain, the existance of HIV virus has never been documented, nor has it's connection with AIDS. ""AIDS"" itself is a misleading term. The HIV test is not testing presence of any virus but is only indicating the presence of certain antibodies in blood. It is very often responding positivly on pregnancy, despite no particular virus is present. 

 

 Then why this obsession of testing pregnant women? 

 

 There are many other indications - which I shall explain - all pointing to the fact that something strange is going on in respect to women. I have earlier brought up the suspicion that it has to do with depopulation. We all know that the agenda for it has existed at least since World War II. We definitely know that it is under implementation in the Third World, mostly through economic means - the looting of money and natural resources from Africa and other continents, facilitated by the Debt Trap, IMF Structural Adjustments and World Bank administrations. 

 

 We also know that minimizing a population must target women, not men. Only by reducing the number of females can you reduce the amount of offspring. One man can fertilize thousands of women. One woman can not be fertilized by thousands of men. 

 

 Then I watched Dr. David Ayoubs video lesson <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6890106663412840646"" target=""_blank"">Global Vaccine Agenda</a> a second time and suddenly the whole picture was clear. In his lesson, Dr. Ayoub uses half the time explaining the connection between the increasing frequency of Autism in the US and the increased consumption of Mercury contained in vaccines. The rest is used to explain that the strange culture of vaccination plays a complete different role than what most of us think. 

 

 The Rockefeller Shadow

Dr. Ayoub's story starts in the year of 1952 where John D. Rockefeller the Third established the Population Council and thereby seriously brought the issue of overpopulation forth to the political arena. 

 

 In 1972, another commission, <i>The Rockefeller Commission on Population Growth</i>, completed a two years study on population growth, on request of then President Nixon. The commission concluded: 

 

 <i>""After two years of concentrated effort, we have concluded that, in the long run, no substantial benefits will result from further growth of the Nation's population, rather that the gradual stabilization of our population through voluntary means would contribute significantly to the Nation's ability to solve its problems. We have looked for, and have not found, any convincing economic argument for continued population growth. The health of our country does not depend on it, nor does the vitality of business nor the welfare of the average person"".</i> 

 

 Later, the report states: 

 

 <i>""By its very nature, population is a continuing concern and should receive contunuing attention. Later generations, and later commissions, will be able to see the right path into the future. In any case, no generation needs to know the ultimate goal or the final means, only the direction in which they will be found"". John D. Rockefeller 1972</i>. 

 

 Just two years later, in 1974, came the well known Henry Kissinger <i>National Security Study Memorandum 200</i> about ""the consequences of the global population growth for the US security and overseas interests"". A document we have known since it's declassification in 1989. What we also know is that the same Mr. Kissinger made his way into top US politics as a protegé of the Rockefellers. There is no doubt that there is a straight line from the Rockefeller report to the Kissinger memo. 

 

 The memo states that:
• We have unprecedented growth rates
• Lesser Developed Countries are growing faster
• Required US imports could be threatened
• Risk of global destabilization
• Urgent immediate measures must be taken to reduce fertility. 

 

 And the memo recommends these goals:
• Zero rate growth in the developed countries by 1985
• Zero rate growth in Lesser Developed Countries by 2000 

 

 It is worth noticing that this agenda shall be first implemented in our own western world and then later be exported to the Third World. Probably because people in the industrialized world are easier to work with, easier to reach by controlled centralized media, easier to experiment with and easier to follow up on when the efficiency of the campaigns shall be measured. 

 

 Which corresponds well with the fact that the birth rates in fact declined in the western world before it fell in the Third World. 

 

 Concerning the tools, the memo lists:
• Reproductive health (abortion, condoms)
• Sex education
• Improved health
• Women' equality
• Day care
• Government participation
• Improve social security
• Reduce infant mortality 

 

 Can we recognize some of these? Ay ... all of it, actually. They are exactly the ingredients characterizing the adult lifetime of my generation - the period from the 1970´ies and ahead. Overall and in every context, they were called ""welfare"" and there was a strong consensus that they were the result of a superior society model based on democracy. Now, suddenly we remain with the question: Were they just means to make us stop reproducing ourselves? 

 

 To answer that requires a deep analysis. Let us here just state that the headlines of our life actually can be regulated. That happens through regulation of the amount of money in circulation: When the central banks let out money in the market, we get ""welfare"". When they withdraw money from circulation, we get recession. The centralized management of the global media network makes it easy to control the ideas accompanying the money - and thereby channelling both money flow and ideas in the directions wanted. 

 

 What is hereafter a fact, is that we got the elements from the Kissinger memo. What likewise stands, is the fact that we got the declining birthrates. Around 1970, the birthrate in Denmark was 2.0. Today it is 1.7 - a good deal less than required to maintain the size of the population. We find a similar development all over the Western World. 

 

 Concerning the implementation in the Third World, the memo recommends the following vehicles:
• The World Bank
• WHO
• UNICEF
• Governments from ""donor"" countries
• UNFPA
• Private organizations and groups 

 

 This is reveiling a little bit more of how the world functions. An American financial elite demands an American Foreign Secretary to incorporate international organizations in his toolbox. We are not talking about a UN as ""united nations"" but about a UN as branches of American Foreign Department. 

 

 We also notice that the World Bank plays a central role. We are in the 1970´ies and the Third World is about to jump into the debt trap - a mechanism completely reversing the newly obtained ""independencies"". After a short period of time, it is clear that also these parts of the world are controllable, economically and politically. And the World Bank is, as we have since seen, the number one tool for control, backed up by the twin organization IMF. In their period of governance, the Third World has been steadily impoverished and steadily robbed for the natural richness of their continents. 

 

 Apart from that, the agenda of the memo covered by the health sector (WHO), the education sector (UNICEF), support from allied governments is secured and through financing of thousands of NGO´s it all gets a touch of people-to-people-commitment. 

 

 So far on the Kissinger memo, which we find important as a background painting making quite a lot of practical events understandable. Let´s then go to our main issue: The medical world and it's remarkable joy of vaccinations. (To be Continued Friday)

1156,"A British study supports the position of the anti-vaccination forces.

Parents who have had the traumatic experience of registering their children for school are familiar with the demand that the children have certain immunizations.

Those who don’t want to immunize their children face a gauntlet of state and federal problems and the possibility that their children will not be allowed to attend school without a court order.

The parents are assured that the federal government says the shots are safe and effective.

But things may not be as worry-free as the government says.

A United Kingdom study—not widely disbursed in this country—says the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) has been linked to a rare bleeding disorder in children.

According to research published Feb. 21, two out of every three cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), or bleeding under the skin, in the six weeks after MMR immunization are caused by the vaccine.

This accounts for one child in every 22,300 in the UK given the MMR vaccine who were admitted to the hospital.

The study, published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, was led by Dr. Elizabeth Miller of the Public Health Laboratory Service who has conducted extensive research into any adverse effects of the MMR vaccine.

The vaccine has been linked to an increase in a form of bowel disease and autism in children, although Miller’s earlier studies have found no association with autism.

The study says that ITP is caused by a shortage of platelets, the cells that make blood “sticky.”

In the general population, with or without MMR vaccinations, ITP occurs in about one in 10,000 people and in children and young people it is often preceded by a viral infection.",conspiracy
1242,"‘They have to get the shots’: Trump, once a vaccine skeptic, changes his tune amid measles outbreaks

As measles outbreaks rage in a number of states across the country, President Trump urged families to vaccinate their children on Friday.

“They have to get the shots. The vaccinations are so important,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House. “This is really going around now. They have to get their shots.”

The endorsement of vaccination from a previously vaccine-questioning president comes as a bit of a surprise. Before winning the presidency, Trump several times alleged there was a link between the number of vaccines children get in early infancy and the development of autism.

But since his inauguration, Trump has made no public comment about vaccines at all.

With the measles count in the United States hitting its highest point since 1994 this week, public health observers have questioned why this president, unlike predecessors going back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hasn’t been urging parents to vaccinate their children.

Some raised concerns that Trump’s track record on vaccination would undercut the credibility of any pro-vaccination message he delivered. But others noted that his base voters might be swayed if he endorsed vaccines.

“To me, this is one of the best things President Trump has done,” said Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of the history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, who called out Trump publicly on his silence in a recent op-ed published in the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Zimmerman called the move “politically brave,” noting there is an anti-vaccine faction within his base.

“I hope my fellow liberals will take a break from lambasting the President and congratulate him. Whatever his other wrongs, he was dead right about this,” Zimmerman said.

On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that reported measles cases in the country had hit 695, the highest number since before measles was declared in eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. Cases have been reported from 22 states.

The president’s comments were welcomed by Dr. Matt Zahn, the chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s public health committee, who suggested they could be helpful in winning over parents who worry about the safety of vaccines.

“It’s just so important that there’s clarity here,” said Zahn, who is medical director for the communicable diseases program for Orange County Public Health in California. “You are safer and the public will be healthier when our kids are getting immunized and when our community immunization rates go up.”

Orange County is home to Disneyland, the epicenter of a big measles outbreak in 2015. Working to contain it was an enormous amount of work, Zahn said.

He said there is a fear among public health officials that the ground is now shifting. Where in recent years U.S. measles numbers have been driven by one or two large outbreaks — among Amish communities in Ohio in 2014, Disneyland in 2015 — this year there are multiple large outbreaks around the country.

“It feels different,” Zahn said, noting that even counties like his that aren’t currently battling a measles outbreak are finding themselves having to chase down contacts who were exposed elsewhere. “There is an awful lot of spillover to other communities and to other counties.”

“I think for all of public health, we’re all a little apprehensive that we’re reaching a new normal wherein every community deals with these events or cases or outbreaks on a semi-regular basis,” he said.

And with a growing number of pockets across the country where vaccination rates are low, the U.S. is likely to find itself having to fight ever larger outbreaks when unvaccinated Americans get infected abroad and return home sick, or when infected tourists bring the virus to the country.

“We certainly have … communities of significant size in this country where immunization rates are quite low,” Zahn said. “So the ground in the United States is more fertile for these outbreaks than it has been in decades past.”",mainstream
20,"The first history of any vaccine goes back to China, hundreds of years ago, for smallpox. The first experimental use of vaccines goes back 200 years to Jenner in England, where he took a scab of cowpox from a cow and rubbed it on a cut on the arm of a boy, and there was sort of a reaction to it. And then--you never do this today--but he challenged the kid with authentic smallpox. And the boy did not get smallpox, so he made the correlation. 

 President emeritus of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University, Arntzen is working on making safer vaccines for viruses which kill millions in the developing world. He discusses his work developing edible vaccines (inside GM bananas, tomatoes, or potatoes). He also talks about Europe's opposition to GM foods and science's hopes for applying GM techniques to future foods, medicines, and environmental cleanup. (Interview conducted September 2000.) 

 That was the first model of a vaccine where you used, in that case, a related virus. Today we call them attenuated viruses, because they're like the real pathogen--a thing that causes disease--but they're either weakened, sometimes killed, chemically inactivated--or there are relatives. So it could be a virus that attacks cattle but not people, but it still triggers an immune response. So for 200 years, most vaccines have been built around this concept of using a relative of what causes disease in us, or an inactivated form. Then along came molecular biology in the mid- to late 1970s. The first vaccine that came out of this was for hepatitis B. The scientists in that case looked at the entire genome of the hepatitis B virus. That was a pretty heroic scientific feat, with the simple techniques they had about 25 years ago. But they found a gene in the virus that encodes, or it has the information for, the surface of the hepatitis B virus. You can picture hepatitis B like a little tennis ball. It's got a furry outside and that furry stuff on the outside is protein. That's what sticks to a human cell and causes the virus to be taken up. So these guys did take that gene, moved it to yeast, and grew the yeast in fermentation vats. Now the yeast produces a furry little tennis ball, or a virus-like particle, but there's nothing inside it, so there's no capacity for disease. They purified this furry little tennis ball from yeast, and now formulate it and put it into an injectable form. That was the first hepatitis B vaccine. That came out in 1986. It was licensed by the federal government as being very safe and very effective. That was the first of now what's appearing to be a flood of subunit vaccines that are coming in. 

 

 The molecular vaccines are really safe. Are there disadvantages? I don't want to emphasize that there are disadvantages to modern vaccines. But there inconveniences, if you will, and those relate to the cost. This is a pretty high-technology process. It's not been very easy to transfer it to developing countries. The second point is that these new vaccines all require refrigeration from the point of manufacture to the point of use. If you're trying to take a vaccine to a Third World country, that adds an enormous cost, and adds a certain unreliability. If this cold chain breaks down someplace, you could lose the effectiveness of your vaccine. So those are the two biggest issues. In addition, the World Health Organization says, ""We'd really like these to be oral vaccines, because they're easier to implement."" Their model for that is a polio vaccine--a simple thing that was developed more than two or three decades ago. You take the polio virus in a weakened form, but put it on a sugar cube, and just put that on the mouth or the tongue of a kid. It's an easy delivery mechanism. So the World Health Organization has been looking for the equivalent of the sugar cube delivery system. 

 

 What's wrong with syringes? Well, syringes cost money. Because they cost money, they're often inappropriately used in developing world. People try to clean them, and they shouldn't. They should be throwing them away, but at the cost, they add significantly to the delivery system. The World Health Organization estimates that there are hundreds of thousands of deaths and disease incidents caused by inappropriate needle use. So they'd like to get away from that technology. 

 

 Given those hurdles, how can a plant get you through this? With plant-based vaccines, we're not trying to replace the immunology side of it. We're totally dependent upon our friends who know virology and bacteriology to figure out how to find the genes and find the right components to make the vaccine. I picture myself, as a plant biologist, as a manufacturing specialist. We can put the gene now into the chromosome of the plant, so that every cell in the plant that comes back out of this has the capacity to manufacture a new protein. Then, even more, the plant itself is a delivery system. So if you can simply eat it, now you don't have to do any complex formulation; you don't have to do purification; and you don't have to deal with some of the other issues about toxicants or other materials that could get into the formulated vaccine. So plants offer a less expensive production system, and also, we believe, a more efficient and effective delivery system. Coupled with growing a plant and using food-processing technology to prepare the vaccine, we can now take existing technology that's in the developing world--agriculture and food processing that exists around the world--and adapt that to making a pharmaceutical. 

 

 Is it in a safe form in the plant? When we started thinking about delivery systems, the one that I began focusing on about eight years ago was bananas. When you start peeling a banana, the minute that peeling comes off, you are exposing a sterile environment inside. There are no bacteria. There are no fungi in there. This is a self-contained sterile container that also contains protein. So you can think of it as a sterile protein-manufacturing system. If we can put genes into bananas and cause them to produce the protein we want--in this case, a vaccine--in that sterile compartment, then all we have to do is pop it open and deliver it. 

 

 What is the process, from start to finish, of how you transform a plant? . . . We've spent the most time working on diseases caused by viruses or bacteria that . . . cause diarrhea. . . . Diarrheal disease is an enormous problem in the developing world. It causes deaths of about 2 million children every year. That comes from a variety of reasons: inadequate water purification, public hygiene systems, etc. That's one part of solving this problem in the long term. But in the short term, vaccines would be the best route to prevent the disease. 

 

 Because the disease is endemic? It's an endemic problem. Diarrheal disease re-occurs, especially in the developing world. Whenever they enter the monsoon season and other problems like that, it spreads more rapidly. Enormous loss of life occurs from diseases like cholera, enterotoxic E. coli, rotovirus outbreaks. 

 

 You've identified a pathogen you're interested in? . . . Let me try to describe how we make a vaccine for Norwalk virus. Norwalk virus causes diarrhea. You get it in contaminated food, and we in the U.S. would think of it as a case of food poisoning. The Norwalk virus, when we take it in with contaminated food, has a surface protein that binds to cells in our gut, primarily in the intestine. Once it binds, the viral material--which is genes from the virus--is injected into the epithelial cells in our gut. So, essentially, the virus takes over and does genetic engineering in the cells in our gut. The result is massive diarrhea, with its inconvenience, discomfort, etc. We in the U.S. generally do survive this, because we have rehydration therapy, etc. If you survive that, your immune system has been triggered, and the immune system now starts producing antibodies that are secreted into the gut. If that disease-causing agent comes along again, we're prepared for it. The antibodies bind to the virus and prevent the infection process. What we wanted to do was take the gene for that surface protein, put it into plant cells, and ask whether the plant would make a virus-like particle. It's a mimic, or a decoy, that looks like the virus, but with none of the genes inside, so it can't cause disease. First of all, we found that we could do that. We did that in collaboration with Mary Estes at Baylor College of Medicine, who's an expert in this stuff. 

 

 Do you use a gene gun technique to get them in? We use one of two routes to put the gene for Norwalk virus into plants. We can use the gene gun, so we essentially are shooting the piece of DNA into a plant cell, where it gets integrated into the chromosome. Or we use another approach, called agrobacterium-mediated transformation. That's where we first take the gene out of the virus and move it into a plant pathogen. Then the plant pathogen is a bacterium, and that moves the gene into a plant cell. Each system has some advantages. We can use either one. But we end up with an individual cell, which now has this new gene. From that cell, we regenerate a plant back. So the first part of this has just become absolutely routine. There's so much molecular biology going on around the world today. We can bring in a high school student and have them do the first part of putting the genes into the plants for us. The more complicated side of it then is to regenerate plants back out of this, look at each one and say, ""Is it producing the vaccine in the form we want it? Is it producing it in the right place?"" For instance, we initially focused on potatoes, and then tomatoes, and later banana fruit. We want to make sure that it's in the proper cells, that it's forming the right vaccine. 

 

 So the first one you did was the potato? That was the easiest to transform? . . . For a variety of reasons, the potato was simplest. You can put the genes in relatively easily. More important for us, we knew how to cause the genes to work in the potato tuber. There'd been a lot of work by collaborators of ours. So essentially, we had a good toolbox to work with, a molecular toolbox, so we could create the gene we wanted. The other nice thing about potatoes is that we can regenerate a lot of edible plant material back quickly. In about four to five months, we can have a pot full of potatoes, and each pot will give us probably about a kilogram of material. That's enough to do a lot of mouse feeding studies. 

 

 In these potatoes, everything else is the same, but there's an additional molecule being generated? Right. When they put a gene into a potato, essentially all we've added is one new protein. For all practical purposes, that's invisible. You don't see any effect of it. The way we determine that it is, in fact, there, is to do a bioassay. That means taking a piece of the potato and feeding it to a mouse, and then taking blood samples from the mouse and saying, ""Does it get new antibodies? Does it get an antibody against this protein we're interested in?"" Once we'd shown that that works with potatoes and what the advantage of the system was, we could save some of the potatoes and just cut them up into pieces, replant them. Now we get identical plants coming back out. So we had uniformity of our experiment. The next step for us has been to move the same type of work into tomatoes. That took a bit more work to build a toolbox, if you will, so we can create the genes that will work in the tomato fruit. 

 

 Before that, how were you sure this is working in the potato? The question is, ""How do we know that the vaccine is there?"" The answer is pretty simple. We just peel it, cut it up into cubes, and feed the potato to a mouse. We then take blood samples from that mouse on a periodic basis, and we ask if the mouse has serum antibodies, or is he now making antibodies against that protein? The answer was yes, we found them. . . . In all mammals, we're producing secretory antibodies all the time--in our lungs, in our saliva, throughout the gut. We can detect those antibodies in fecal pellets. Sure enough, after eating our genetically designed potatoes, the mouse would start making secretory antibodies. 

 

 Is the mouse a good model then for humans? Mice are the traditional model for human vaccines. Once we had pre-clinical data with mice, we then went to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and asked for permission to try the same experiments with people. They went through all the regulatory issues, and the first time we tried this, it took about eight months for us to get approval to guarantee safety for the volunteers. But we then had human volunteers eat some of our potatoes, and sure enough, got the same result. They got antibodies in the blood serum and secretory antibodies. So we can tell that the human immune system can also be triggered by simply eating raw potatoes that contain our vaccine that we've designed into them. 

 

 Do they have to eat raw potatoes? Well, raw potatoes aren't bad. I sat and ate raw potatoes when my mother was peeling them. I remember that as a kid. Now, we perhaps did a bit more, because some of the volunteers had to eat up to 100 grams of raw potato, which is about the size of a tennis ball or so. That's a big bowl of some starch. But they did it, and we thanked them for it, and sure enough, they got the proper immune response. 

 

 You were thinking that, because it was raw, this might not be the ideal delivery? Yes. The reason we do raw potatoes is because many of these antigens or vaccines that we're interested in would be destroyed by heating. So if you boiled the potatoes, if you made a mashed potato or a french fry, we anticipate that all the activity would be gone. 

 

 So then you moved on to other plants? Well, because you can't process or cook a potato easily, we decided that we're going to try the same experiments in other plants. The next step was to go to tomatoes. . . . One of the big reasons to try tomatoes is that they are easily processed. We can now start taking food-processing technology ... and just make tomato juice, or more important for us, we're trying to freeze-dry the tomato juice and just get a dry powder. I want to emphasize, why should we go and make a dry tomato powder? The answer is really that this is a medicine. We're not trying to make a new V8 juice. We're trying to make a medicine. If we're going to be successful, we have to deal with things that are part of the pharmaceutical industry. They talk about proper dosage. They talk about lot-to-lot variation, meaning, if you make up 100,000 doses at one time, the next lot has to be comparable in activity. The only way I can deal with that from a plant side of things is to start using food-processing technology to get a dry powder, or ultimately, when we get to bananas, I think something like a baby food puree. You can make tens of thousands of little containers of a banana baby food, and you can sample each one and verify that the dosage is uniform--that they're free of any sort of bacterial toxins or anything else--the standard sort of stuff that has to be done with any pharmaceutical product. Our switch on this is we can use food-processing technology, which is available in the developing world, and apply it to a medicine. 

 

 Assuming everything goes well, what is your vision? Let's say we want to deliver vaccines against diarrhea in Africa, where they're needed. I'll tell you what I do not see: I don't see a village banana tree with vaccines in it, where everyone goes up and takes one when they want to. That, for a variety of reasons, would be impractical. You wouldn't control dosage, etc. What I do see would be a company or a government organization established in a country--maybe South Africa initially, because they have a very good infrastructure. I see them having their own vaccine companies in South Africa, where they would take some of the plant material that's generated, begin to grow it under confined, regulated conditions, and manufacturing an herbal medicine of sorts. It's very acceptable and they're accustomed to it in Africa, and they're used to taking a dried plant material. Let's say it was a banana. Making a dried banana chip and delivering that in a little package, saying, ""This is a medicine"" would be normal. They have dried banana chips around the world. If we could just do that, or grind up this dried banana chip and spike it into a little milk and give it to an infant--that's something that could be done at a local level, without a lot of high technology. It would take an educational activity. But this is something that would be consistent with a type of medicine that they have today. 

 

 Would it be cheap? The question is, what would it cost to do this in a developing country? I think it's pretty obvious that the actual production of the material could be extremely cheap. The next step, having some sort of quality assurance, is tougher for me to estimate. You would want to make sure that you have the systems in place, that the dosage is accurate and reliable, and that the processing . . . is reliable. It's hard for me to anticipate the cost to this. But clearly it's something that's doable. There has to be a will to accomplish this. First of all, it doesn't have to be expensive. It simply has to be something that's built into an organization in the developing world. It's for these sorts of reasons that our goal isn't necessarily to take this first to a very poor country in Africa. In fact, we've built our first connections with extremely good, sophisticated scientists in Mexico. There is a demand for diarrheal disease vaccines in Mexico, and they have very good in-country vaccine companies. Some of these are already making and distributing vaccines. They have a very good public health system. So our goal is to try to collaborate with people in Mexico, transfer this technology, test it there, demonstrate that it works, and do that in parallel with what we're doing in the U.S. I should emphasize--we're trying to do this first in the U.S., not because I'm nationalistic, but because I don't want to be accused of taking this technology and testing it on poor people someplace else in the world. 

 

 We've had the rise of this controversy over genetically modified foods. Did this surprise you when it happened? Has it affected your work? The controversy over genetically modified foods really hasn't had any direct impact on our research activities. And I'm happy about that. I keep emphasizing, we're producing medicines. Materials that generate as an edible vaccine will never be in the grocery store, and we're building in controls to ensure that that won't happen. But in the broader issue, am I surprised at what has happened? Perhaps not, because I think this has been a surprise to the public. They haven't seen all this background science and technology being developed. It's been something that is so common to us in the scientific community. I haven't seen anything that's shocking or that concerns me about any sort of safety issue, but I've seen it coming for the last 20-plus years. It seems obvious and routine to me. But I certainly am aware, just from my conversations with family and relatives, that they find it shocking that all these changes are possible. It's sort of science fiction stuff, and I guess whenever something comes along that you hadn't thought about, it raises some concerns. 

 

 What potential in this technology people should be aware of? Well, clearly the next generation of plants that are genetically modified are going to be enormously different from the first generation that came out. We're seeing a lot more activity that's focused around human health. There are a variety of reasons for that, but probably the greatest reason in the U.S. is that we've got excess food today. There's less return in just increasing yields. What we have to focus on is how we make our foods better. We can keep reminding ourselves that we can do things that will improve the human health value, that we're going to add value to society and to the products that farmers are producing, and we're going to have a good economic impact all throughout this food chain. My own special interest is this area of producing actual pharmaceuticals in plants. Because of the institute where I am, it really hasn't been a focus on the U.S. in particular. It's been more a focus on the Third World. How can we deliver . . . a very effective vaccine, but make developing countries less dependent upon philanthropy and big industry and things of that nature? How can we provide the technology so that a Third World country can make the vaccines themselves? 

 

 Is this technology useful because it allows you to grow plants in inhospitable soils? What about the ""golden rice"" argument? Well, if you start looking at specific examples of where genetically modified foods have a value in the developing world, I think number one is the issue of food security--protecting plants against disease, so that they grow better. Also, perhaps, virus resistance, sort of immunizing plants against viruses as the number one example. It's going to have the biggest effect in the developing world. But secondarily, as we have seen with the golden rice story, you can also change the qualities of the plant itself. We can put things like vitamin A into a rice plant, as Dr. Potrykus and his colleagues did. That's quite incredible, and it's going to solve major problems in the developing world, as to the availability of food materials for good nutrition. I know that a standard response is, ""Well, they should just be eating more green leafy vegetables."" I've been to India. I've stayed in a very nice hotel in the center of New Delhi. And you see families living on the sidewalk on an old patch of blanket out there. This is part of this global migration of families to the cities, as populations grow. They no longer have a little garden plot to grow their materials. They're stuck in a concrete jungle someplace. They don't have access to green leafy vegetables and things that they need, and they're living on a handful of rice every day. I see the Rockefeller Foundation and others recognizing this, and seeing that we've got these global shifts in people stuck in desperate poverty, and the few foods they can eat. They have focused on issues like, how can we change the quality of that food that they do have available, and improve the nutrition of these people? 

 

 Because the people aren't getting a balanced diet? Because they get a balanced diet. They're desperately poor. They're part of this urban migration that is just dragging people into a situation where they have no choice. It would be nice to solve the poverty issue. That would be great. But until we can do that, one of the accomplishments of modifying our food is that we can help give these desperately poor people something better to improve their health as they try to dig their way out of the situation that they're in. 

 

 Greenpeace says that there's enough food to feed the world already--that the problem is distribution. Yes. The argument that there's enough food in the world, but it's in the wrong place at the wrong time--that's a real argument. But a lot of the food sources we have are not easily shipped. A fresh tomato isn't going to be shipped from Iowa to Bangladesh. Grains can be shipped--cereal , grains, and legumes and things like that. But we tried some experiments of just shipping food and giving it away. For instance, in India and Bangladesh in the 1960s, when there was famine, if a country like the U.S. comes in and just provides food, it further degrades the capacity of the country itself to stimulate its own agricultural economy. I think we saw when we made those mistakes at one time, and then we shifted our emphasis on providing the technology to people to produce their own food. That's been much more successful. In a sense, we haven't even been involved in it so much in China, but you can see the enormous advancements in China in feeding their own people. It's been through an implementation of good agricultural policy, using the best of the new technologies that are available, and moving very rapidly. If you travel in China today, you don't see the starvation that is prevalent in other parts of the world, especially in the poorer parts of the world today. 

 

 Is it your sense that India and China see a lot of potential in this technology? It's very interesting to compare India and China. China has moved very aggressively in all aspects of food technology, emphasizing things like infrastructure for transport of foods, but also rapidly mobilizing to use new genetic engineering techniques. Essentially, they don't take just one part of it. Biotechnology is not a sole solution, but a whole structural analysis is a solution. I've traveled a fair amount in India. India has apparently just taken more of a piecemeal part. It's a highly democratic country, and some of the disadvantages of democracy have come in not having China's sort of overall planning system. But India has done a remarkable job of feeding a population that has doubled in the last several decades. They're still feeding their people. They have been slower to adopt technology for genetic engineering, and in part, maybe that's because they haven't had the demand yet. They haven't had the food demands that China has seen. 

 

 We have a projection over the next 100 years of a doubling of world population. Without new agricultural technologies, is that going to be impossible? Well, it's hard for me to talk about what's going to happen over the next 100 years or 50 years. It's easier to picture what's going to happen over the next two decades. Now, we have the young people born on the ground today, who are going to produce an additional 1 billion people each decade. That many new people every ten years is the size of India. When you start thinking of this massive food need that we have--and largely the population is increasing where we don't have an adequate food supply--we're just going to exacerbate all the problems we have today. Of course we need new technology. We can't just continue to plow up forests or try to find new prairies to convert into farmland. That doesn't exist in the places we need it, and we don't want to shift the remaining natural areas of the world that we have today and destroy them to get more farmland. All we can do is increase the productivity of the land that we have today, to meet this enormous coming increase in population. 

 

 The other argument is that a more efficient type of organic farming should be instituted, rather than developing new technology. It's really baffling to me how anyone can say that we just don't need new technology. India is largely an organic farming nation today. As they try to take on new technology, the most successful has been genetic technology. It's the improved rices that came out of international research activities, and the improved wheats. Taking genetically improved materials is what's allowed them to feed their population. Some of that has been coupled with use of fertilizer, for instance, in India, which has dramatically increased the rice yields. What's missing in places like India, for instance, is a lot of additional technology--like post-harvest storage of the material, drying of the material, packaging of it, so they don't have losses to insects or disease problems in the stored material. So I think people are fixated right now on, ""Oh, my God, they're doing something with genetics, and that's the problem."" But we have a whole suite of things that need to be done in agriculture, and using the best of new genetics is just part of the solution. It's not a silver bullet that's going to work by itself. But it's just part of the overall solution. 

 

 We see the moratorium in Europe, and labeling laws. And you see a few companies in this country, like Gerber and Frito-Lay, deciding not to produce these. Do you have any concerns that this might be delayed, or stopped in its tracks? Clearly, the attitudes about genetically modified foods in Europe have delayed its implementation in Europe. I think their perceptions are based upon a series of other things that don't have any relevance to genetic engineering per se. 

 

 Such as? Such as, they have problems with BSE, the mad cow disease, which has caused in England in particular a lack of confidence in their regulatory system. A whole series of other events in Europe has just caused people to be concerned about safety of their food supply. None of these have any relevance directly to genetic engineering, but it's caused the public to question their governments and what their governments can do. In addition, the Europeans are affluent. They have an excess supply of food, and they're subsidizing their farmers to reduce production. And I can understand this. The whole notion of adding new technology to add more food seems bizarre. . . . Why is it different in the U.S.? Well, in part, I believe, even though we have more food than we need, most folks here recognize that the food supply from the U.S. is part of the global economy. It's good for our economics, but it's also good for the rest of the world. Because if we just stopped exporting food, it would have an enormous impact on other parts of the world. So I see a fundamental difference there in the acceptance of the technology. Let's say that the U.S. and Europe would decide, ""We're never going to do genetically modified foods."" . . . I don't think it's going to stop the technology. It's so essential for China, for India, for other parts of the developing world to increase their food supply to meet their burgeoning populations; it's going to happen. We can't be so arrogant to think that we determine what sort of science is going to be done on a global basis. We can be pleased with ourselves that, in the U.S., we've really been the leaders in developing the new technology and implementing it safely in this country. We haven't had so much as a headache from any genetically modified food, and I think that's because we thought about these things. We go back to something called the Asilomar Conference, back in the 1970s. Back in the 1980s, I was involved in government committees that dealt with safety issues, about what type of genetic engineering we could do, how we would move genetically modified plants into the field. We've been working on this stuff since the technology was developed. In the U.S. it's been science-driven. We have had great cooperation between federal agencies. But we've had the scientists who understand this and who developed it, working on this all the way through. 

 

 So, people who say that regulatory agencies are giving this a free ride--are they wrong? I think we've got a very efficient regulatory system in the U.S. I believe it's because we've focused on science, and we've had the scientists who understand this, engaged from the beginning--back from the 1970s. The idea that the U.S. government is just letting things fly through--I can guarantee you that it's not the case. The amount of time we've spent in the last two years just dealing with regulatory issues to test our plant-based vaccines . . . at times, as a scientist, I'm ready to pull my hair out, saying, ""Why don't these people just let us move ahead? Let's get on with it."" We've got something that can solve a world problem, and they want us to write another form to prove that this is safe, etc. At the same time, as a rational scientist, I've seen this stuff evolving, and I also know that we have to do this. While I'm absolutely convinced that the products we're testing for vaccines are safe, I know that perception is a crucial issue. If we ever did something that would cause the public to lose confidence in what we're doing, what I've spent the last nine years on could just collapse. Then I'd really be frustrated. So I want to make sure that we do this right. In spite of how frustrated I get with government folks at some times, I'm so pleased they're there, because I know that, in the U.S., we have this process in place. I can always refer back to it and say, ""Yes, we've done all these things, we've considered all these things, and it works."" 

 

 Are you concerned about safety and ecological issues? Well, I'm very concerned about the perception issues. From a scientific standpoint, I don't see anything inherently unsafe about what we're doing in putting genes into, say, a tomato, that would cause a tomato to produce a vaccine. But I am extremely concerned that someone might say, ""Oh, he's putting hepatitis B in tomatoes."" Well, we're not, of course. But it's so easy to make an incorrect assumption about this. So what we're trying to do is build in safeguards right now. We have funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a project that I think is pretty neat. We are taking our tomatoes, which now contain genes for a vaccine. We're crossing them into other genetic varieties that are male-sterile--that means they don't produce pollen. Furthermore, with these plants now, we're crossing them so that we will produce seedless tomatoes. . . . So we can grow tomatoes now--and I would expect this would be done in greenhouses, because that's pretty standard production system--but there would be no pollen, no seeds. There's no way that this stuff can inadvertently escape into the environment. It's going to add a little bit of cost to the production, because we'll have to make cuttings of our tomatoes to get the next generation, rather than collecting seeds. But I believe that to prevent misperception is much more important. So even though I don't see the safety need for this, I firmly believe that we should move in this direction, to give the public confidence that our vaccine-containing tomatoes are never going to show up in the marketplace in their grocery store. 

 

 In addition to using plants for food, what are the things we might use in the future? We're just at the tip of the iceberg of an enormous number of things that will be technically possible to do with plants. Some folks are talking about how they are going to change the qualities of plants so that they'll be able to do bio-remediation and clean up toxic sites. To some extent, that is a viable technology, and it's a sustainable way of dealing with complex issues. We're clearly going to use plants to produce more nutritious foods, or actually medicines themselves, as I've talked about. I see that we're going to also very rapidly move into biological systems to produce industrial precursor chemicals. Growing switchgrass, for instance, a very easy, high-productive grass to make chemicals, which will substitute for petrochemicals coming out of the petrol industry. Now that petroleum is upwards from $30 a barrel, this sort of interest gets more interesting. All of these things . . . don't have to depend on genetic modification. But what we're going to find is that more and more examples will appear where, if you could switch off a gene or an enzyme in a plant, or you could add some new component, it's going to make it much easier to do. If we can just cut down the amount of lignin in the poplar trees that we're growing for paper pulp to make newspapers, and get less lignin contamination in streams and waterways, that makes a lot of sense. As time goes on, as we try more and more systems over the next two decades, we're going to see a gradual replacement to using the power of genetics, a sustainable modification of a biological resource, as the much preferred avenue over using cost-intensive industrial processes to do the same things. 

 

 What's the idea in taking a quality from one organism into another? . . . An example that's used a lot was the flounder gene into tomatoes. The background of it, from a scientific standpoint, is that we have a good understanding of why some fish can tolerate cold, like the flounder. We'd like to have some of our fruits and vegetables tolerate cold, like strawberries, so they don't get nipped by an early frost, or by a late frost. So scientists have done experiments trying to mimic the cellular environment of a flounder in a strawberry. These are really excellent basic science studies, and I should emphasize, they've never gone beyond that. No one's ever started a commercial development of anything from it. But I think the public responds negatively to that. My perception, after talking just to family members and others, is that you can almost see their nose wrinkling up, because there's something about a fishy smell to a strawberry. It's a mental image. More than anything else, it's just, ""Ooh, I wouldn't like that."" It has nothing to do with the science, I believe. It's just the way we're wired in our brain. A fish is supposed to smell like a fish, and a strawberry like a strawberry. And just superimposing words on each other--we back off. We don't like that. . . . 

 

 People don't see the connection between humans and the tomato in terms of the shared genetic heritage. Do you think we have a big educational job here? Genetics is a really complex issue for public acceptance, because almost all the things we think about with regard to genetics have been bad. It somehow goes back to Hitlerism and something that has a negative connotation. When the positive stories about genetics have come out, about increasing the yields of our crops or making larger tomatoes or strawberries that taste good, that's genetics. But those stories aren't linked to genetics. We just have the wrong connection of negative images, and I think that persists at the present time. How do you educate the public? That's being a little bit arrogant on the scientific standpoint. They should know as much as we do. I'd say it's more like, how do you interest the public in genetics, causing the public to want to inquire more and understand more about it? And I think that's going to be one of the positive outcomes of all this genetically modified food, because once the initial potentially negative response occurs, I think we have an intelligent public overall. They want to know more about this. As they begin to understand that it's just a continuation of what we've been doing in crop improvement for the last 100 years, it's Burpee's tomatoes, you know, the old seed catalogues that our parents used to buy. It's just in a new formulation. Once people realize this, then I think all of this is going to calm down. 

 

 We had this controversy in medical research in the 1970s, and most people now accept that genetically engineered insulin is a good thing. Do you think we'll get to that stage with agriculture? It's not controversial anymore in medicine. I don't think in general that the public is concerned about the use of biotechnology to make products for medicine anymore. Clearly, there are still issues with regard to the origin of stem cells for treatment. There will be more controversies that will come along in human medicine, but they're not focused on the process of biotechnology. I believe that's because of the profound benefits that we've seen from some of the new products. I believe, as a new generation of products appears in the agricultural side, as the public sees the immediate benefit and value from these things, we will slide into this same sort of acceptance. Essentially what we're going to move to, rather than focusing on how it was done, we're going to focus on, ""What's the outcome? What is the material that we're going to get in the end of the day? Is it better for my health? Is it better for the way we treat the environment? Is it good for the developing world and for solving problems of global importance?"" . . .",mainstream
10,"Genocidal corporate media presstitutes follow the all-too-familiar script of blaming the victim for the crimes perpetrated by aggressor nations.

NATO terrorists, for example, are invading and occupying Syria, and the Syria government is blamed for the ensuing disasters, but the presstitutes omit this from their narratives and instead find creative ways to blame the Assad government whose duty it is to protect Syria, its sovereignty, and its territorial integrity. When terrorists are occupying cities, as they do in Syria, innocent people will always be victimized, including during government operations to clear out the terrorist infestations, but the presstitutes blame the Syrian government, not the NATO terrorists.

President Assad is fraudulently demonized for a war perpetrated by aggressors who are tasked with destroying Syria so the West can further the destruction under a fraudulent Responsibility To Protect (R2P) mandate, wherein criminal West promises to save Syrians from the West’s own terrorists. It’s basically a Mafia –style protection racket writ large: If Assad steps down, we’ll “protect you” and replace him with a Wahhabi stooge government, and everyone will be happy.

The reality of course, is that if the Western terrorists win the war, Syria will be totally destroyed, much like Libya, Iraq, and the Ukraine.

The crimes of the aggressors have been well-documented for years, and all but ignored by the presstitutes.

A 2012 Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) memo stated unequivocally that the U.S support for ISIS was willful. In an interview with Mehdi Hasan, Michael T. Flynn, former director of the DIA, was blunt.

“In 2012 the U.S. was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups [Salafists, Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaeda in Iraq], why did you not stop that if you’re worried about the rise of quote-unquote Islamic extremists?”

Flynn responded, “ I hate to say it’s not my job…but that…my job was to…was to to ensure that the accuracy of our intelligence that was being presented was as good as it could be.

The New York Times newspaper, another propaganda outlet, can’t help but reveal the truth, even if indirectly, when, in a recent article, “C.I.A. Arms for Syrian Rebels Supplied Black Market, Officials Say” it acknowledged that “ Weapons shipped into Jordan by the Central Intelligence Agency and Saudi Arabia (were) intended for Syrian rebels.”

Meanwhile, UN Security Council Resolution 1373 states clearly that:

All of this evidence assigns guilt directly to the West for the disaster befalling Syria. The West’s actions contradict international law, and they expose the lies of the presstitute media that typically vilifies the Assad government rather than the real perpetrators (including themselves).

Yet another recent article, “U.S. Relies Heavily on Saudi Money to Support Syrian Rebels”, indicates that the West is also behind the financing of the terrorists. The writers revel that:

Financing terrorists is also a violation of UN Resolutions (and international law). UN Resolution 2199 “urges”,

Add to this the fact that now Israel is publicly admitting that it prefers ISIS to the Syrian government, and we see that the presstitute narratives are falling apart yet again.

Dr. Bouthaina Shaaban, Syrian President Bashar Assad’s media advisor correctly assesses the damage committed by Western media outlets that propagate false narratives about Syria:

What will be the next story advanced by the genocidal media to account for the clear criminality of the West and its terrorists?

How many more thousands of innocent people will lose their lives because of the Western lies, and the grovelling presstitute media echo chambers covering for the criminality of the Western foreign policies?",conspiracy
769,"In virology, the pandemic H1N1/09 virus is a swine origin influenza A virus subtype H1N1 strain that was responsible for the 2009 swine flu pandemic. This strain is often called swine flu by the public media. For other names, see the Nomenclature section below.

The virus is a novel strain of the influenza virus,[2] for which existing vaccines against seasonal flu provided no protection. A study at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published in May 2009 found that children had no preexisting immunity to the new strain but that adults, particularly those over 60, had some degree of immunity. Children showed no cross-reactive antibody reaction to the then-new strain, while adults aged 18 to 64 had 6–9%, and older adults 34%.[3][4] Much reporting of early analysis repeated that the strain contained genes from five different flu viruses: North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza, and two swine influenza viruses typically found in Asia and Europe.[5] Further analysis showed that several of the proteins of the virus are most similar to strains that cause mild symptoms in humans, leading virologist Wendy Barclay to suggest that the virus was unlikely to cause severe symptoms for most people.[6] Other leading researchers indicated that all segments of the virus were in fact swine in origin, despite it being a multiple reassortment.[7][8] The first complete genome sequence of the pandemic strain was deposited in public databases on April 27, 2009, by scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.[9] Scientists in Winnipeg later completed the full genetic sequencing of viruses from Mexico and Canada on May 6, 2009.[10]

Analysis of the genetic divergence of the virus in samples from different cases indicated that the virus jumped to humans in 2008, probably after June, and not later than the end of November,[11] likely around September 2008.[12][13] A report by researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 2016 found that the 2009 H1N1 virus likely originated from pigs in a very small region of central Mexico.[14]

On April 17, 2009, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determined that two cases of febrile respiratory illness occurring in children who resided in adjacent counties in Southern California were caused by infection with a swine influenza A (H1N1) virus. The viruses from the two cases were closely related genetically, resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, and contain a unique combination of gene segments that previously had not been reported among swine or human influenza viruses in the United States or elsewhere. After the emergence of the novel virus in the spring of 2009, it spread quickly across the United States, Mexico and the world.[15][16]

In late April, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared its first ever ""public health emergency of international concern"", or PHEIC,[17] and in June, the WHO and the U.S. CDC stopped counting cases and declared the outbreak a pandemic.[18]

On June 23, 2009, The New York Times reported that U.S. federal agriculture officials believed that, ""contrary to the popular assumption that the new swine flu pandemic arose on factory farms in Mexico"", now believe it ""most likely emerged in pigs in Asia, but then traveled to North America in a human"". They emphasized that there was no way to prove their hypothesis but said there is no evidence this new virus, which combines Eurasian and North American genes, has never circulated in North American pigs, ""while there is tantalizing evidence that a closely related 'sister virus' has circulated in Asia"".[19] However, a subsequent report by researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 2016 found that the 2009 H1N1 virus likely originated in central Mexico.[14]

In early June 2009, using computational methods developed over the previous ten years, an international team of researchers attempted to reconstruct the origins and timescale of the 2009 flu pandemic. Oliver Pybus of Oxford University's Department of Zoology, and part of the research team, claims ""Our results show that this strain has been circulating among pigs, possibly among multiple continents, for many years prior to its transmission to humans."" The research team who worked on this case also believed it was ""derived from several viruses circulating in swine"", and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. The team concluded that ""despite widespread influenza surveillance in humans, the lack of systematic swine surveillance allowed for the undetected persistence and evolution of this potentially pandemic strain for many years.""[20]

According to the researchers, movement of live pigs between Eurasia and North America ""seems to have facilitated the mixing of diverse swine influenza viruses, leading to the multiple reassortment events associated with the genesis of the (new H1N1) strain"". They also said this new pandemic ""provides further evidence of the role of domestic pigs in the ecosystem of influenza A"".[21]

In November 2009, a study was published in Virology Journal in which it was suggested that the virus may be the product of three strains from three continents that swapped genes in a lab or a vaccine-making plant, and subsequently ""escaped"". The study followed debate among researchers in May 2009, when the authors asked the World Health Organization (WHO) to consider the hypothesis. After reviewing the initial paper, WHO and other organizations concluded the pandemic strain was a naturally-occurring virus and not laboratory-derived.[22][23]

The virus is contagious with an R of 1.4 to 1.6[24] and spreads from human to human in much the same way as seasonal flu. The most common mechanisms by which it spreads are by droplets from coughs and sneezes of infected people, and also potentially touching a surface or the hand of a person contaminated with the virus and then touching one's eyes, nose or mouth.[25] In 2009, the WHO reported that H1N1/09 seemed to be more contagious than seasonal flu.[26] However, a New England Journal of Medicine report said the transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in households was lower than that seen in past pandemics.[27] The U.S. CDC recommended that people should wait at least a day after their fever subsides (usually 3–4 days after the onset of symptoms) before resuming normal activities, but it has been found that they can continue to shed virus for several more days.[28]

The virulence of swine flu virus is mild and the mortality rates are very low.[29][30]

In mid-2009, the U.S. CDC noted that most infections were mild, similar to seasonal flu, and that recovery tended to be fairly quick.[31] The number of deaths as of September 2009 was said to be a tiny fraction of the annual number of deaths from seasonal flu.[32] However, comparisons of human fatality figures with seasonal influenza are prone to underestimate impact of the pandemic,[33] and the pandemic H1N1/09 virus was in fact the dominant strain of influenza causing illness in the 2009/10 flu season.[34]

Research carried out at Imperial College London[35] has shown that, unlike seasonal flu, H1N1/09 can infect cells deep in the lungs. Seasonal flu can infect only cells with receptor type a2-6 which are typically located in the nose and throat but H1N1/09 can also infect cells with receptor type a2-3. This may explain why some patients experience severe respiratory symptoms. (The H5N1 virus is also able to infect cells deep in the lungs with receptor type a2-3 but cannot infect cells with receptor type a2-6 making it less contagious than H1N1/09.)

As of September 2009 , most people infected by this flu suffered a mild illness, but the small minority hospitalized were often severely ill. Arand Kumar, an intensive care expert at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada, said ""this pandemic is like two diseases; either you're off work for a few days or you go to hospital, often to the intensive-care unit (ICU). There's no middle ground."" In the southern hemisphere 15 to 33% of hospitalized cases went to the ICU in July and August 2009. Unlike H5N1 avian flu and SARS which provoke a runaway body-wide immune response, H1N1/09 destroys the lungs' alveoli, often causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, which kills in half of all cases. Preliminary research suggests that severity is linked to a genetic variation in immune systems.[36]

From April 2009 to November 2009, 3,900 people died of the H1N1 pandemic virus in the U.S. This is sometimes compared to the 36,000 people per year who die from the ""common flu"", mostly in winter, although this number is an estimate.[37] The death rate of H1N1 in the U.S. was calculated as less than 0.02% from November 2009 figures from the CDC,[38] and has been explicitly calculated as 0.026% in England.[39]

Existing vaccines against seasonal flu provided no protection. Vaccines were released in North America in late October. Production may be three billion doses per year rather than the earlier estimate of five billion.[40]

On May 22, 2009, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan said the virus must be closely monitored in the southern hemisphere, as it could mix with ordinary seasonal influenza and change in unpredictable ways.[citation needed] Experts writing in the July issue of The New England Journal of Medicine noted that historically, pandemic viruses have evolved between seasons, and the current strain may become more severe or transmissible in the coming months. They therefore stressed the importance of international cooperation to engage in proper surveillance to help monitor changes in the virus's behavior, which will aid in both ""vaccine targeting"" and interpreting illness patterns in the fall of 2009.[41]

Other experts in 2009 were also concerned that the new virus strain could mutate over the coming months. Guan Yi, a leading virologist from the University of Hong Kong, for instance, described the new H1N1 influenza virus as ""very unstable"", meaning it could mix and swap genetic material (reassortment) when exposed to other viruses. During an interview he said, ""Both H1N1 and H5N1 are unstable so the chances of them exchanging genetic material are higher, whereas a stable (seasonal flu) virus is less likely to take on genetic material."" The H5N1 virus is mostly limited to birds, but in rare cases when it infects humans it has a mortality rate of between 60% to 70%.[42] Experts worry about the emergence of a hybrid of the more virulent Asian-lineage HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) A/H5N1 strain (media labeled ""bird flu"") with more human-transmissible influenza A strains such as this novel 2009 swine-origin A/H1N1 strain (media labeled ""swine flu""), especially since the H5N1 strain is endemic among birds in countries like China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt.[42][43] (See the suite of H5N1 articles for details.)

Other studies concluded that the virus was likely well adapted to humans, had a clear biological advantage over seasonal flu strains and that reassortment was unlikely at that time due to its ease in replication and transmission.[44] However, Federal health officials in the U.S. noted that the horrific 1918 flu epidemic, which killed hundreds of thousands in the United States alone, was preceded by a mild ""herald"" wave of cases in the spring, followed by devastating waves of illness in the autumn.[45] As of late July 2009, U.S. health officials said the swine flu wasn't yet mutating to become more dangerous, but they were closely tracking that as the virus continued to circle the globe.[46]

As of October 2009, research done by Taubenberger showed that the evolution of A (H1N1) is relatively slow since the structure of the 2009 H1N1 virus is similar to the strain of H1N1 implicated in the 1918 flu pandemic.[47] A study from Hokkaido University found a sequence homology between the Hemagglutinin antigen amino acid residues found in the earlier 1918 strain and the 2009 H1N1 strain. This may have played a role in individuals who had been infected with the 1918 strain and its early descendants in showing stronger specific immunity to the 2009 H1N1 virus. This finding provided insight into future monitoring of the H1N1 virus and its evolution within the human population.[48]

On November 20, 2013, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health released a statement saying they had discovered a potentially significant mutation in the H1N1 influenza strain that could be responsible for causing the severest symptoms among those infected. In the statement they said ""The mutation could be affecting the virus' ability to go deeper into the respiratory system, thus causing more serious illness"".[49]

The World Health Organization said the mutation did not appear to be widespread in Norway and the virus in its mutated form remained sensitive to antivirals and pandemic vaccines. A similar mutation had been detected in H1N1 viruses circulating in several other countries, including China and the United States, in severe as well as in some mild cases. ""Although further investigation is under way, no evidence currently suggests that these mutations are leading to an unusual increase in the number of H1N1 infections or a greater number of severe or fatal cases.""[49]

On December 2, 2009, the WHO announced that they had been informed of two recent clusters of patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses. Both clusters, detected in the UK (including Wales) and in North Carolina, occurred in a single ward and involved patients whose immune systems were severely compromised or suppressed. Transmission of resistant virus from one patient to another is suspected in both outbreaks.

As of December 2010 , the WHO reported 314 samples of 2009 pandemic H1N1 flu tested worldwide have shown resistance to oseltamivir (Tamiflu). This was not totally unexpected as 99.6% of the seasonal H1N1 flu strains tested have developed resistance to amantadine and rimantadine.[51] As of August 2009 no circulating flu had yet shown any resistance to zanamivir (Relenza), the other available anti-viral.[52]

Before being transmitted to humans, an H1N1 type virus is known to have circulated in swine. In August 2007, about 25 people and 160 pigs developed flu at a county fair in Ohio. Analysis showed they were infected with the same strain—an H1N1 type containing genes of human, bird and swine origin. A 2004 study found that in Iowa, 20 percent of swine veterinarians and 3 percent of meatpackers, but no university workers, had antibodies in their blood indicating they had been infected with swine flu. Another study, of 804 rural Iowans, found that pig farmers were 50 times more likely, and their spouses about 30 times more likely, than university workers to carry swine flu antibodies.[53] Pigs are also known to have been infected by humans.[54]

Humans have been affected since early 2009. The November 27, 2009 worldwide update by the U.N.'s World Health Organization (WHO) states that ""more than 207 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 7,820 deaths"". The WHO has also tracked more than 622,482 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1.[55] The symptoms of this virus are identical to that of seasonal influenza.

In late August 2009, the government of Chile discovered that the human H1N1/09 virus had jumped, unmutated, to birds, ""opening a new chapter in the global epidemic"". Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. They said the infected turkeys had suffered only mild effects, easing concern about a potentially dangerous development. Chile's turkey meat remained safe to eat, they said, and so far there had been no signs of a potentially dangerous mutation.[56] Virus experts were concerned that a more dangerous and easily transmitted strain could emerge if H1N1/09 combines again with avian flu, which is far more virulent but much less contagious to humans. By October 2009, another outbreak was identified at a turkey breeder in Ontario, Canada.[57]

In October 2009, a ferret exhibiting flu symptoms was confirmed to have contracted the H1N1 virus from its owner in Oregon.[58] In November 2009, a case of novel H1N1 was confirmed in a household cat.[59][60][61] Although the earliest cat fatality from the H1N1 virus in the U.S. occurred in Pennsylvania,[62] the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association was the first to confirm a cat fatality in the U.S. The association recommended that cat owners with flu symptoms avoid touching cat's eyes, nose, and mouth while sick. They recommended thoroughly washing hands after handling a sick pet as it might be possible for cats to transmit the virus to humans. This was the third confirmed case of H1N1 in a cat in the U.S.; other cases have occurred in Utah and Iowa.[63] The first case of a dog with H1N1 was reported in December 2009.[64] On July 22, 2011 the Norwegian Veterinary Institute reported the first occurrence of 2009-H1N1 influenza virus in minks.[65]

The initial outbreak of a novel[2] swine-origin H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 and the virus strain that caused it were called by many names. In July 2009, WHO experts named the virus ""pandemic H1N1/09 virus"" to distinguish it from both various seasonal H1N1 virus strains and the 1918 flu pandemic H1N1 strain.

Some authorities objected to calling the flu outbreak ""swine flu"". U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack expressed concerns that this would lead to the misconception that pork is unsafe for consumption.[66] The CDC began referring to it as ""novel influenza A (H1N1)""; ""A/H1N1"" is sometimes used.[2][67] The CDC stopped using the nomenclature ""novel H1N1"" and updated various web pages to reflect the change to ""2009 H1N1 Flu"". In the Netherlands it was originally called ""pig flu"" but, later called ""Mexican flu"" by the National Health Institute and in the media. South Korea and Israel briefly considered calling it the ""Mexican virus"".[68] Later the South Korean press used ""SI"", short for ""swine influenza"". Taiwan suggested the names ""H1N1 flu"" or ""new flu"", which most local media adopted.[69] The World Organization for Animal Health proposed the name ""North American influenza"".[70] The European Commission adopted the term ""novel flu virus"".[71]

The name A(H1N1)pdm09 later came into widespread use, sometimes qualified as A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm, etc.[72][73]

The pdm09 in the above nomenclature refers to Pandemic Disease Mexico 2009.

On April 24, 2009, the U.S. CDC determined that seven samples from suspected cases in Mexico matched the strain that had infected patients in Texas and California with no known linkages to animals or one another; the strain appeared to be spreading from human to human.[82][83] The CDC determined that the strain contained genes from four different flu viruses—North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza, and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe—""an unusually mongrelised mix of genetic sequences"".[5] A CDC investigative team arrived in Mexico City on April 25, 2009 to work with Mexican counterparts to study the virus.[84]

Pigs are susceptible to influenza viruses that can also infect both humans and birds, so they may act as a ""mixing vessel"" in which reassortment can occur between flu viruses of several species.[85][86] Reassortment is a process that happens if two different types of influenza virus infect a single cell and it can produce a new strain of influenza. This is because the virus genome is split between eight independent pieces of RNA, which allows pieces of RNA from different viruses to mix and form a novel type of virus as new virus particles are being assembled.[87] This new strain appears to be a result of the reassortment of two swine influenza viruses, one from North America and one from Europe.[88] But the North American pig strain was itself the product of previous reassortments, and has carried an avian PB2 gene for at least ten years and a human PB1 gene since 1993.[89] These genes were passed on to the new virus.[90][91]

Gene sequences for every viral gene were made available through the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID).[92][93] A preliminary analysis found that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses present in U.S. pigs since 1999, but the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein (M) genes resembled versions present in European swine flu isolates. While viruses with this genetic makeup had not previously been found to be circulating in humans or pigs, there is no formal national surveillance system to determine what viruses are circulating in pigs in the U.S.[94] So far, little is known about the spread of the virus in any pig population. A preliminary analysis has also shown that several of the proteins involved in the pathophysiology of the virus are most similar to strains that cause mild symptoms in humans. This suggests the virus is unlikely to cause severe infections similar to those caused by the 1918 pandemic flu virus or the H5N1 avian influenza.[95]

Late on May 6, 2009, Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory first completed the sequencing of Mexican samples of the virus, publishing the result to GenBank as A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009(H1N1).[96] This was later shown to be nearly identical to A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), the strain from California sequenced and published by the CDC on 27 April.[9] Samples from Mexico, Nova Scotia and Ontario had the same sequence, ruling out genetic explanations for the greater severity of the Mexican cases.[97][98]

The genetic divergence of the virus in samples from different cases has been analysed by an international collaboration who found that the virus jumped to humans in 2008, probably after June, and not later than the end of November.[11] The research also indicated the virus had been latent in pigs for several months prior to the outbreak, suggesting a need to increase agricultural surveillance to prevent future outbreaks.[20]

123,"The pneumococcal vaccine is very safe, although, like all vaccinations, it can cause side effects.

It's not possible to catch a pneumococcal infection from the vaccine, as the vaccine does not contain any live bacteria.

Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine in babies

Mild side effects of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which is the version of the pneumococcal vaccine given to babies under the age of 2, include:
• redness and swelling at the site of the injection
• feeling sleepy or not sleeping well

Serious side effects of the PCV vaccine are rare, and include:
• allergic reactions, such as an itchy skin rash

Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine in adults and older children

Mild side effects of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV), the version of the pneumococcal vaccine given to adults and children over the age of 2, include:
• mild soreness or hardness at the site of the injection lasting 1 to 3 days

More serious side effects of the PPV vaccine, such as allergic reactions, are rare.

What to do if your child is unwell after pneumococcal vaccination

Most common side effects in babies and young children, such as swelling or redness at the injection site, usually go away within a couple of days and you do not need to do anything about them.

If your child develops a fever, keep them cool. Make sure they do not wear too many layers of clothes or blankets, and give them cool drinks.

You can also give them a dose of infant paracetamol or ibuprofen liquid according to the instructions on the bottle.

Read an NHS leaflet about the common side effects of vaccination that may occur in babies and children (PDF, 118kb) under the age of 5, and how to treat them.

Very occasionally, a child or adult may have a serious allergic reaction after either type of pneumococcal vaccination.

Known as an anaphylactic reaction, this can cause life-threatening breathing difficulties.

Anaphylaxis is a rare, serious side effect that can happen within minutes of the injection. It's very alarming at the time, but it can be treated with adrenaline.

The doctor or nurse giving the vaccine will have been trained to know how to treat anaphylactic reactions.

Call your GP if you notice any unusual symptoms in your baby or yourself after being vaccinated.

• One in five Americans surveyed in a new AP-NORC poll said they'd refuse a coronavirus vaccine, and only about half said they would get such a vaccination, which scientists around the world are racing to create.
• The results were published Wednesday, the same day when the US reached a grim milestone of 100,000 deaths from the novel coronavirus.
• ""There's still a large amount of uncertainty around taking the vaccine,"" Caitlin Oppenheimer, the senior vice president of Public Health at NORC, told the Associated Press. ""There is a lot of opportunity to communicate with Americans about the value and the safety of a vaccine.""
• About seven in 10 of those who said they would get a coronavirus vaccine said they believed life would not return to normal without one.

A new poll published Wednesday found that about one in five Americans said they'd refuse a COVID-19 vaccine should one become available.

Only about half of respondents to the poll, conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, said they would get such a vaccine, while 31% said they were not yet sure whether they would get one.

The poll surveyed 1,056 adults and was conducted May 14-18. The results were released on the same day when the US reached a grim milestone of 100,000 deaths from the novel coronavirus, which causes the illness known as COVID-19.

""There's still a large amount of uncertainty around taking the vaccine,"" Caitlin Oppenheimer, the senior vice president of Public Health at NORC, told the AP. ""There is a lot of opportunity to communicate with Americans about the value and the safety of a vaccine.""

Experts have touted a COVID-19 vaccine as the solution to allowing the world to return to something resembling normality. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes vaccinations as ""one of the best ways to put an end to the serious effects of certain diseases.""

Respondents' uncertainty in this case, however, could have to do with the unprecedented circumstances surrounding COVID-19, which has prompted a worldwide race to condense a development process that normally takes several years into what scientists hope could be 12 to 18 months.

Melanie Dries, 56, from Colorado, told the AP she was not an anti-vaxxer but was concerned about getting a COVID-19 vaccine in the near feature, saying it ""causes me to fear that it won't be widely tested as to side effects.""

Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, told the AP in a previous interview that he ""would not want people to think that we're cutting corners because that would be a big mistake.""

""I think this is an effort to try to achieve efficiencies, but not to sacrifice rigor,"" he said, adding that ""definitely the worst thing that could happen is if we rush through a vaccine that turns out to have significant side effects.""

The Trump administration announced a vaccine-distribution program, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, meant to have 300 million doses in stock by January. The Department of Health and Human Services also promised earlier this week to provide ""up to $1.2 billion"" in funds to a laboratory at Oxford University working to develop a vaccine, The New York Times reported.

""It's always better to underpromise and overdeliver,"" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told the AP. ""The unexpected looms large, and that's why I think for any of these vaccines, we're going to need a large safety database to provide the reassurance.""

The AP-NORC poll found that 20% of Americans believed a coronavirus vaccine would be available to the public this year, with a majority saying it was more likely that a vaccine would be available next year.

About seven in 10 of those who said they would get the coronavirus vaccine said they believed life would not return to normal without one, with other top reasons for getting vaccinated including protecting themselves, their families, and the community.

""I'm definitely going to get it,"" Brandon Grimes, 35, from Austin, Texas, told the AP. ""As a father who takes care of his family, I think ... it's important for me to get vaccinated as soon as it's available to better protect my family.""",mainstream

American universities, pharmaceutical and other healthcare firms are being targeted by Chinese and Iranian hackers in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, according to reports.

The aggressiveness of the cyberattacks is such that some U.S. officials view them as tantamount to war, according to the Wall Street Journal, because they may have hurt research into a COVID-19 vaccine.

The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the cyber branch of the Department of Homeland Security, are expected to issue a “public service announcement” regarding China today, the Journal reports.

Iran, meanwhile, is suspected of targeting some of the same facilities, the report claims. Hackers linked to Iran reportedly targeted staff at U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences recently, according to Reuters.

“It is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to know what motivates such malfeasance, but any such activity carries with it the risk of triggering accidental, disruptive effects,” one senior administration official said.

A draft of the public warning will accuse China of seeking “valuable intellectual property and public health data through illicit means related to vaccines, treatments and testing,” according to the New York Times.

“China’s long history of bad behavior in cyberspace is well documented, so it shouldn’t surprise anyone they are going after the critical organizations involved in the nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told the Times.

China and the U.S. have been embroiled in a furious war of words since the coronavirus outbreak began, blaming one another for mishandling the pandemic.

611,"Scientists at Oxford University have begun clinical trials of a coronavirus vaccine that has shown promise in rhesus monkeys, according to news reports.

If the vaccine can effectively protect humans against the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, the first doses could potentially be administered by the autumn, according to a on the official trial's web page.

The vaccine is made up of a weakened version of a common cold virus called an adenovirus that causes infections in chimpanzees. But the virus has been genetically altered to make it ""impossible"" for the virus to grow in humans, . Then, they combined the weakened adenovirus with genes that code for the coronavirus ""spike"" protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect human cells.

In theory, the vaccine will train the body to recognize and develop an immune response to the spike protein, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus from entering human cells, according to the statement.

Similar vaccines — made from the same backbone, the weakened version of the chimpanzee adenovirus — have been given to more than 320 people to date and have been shown to ""be safe and well tolerated,"" aside from temporary side effects such as fever, headache and a sore arm, according to the statement.

The trials began on April 23, and up to 1,102 healthy participants will eventually be recruited in Oxford, Southampton, London and Bristol to take part. Half of the participants will receive the novel vaccine; most of those people will receive one dose of the vaccine, but 10 of those people will receive a second dose a month later. The other half of the participants will receive a ""control"" vaccine — already approved and given routinely to teenagers since 2015 — which protects against meningitis and sepsis.

The reason the researchers decided to use this control vaccine and not just a saltwater solution is so that participants won't be able to guess whether they received the actual vaccine. The researchers expect the novel coronavirus vaccine to cause temporary side effects such as sore arm, headache and fever, side effects that are also expected from the control vaccine but that wouldn't be expected from a saltwater solution.

The trial will last up to six months, with an optional visit one year after vaccination. ""The best-case scenario is that by the autumn of 2020, we could have an efficacy result from the phase III trial to show that the vaccine protects against the virus, alongside the ability to manufacture large amounts of the vaccine; but these best-case time frames are highly ambitious and subject to change,"" the researchers wrote in the blog post.

Of course, it's too early to tell whether or not the vaccine will work, but it has shown promise in rhesus monkeys, according to . Researchers gave the vaccine to six rhesus macaque monkeys at the National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Montana. Researchers then exposed them to high amounts of the coronavirus, according to the Times. More than 28 days later, all six monkeys were healthy.

Another vaccine, this one made from an inactivated form of the coronavirus, has also shown promise in monkeys in China, according to a . Researchers in China are now testing that vaccine on humans in clinical trials. More than 70 other vaccines are under development worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell below 25 percent compared to where it started this year and is now the poorest-performing major stock market in the world.

Then there is the trade war with the United States which wiped out a massive $2.4 trillion this year alone, while a deleveraging drive has pinched margin debt to just a third of its height in 2015.

As foreign investors continue to inject money into onshore equities via the stock connects and state funds in an attempt to rescue shares, the still didn't halt declines.

Even safer havens were losing ground as the weak Chinese economy hurt spending and weighed on consumer stocks.

Meanwhile, a vaccine scandal and gene-editing controversy prompted a massive sell-off in the health-care sector.

Here are six charts to sum up the year according to Bloomberg:

Stock declines have shaved $2.4 trillion off China’s market value this year as of Thursday, the biggest on record since Bloomberg started compiling the data in 2002.

The closest loss was during the global financial crisis ten years ago, when the Shanghai gauge plunged 65 percent.

China also ceded its place as the world’s second-biggest stock market to Japan earlier this year.

At least a dozen of these cold blooded killers were hired fresh out of prison, just 4 to 7 years after the Nuremberg trials found them guilty of mass murder and enslavement.

In fact, at the close of WWII, the IG Farben building in Frankfort was protected from allied bombings by the highest levels of military command. Why? IG Farben was the FDA/CDC type of “pharmaceutical arm” of Hitler’s 4th Reich, and the Rockefellers had a financial interest in maintaining and controlling this pharmaceutical empire, which would soon be catapulted on U.S. soil. Research reveals that Hitler also invested heavily in Merck and other pharmaceutical companies.

Nazi convicted mass murderers became executives for major U.S. chemical and pharmaceutical companies

Fritz ter Meer, found guilty of slavery and mass murder at Auschwitz, served only seven years in prison and became Chairman of the Board at Bayer in 1956. Still trust U.S. vaccines?

This is the same vaccine industry today which protected and employed Nazi war criminals. The very industry that produced the Nazi gas chambers was purchased by Bayer. So, exactly whom are you trusting with your children’s health and welfare?

Currently, the U.S. Government and the CDC rely solely on the manufacturers of vaccines to report problems, injuries and deaths. This atrocity is like letting murderers be their own judges in court! Where are the checks and balances this country was founded upon? Vaccines have economic and political agendas now, and the FDA does absolutely no testing of their own before making decisions to release vaccines to the masses.

Want more research before you or your child get injected with a new concocted disease for which there is no cure? Listen to stunning admissions by vaccine industry experts, including Dr. Maurice Hilleman (formerly w/Merck), who admitted to the deadly nature of the most trusted vaccines.

Today’s vaccines not only contain live versions of the diseases you DO NOT WANT, but also contain GMOs, hormones from infected cows, pigs, chickens and monkeys, untested virus combinations (like H1N1), aluminum, mercury, emulsifiers, and crossbred bacteria from animals, mosquitoes, and diseased humans:

Measles Live Virus Vaccine: (Attenuvax) Made by Merck. Two injections are given; one at 1 year and another at 4 years old. Contains gelatin, sorbitol, sodium chloride, bovine cow serum, egg protein and human albumin.

Measles and Mumps Live Virus Vaccine: (M-M-Rvax) Made by Merck. Injected into one year old babies. Contains gelatin, sorbitol, sodium chloride, bovine cow serum, and human albumin.

Diptheria, Tetanus and Polio Vaccine: Five injections given between 2 and 6 years of age, plus boosters “recommended” every 10 years. Contains formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol and aluminum phosphate.

DTaP, IPV, HBV and Hib*: (Diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B) Given to infants 2 to 12 months with boosters less than a year later. Contains aluminum hydroxide, formaldehyde, and bovine cow serum.

Gardasil HPV: Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Made by Merck. “Recommended” 3 intramuscular injections; given at birth, 2 and 6 months of age. Re-administered to children as young as 9 years of age for a rare sexually transmitted disease. Contains polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, aluminum, and a “denatured” (fragmented and weakened) form of the virus.
•Bovine cow serum: Extracted from cow skin. When injected causes connective tissue disorders, arthritis and lupus; also shortness of breath, low blood pressure, chest pain and skin reactions.
•Sorbitol: Synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues.
•Gelatin: Derived from the collagen inside animals’ skin and bones. Injecting gelatin poses the risk of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity (mad cow disease).
•Egg protein: Vaccines are prepared in eggs (certainly not organic). May contain growth hormones, antibiotics, and salmonella bacteria.
•Thimerosal: A neurotoxic mercury which causes autism: There are 25 mcg in one average flu vaccine, and the EPA safety limit is 5 micrograms, so children who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple* vaccines receive over 10 times the safety limit of mercury in one day.
•Human albumin: The protein portion of blood frompooled human venous plasma; when injected causes fever, chills, hives, rash, headache, nausea, breathing difficulty, and rapid heart rate. Injecting “pooled blood” can result in a loss of body cell mass and cause immunodeficiency virus infection, or contain SV40, AIDS, cancer or Hepatitis B from drug addicts.
•Formaldehyde: Highly carcinogenic fluid used to embalm corpses. Ranked one of the most hazardous compounds to human health; can cause liver damage, gastrointestinal issues, reproductive deformation, respiratory distress and cancer. Plus, formaldehyde has been known to fail todeactivate the virusthe vaccine is intended to cure, thus enabling a live virus to enter your blood and infect your system.
•Phenoxyethanol: A glycol ether/chemical; highly toxic to the nervous system, kidneys, and liver. The FDA warns “can cause shut down of the central nervous system (CNS), vomiting and contact dermatitis” in cosmetics; imagine when injected into your blood.
•Aluminum phosphate: Greatly increases toxicity of mercury, so caution aboutminimum mercury toleranceis therefore severely underestimated. CDC scientists and all doctors are well aware of this.
•MSG(monosodium glutamate): When injected becomes a neurotoxin, causing CNS disorders and brain damage in children.

If you especially enjoy being lied to, visit vaccinateyourbaby.org, where they tell you formaldehyde is safe because it is “present in the environment and is a byproduct of metabolism, so it is already present in the human body.” They also inform you that aluminum is good for you, because “[a]luminum is also commonly found in food, water, infant formula and even breast milk.” Hey, if it’s in the environment, it must be safe to inject into your veins (so why not use snake venom, bleach, and plutonium?).

927,"A first-of-its-kind analysis of more than 1300 Facebook pages with nearly 100 million followers has produced a network map that’s alarming public health professionals. Antivaccine pages have fewer followers than pro-vaccine pages but are more numerous, faster growing, and increasingly more connected to undecided pages, the study finds. If the current trends continue, the researchers predict, antivaccine views will dominate online discussion in 10 years—a time when a future vaccine against COVID-19 may be critical to public health.

“The reds are winning,” says anthropologist Heidi Larson, who directs the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, referring to the color of antivaccine Facebook pages on the new paper’s map. “They are covering a lot more ground with fewer of them.”

The online pages are “a battle for hearts and minds, and there was no map of that battlefield at the system level,” says first author Neil Johnson, a data scientist at George Washington University who previously mapped the online behavior of hate groups and the Islamic State group. “We set out to take a look at that. And we were shocked.”

For their study, Johnson and his colleagues first identified Facebook pages as pro- or antivaccine based on their content. They further identified engaged but undecided pages by their content or by the fact that the administrators of the pages had “liked,” or been “liked” by, pro- or antivaccine pages. They found 124 pro-vaccine pages, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with a combined total of 6.9 million followers. They found 317 antivaccine pages, such as RAGE Against the Vaccines, with a total of 4.2 million followers. And they identified 885 pages, such as Breastfeeding Moms in KY, with 74.1 million followers.

The researchers next counted each page’s links to other vaccine-discussing pages, and those pages’ links to still others, a method called snowball sampling. A software program turned the data into a map in which pages are represented as circular nodes, sized proportionally to their number of followers and represented as red (antivaccine), blue (pro-vaccine), or green (undecided). Highly connected nodes occupy more central places on the map.

The map shows many central red nodes intensely interacting with many greens. A smaller number of blue nodes interact with greens at a peripheral nexus removed from the central “battlefield,” as the researchers call it in this week’s issue of Nature. The analysis found that antivaccination pages are both locally and globally connected, whereas pro-vaccine pages are largely global or national.

In percentage terms, red pages grew their follower numbers notably more than did blue pages during the study period of February to October 2019, which coincided with a global measles outbreak. Red pages’ connectedness and influence also grew more than those of blue pages. (Total followers of all pages have since grown by millions.)

“The blues are fighting in the wrong place, they are off to one side and the main activity is around the reds which are absolutely entangled with this whole slew of green communities,” Johnson says.

Blue and red pages also engage followers differently, says Larson, who was not part of the research. Pro-vaccine groups impart information on one theme with one goal: getting people vaccinated, she notes. By contrast, the study found that antivaccine groups comprise multiple smaller groups discussing a wide range of health and safety topics. That makes them more responsive to diverse concerns and makes undecided people feel listened to, Larson says. “It’s like we as a public health community still have the old IBM model and not the startup Silicon Valley approach. … The reds have got that down.”

Pro-vaccine pages “seem to be in an echo chamber and their preaching doesn’t seem to go any further than the choir,” agrees Bruce Gellin, president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute.

Sinan Aral, an econometrician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has mapped the online spread of misinformation, praises the analysis’s large size. But he advises a “skeptical eye.” He says it’s not clear that a green page’s linking to a red page leads to persuasion or that online interactions trigger actual changes in vaccination. He adds that the predicted online dominance of red groups in 10 years “is extrapolating a lot from … limited data.”

The study only looks at how people’s views circulate, not the content of pages, “as if people don’t have reasons for their views and are only being manipulated,” says another critic, Bernice Hausman, a cultural theorist at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. She calls the paper’s battlefield rhetoric “troublesome,” arguing that it betrays the very mindset—casting vaccine resisters as the enemy—that turns the vaccine skeptical away.

But Johnson stands by his terminology. He concedes that the map is a first, imperfect attempt, but says, “Because we are looking at the system level, the main results of our study are robust.”",mainstream
1157,"An Oxford University vaccine considered likely to come online this year may not be available to British people first, its lead scientist has suggested.

Prof Sarah Gilbert, whose team is receiving UK Government funding, said on Sunday that it is focused on providing protection against the virus ""as widely as possible across the world"".

Human trials for the vaccine are due to start this week, and Prof Gilbert has previously said she is 80 per cent confident it will work, and that a million doses could be available by September.

However, asked twice by Andrew Marr whether British people would be first in the queue for it, she said: ""There are discussions going on about mechanisms for ensuring fair access to all vaccines that work at a global level.""

Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, on Sunday moved to temper public expectations, saying: ""All new vaccines that come into development are long shots. Only some end up successful. Coronavirus will be no different and presents new challenges. This will take time.""",mainstream
119,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci says the government is working on several potential vaccines for COVID-19.

“We have many candidates and hope to have many winners,” he told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee. “In other words, it is many shots on goal.”

Despite the rapid pace of work on vaccines, Fauci was offering no guarantees. He says, “The big unknown is efficacy.”

Fauci heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is the government’s leading expert on the pandemic. He says he hopes to have a vaccine in advanced trials by late fall or early winter.

1300,"A large dog roamed about the house; a very tall son watched an English soccer match; and Wakefield, while making coffee and emptying the dishwasher, continued to bat away charges. He claimed, for example, that a “safer” measles vaccine for which he filed a patent was not, in fact, a rival to M.M.R., which would have been a clear conflict of interest; it was instead an immune-boosting vaccine for those with compromised immune systems, an unfortunate semantic mix-up. (“He is very good at what I call whack-a-mole arguments,” says Seth Mnookin, author of “The Panic Virus,” a history of the controversy over autism and vaccines.)

Wakefield is a persuasive speaker, even when the listener knows better. As we talked, I couldn’t help thinking of a clip of Wakefield I saw on YouTube. The video showed him at a conference in 1999, telling the audience about the time he lined up kids to give blood samples at the birthday party of one of his children: he needed a control group of children who did not have autism, and this was convenient. “Two children fainted,” he said. “Another threw up over his mother.” For their service, they were rewarded with £5. “People said to me, ‘Andrew, you know you can’t do this to people; children won’t come back,’ ” he recounted. “I said, ‘You’re wrong — listen, we live in a free-market economy; next year, they’ll want £10.’ ”

Clearly, drawing blood in that setting was part of no medical protocol that an ethics committee would ever approve. The General Medical Council, in its ruling against Wakefield, said that by engaging in this behavior, he displayed conduct that “fell seriously short of the standards expected of a doctor and was a breach of the trust that the public is entitled to have in members of the medical profession” and deemed the episode “serious professional misconduct.”

Wakefield was either naïve or arrogant to think that he could joke on camera about the lengths to which he had gone in the pursuit of proving his theories right. But what is also striking about that video is the sound of the audience laughing. He had won over a room full of parents, who were caught up in the charm of a maverick. It was hard to imagine Wakefield making such a joke now; he has not retreated from his position, but he has shifted his sense of identity from that of a renegade to that of a martyr. He often says that he has stuck by a theory that “has cost me my job, my livelihood and my country.” The more he has sacrificed, the more he must believe in his theory — or else what was it all for? A quote from Peter Medawar, a British scientist who wrote a famous critique of a book of specious ideas about evolution, comes to mind: “Its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself.”

Wakefield continues to work with a sense of mission and an entrepreneurial savvy. Since leaving Thoughtful House, he has been working on a book about parents who have been falsely accused of Munchausen syndrome by proxy: the world of false accusations, of unheard parents in pain — familiar territory, all of it. He is also trying to raise money for a center for autistic adults. It is a shrewd business move with explosive potential for growth: 80 percent of the autistic population in the U.S. is currently under 18.

That morning in Austin, Wakefield was on his way to yet another contentious interview in New York, this one with George Stephanopoulos. His son, who drove Wakefield and me to the airport, had no plans to follow in the footsteps of his parents and his paternal grandparents, all of whom were doctors: he was majoring in public relations and marketing instead. Perhaps his father’s experience had taught him something about the perils of science and about the power of messaging.

It seems very unlikely that any study, no matter how carefully conducted, will assure Wakefield of the safety of M.M.R. at this point: numbers can lie, or be manipulated, and even paranoids have enemies. Didn’t they laugh at the researcher who said bacteria caused ulcers? Doesn’t he owe it to the children to continue on?

Before leaving for the airport with Wakefield and his son, I took in the view from the deck. The hills looked lofty, peaceful, a little bit blurred in the distance — you could believe, as Wakefield had promised, you were in Tuscany. With a little effort, you can believe almost anything.",mainstream
563,"“He told me he has a number of friends who are affected,” Mr. Kennedy said of the conversation with the president-elect, describing 2-year-old children who had received “a battery” of vaccines and then exhibited a high fever followed by changes in behavior. “They all have the same story.”

Mr. Kennedy said Mr. Trump “believes in those anecdotal stories” about the dangers of vaccines. He said the president-elect “says if you have enough anecdotal stories saying the exact same thing, that you can’t dismiss the validity.”

He said a commission would probably last a year and be made up of “a mix of science people and other people hopefully from the media and other prominent Americans who hopefully don’t have a position going in.”

Mr. Kennedy wrote a book in 2014, “Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak,” arguing that a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal, found in vaccines, was responsible for causing autism in children. On his website, he accuses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of being a “cesspool of corruption, mismanagement and dysfunction” that has led the agency to overlook the affects of vaccines.

“With the research, regulatory and policy-making agencies captured, the courts closed to the public, the lawyers disarmed, the politicians on retainer and the media subverted, there is no one left to stand between a greedy industry and vulnerable children, except parents,” Mr. Kennedy wrote.

Such claims have been fueled over the past several years by social media, sometimes embraced by actors or fringe political candidates, often to the dismay of public health officials, who say the commentary is contrary to the facts.

The actress Kirstie Alley has written on Twitter that not all vaccines are harmless. Erin Brockovich, an environmental activist, wrote on the site in 2015, “I’ll be damned if any government is going to tell me what to put in my or kids’ bodies.” In 2011, Michele Bachmann, then a member of Congress from Minnesota and a Republican presidential candidate, called the vaccine to prevent cervical cancer “dangerous.”",mainstream
999,"America does not necessarily elect her politicians for their scientific savvy. So when the issues of the day require a grasp on science, politicians' statements can get a little weird. Here are six examples of politicians who have stumbled over science.

Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo) is in hot water with the public — and his own political party — for claiming that pregnancy from ""legitimate rape"" is rare because ""the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.""

Akin's views, which he has since recanted, are extremely non-scientific. Pregnancy requires sperm and egg, and it doesn't matter how the two meet.

Rick Santorum's ""Tell that to a plant.""

> Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum is an avid denier of global warming, decrying warnings of climate change as a hoax. In one of his more memorable comments, Santorum scoffed at fears of carbon emissions in a speech at the Gulf Coast Energy Summit in Biloxi, Miss.

""The dangers of carbon dioxide?"" Santorum said on March 12, 2012. ""Tell that to a plant, how dangerous carbon dioxide is.""

Santorum is not alone in his use of the ""carbon is not dangerous"" talking point. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) has downplayed human carbon emissions arguing that carbon dioxide is ""natural,"" and saying, ""life on planet Earth can't even exist without carbon dioxide."" [Busted! 10 Climate Change Myths]

Plants do require carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. But what's the saying about too much of a good thing? In fact, too much CO2 can actually decrease photosynthesis in some plants, according to a 1985 study published in the journal Photosynthesis Research. Overdosing on CO2 can also prevent some grasses, including wheat, from taking up nitrate, a crucial nutrient for plant growth, according to research published in the journal Science in 2010.

More importantly, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat in our atmosphere. As such the gas can be very dangerous if it means an increase in global average temperatures that melt ice caps, raise sea levels and cause more extreme weather events.

After a Republican debate in September 2011, then-presidential nominee hopeful Rep. Michele Bachmann went on Fox News and NBC with an anecdote warning against Gardasil, a vaccine that protects against a virus that can cause cervical cancer.

""There’s a woman who came up crying to me tonight after the debate,"" Bachmann told Fox's Greta Van Susteren. ""She said her daughter was given that vaccine. She told me her daughter suffered mental retardation as a result of that vaccine. There are very dangerous consequences.""

Bachmann's comments reflect anti-vaccine notions found on both the political right and left, but they don't appear to reflect reality. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) keep a national database of adverse vaccine reactions. For Gardasil, the most common problems are fainting (from the jab), pain and redness at the site of the injection, and dizziness, nausea and headache. There have not been reports of mental retardation caused by the vaccine.

Christine O'Donnell and the mice with human brains

Sometimes, political science-gaffes spring from misremembered news bites. That seems to be the case for Christine O'Donnell, a Tea Party favorite who, during an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor in 2007, made a strange case against cloning and stem-cell research.

""American scientific companies are cross-breeding humans and animals and coming up with mice with fully functioning human brains,"" O'Donnell said. ""So they're already into this experiment.""

Not quite. It seems the research O'Donnell was referring to was a 2005 study in which fetal mice were injected with human embryonic stem cells. The mice were born with human brain cells in their skulls, but certainly not human brains — and there was no ""cross-breeding"" involved. The mouse brains were more than 99 percent mouse cells, and the interloping neurons did not change the rodents' behavior. The ultimate goal of the study was to develop stem-cell treatments for neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

Are breast implants good or bad for you? Don't ask Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.). During a 2005 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about class-action lawsuits, Coburn brought up lawsuits related to silicone breast implants.

""I thought I would share with you what science says today about silicone breast implants,"" the Washington Post quotes Coburn saying. ""If you have them, you're healthier than if you don't. That is what the ultimate science shows. … In fact, there's no science that shows that silicone breast implants are detrimental and, in fact, they make you healthier.""

It's not entirely clear what health benefits Coburn was referring to, though SourceWatch, a website run by the Center for Media and Democracy, suggests that perhaps he meant to reference a 2005 study published in the journal Breast Cancer Research that found that women who got breast implants after mastectomy from early-stage cancer had less risk for later breast cancer mortality than women who did not get them. The women with implants were younger and less likely to have disease that had spread than the women who did not get the implants, however. [Cleavage Countdown: 8 Facts About Breasts]

According to the National Cancer Institute, there is no association between breast implants and later breast cancer. The center did not, however, report any health benefits for a boob job.

During the presidential campaign of 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama struggled with the science of vaccines and autism. At a rally in Pennsylvania, Obama told the crowd, ""We've seen just a skyrocketing autism rate. Some people are suspicious that it's connected to the vaccines … The science right now is inconclusive, but we have to research it.""

While Obama avoided touting a link between vaccines and autism, his statement on ""inconclusive"" research doesn't pass muster. There is no evidence that vaccines cause autism, despite multiple studies that attempted to find such a link. In fact, the study that first touted this link was retracted in 2010 by the journal The Lancet, after an independent council concluded that the study was fatally flawed. For example, the 12 children in the study were cherry-picked by the researchers rather than being an arbitrary sample of patients as the paper had claimed.",mainstream

LONDON: Pharma giant AstraZeneca struck a deal Saturday with Europe's Inclusive Vaccines Alliance to supply up to 400 million doses of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine , as efforts to boost manufacturing capacity continue at pace.The alliance, which was forged by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands to speed up production of a vaccine, is set to take delivery of the vaccine being tested by the University of Oxford by the end of 2020. The agreement with AstraZeneca also aims to make the vaccine available to other European countries that wish to take part.The cost is expected to be offset by funding from the governments.""This agreement will ensure that hundreds of millions of Europeans have access to Oxford University's vaccine following approval,"" AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said. ""With our European supply chain due to begin production soon, we hope to make the vaccine available widely and rapidly.""The agreement is the latest in a series to make the vaccine - even though it is not certain it will work. But so desperate is the need that scaling up of manufacturing continues despite the risk.The Anglo-Swedish company recently completed similar agreements with Britain, the United States the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance for 700 million doses. A license also has been agreed with the Serum Institute of India for another 1 billion doses.The vaccine was developed by Oxford University's Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group Testing of the experimental COVID-19 vaccine began in healthy volunteers in Britain in April with over 1,000 people aged 18 to 55.

This causes the immune system, specifically the white blood cells , to produce complementary antibodies , which target and attach to the antigen. When a white blood cell engulfs and digests a pathogen it is called phagocytosis.

During the primary infection the antibodies slowly increase, peak at around ten days and then gradually decrease. A second exposure to the same pathogen causes the white blood cells to respond quickly in order to produce lots of the relevant antibodies, which prevents infection.",mainstream
1035,"People keep asking me when I think a vaccine against ­coronavirus will be available. It’s the one breakthrough we’re waiting for to get life back to normal.

It’s the magic word that puts us in control of the spread of Covid-19, giving us immunity and ensuring the R value would always be under 1.

Then at last we could move around more freely – visiting friends and family, using public transport, returning to work. Ending lockdown.

Well, Elisabeth Mahase has done a status report in the BMJ on where we stand on the development of a vaccine. And the news is encouraging.

Robin Shattock, who is leading a trial set to begin in June at Imperial College London, said developing a vaccine should be relatively easy because, unlike influenza and HIV, the Covid-19 virus seems to be relatively stable.

He says scientifically there is a very high chance of success.

Vaccine development is a lengthy process that normally takes more than 10 years and costs hundreds of millions of pounds.

For Covid-19 we’re trying to compress the whole process into months. Once the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it must then pass the regulatory requirements and gain approval for general use.

Even once this is completed, the scaling up and manufacturing of the end result on a large scale is complex and expensive.

For a vaccine to be rolled out ­worldwide, requiring billions of doses, global manufacturing capacity has to start from scratch.

New production sites need to be built before clinical trials are completed to ensure it could begin being distributed as soon as approval is given.

The sites should be located around the world to ensure equitable distribution.

Ohid Yaqub, senior lecturer at the University of Sussex’s Science Policy Research Unit, warned that “there is a long history of over-optimistic vaccine predictions”.

And he said even if a vaccine became available, it’s “too early even to speculate whether it will have high efficacy or low efficacy”.

Mr Yaqub added: “I therefore think public policy attention should continue to focus on testing and on healthcare system capacity, and it should focus on lockdown and managing the social costs of (partial) lockdown for as long as possible.”

I’m not sure I agree with that. We’ve been caught on the hop more than once with this virus. At all costs we should avoid lack of preparedness to ­manufacture a vaccine on a large scale.",mainstream
205,"In the American political system, lobbying is par for the course. It has come to be expected that major industries, and the leading corporations in those industries, will seek to influence legislation, regulation, and the enforcement of government decisions, such that they receive preferential treatment. This could come in the form of campaign contributions, or actual lobbying, with a lobbyist working on behalf of the corporation that has paid them to influence a particular vote or governmental decision. What it is they are lobbying for, though, is a more involved question.

Here, using data from opensecrets.org, we break down lobbying efforts, industry by industry, combining all political contributions and lobbying spending from Jan. 1998 to March 31, 2020. Figures are calculations by the Center for Responsive Politics based on data from the Senate Office of Public Records.

Let's take a closer look at how much each industry spends on lobbying, the top corporate spenders in each category, and what spurs their lobbying efforts.

Spending $4.45 billion over the past 22 years, the pharmaceutical and health products industry has far outpaced all other industries in lobbying spending. It's important to note that this industry includes not only drug manufacturers, but also the sellers of medical products and nutritional and dietary supplements. From Jan. 2020 through March 2020, spending was topped by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Pfizer Inc.

Overall, the industry is primarily concerned with ""resisting government-run health care, ensuring a quicker approval process for drugs and products entering the market, and strengthening intellectual property protections.” In recent years, lobbying has focused more specifically “on the patent system, research funding, and Medicare.” As is to be expected, lobbying efforts reached a fever pitch in 2009, around the drafting of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and reported a high in 2017 with legislative enactments again focusing on changes to health care.

Including health, property, and car insurance companies, along with agents and brokers, the insurance industry has historically been the second most generous/aggressive industry in lobbying for their interests. In 2019, spending was $155.3 million. Following the passage of the ACA and subsequent developments under the Trump administration, health insurance companies have been very involved in the legislative process, looking to influence new regulations. In 2019, the leading insurance industry lobbyist corporation was Blue Cross/Blue Shield.

The electric utilities industry monitors legislative and regulatory action taken on a number of fronts, including clean air regulation, waste storage, cybersecurity, and infrastructure. The top lobbyist in electric utilities as of March 2020 is Duke Energy.

These are your classic software and hardware computer tech companies, some of the founders of the tech movement that exists today. As this industry has become increasingly profitable, its political contributions have increased. The industry is relatively non-partisan, usually given to each party evenly, with slight favoring to the party in the White House.

Given the ubiquity of hardware and software, and tech more generally, it makes sense that lobbying from the electronics sector is varied, with lobbying efforts on homeland security, taxes, copyright, immigration, human rights, cybersecurity, and law enforcement data storage. As of March 2020, the top lobbying spenders were Qualcomm Inc and Microsoft Corp.

This grouping includes small business, pro-business, and international trade associations, as well as chambers of commerce. Business associations lobby on issues like labor regulations, intellectual property, product safety, and taxes, but mostly, lobbying efforts have focused on civil justice system reform.

Business associations want to make sure that damages awarded to plaintiffs involving torts or wrongful acts that led to legal liabilities are limited (asbestos, medical malpractice, etc.). Other important legal issues include business tax reform, including corporate tax policy and taxation of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies. The top business association lobbyist in 2019 was the U.S Chamber of Commerce.

As you might imagine, the oil and gas lobbying sector is one of the most active lobbying groups. Lobbyist efforts have historically focused on promoting legislators with pro-energy views in the areas of fossil fuel production, commodity exploration, and extraction. As of March 2020, the top lobbying spenders in the industry were Chevron Corp, Koch Industries, and Exxon Mobil.

With spending of nearly $1.9 billion in lobbying efforts over the past 22 years, miscellaneous manufacturing and distributing is an influential force in legislation and governmental regulation. The sector has members like Honeywell International, General Electric, Cummins Inc., 3M, and Procter & Gamble, and its lobbying interests and efforts reflect this wide array. Having spent $3.4 million from Jan. 2020 through March 2020, the National Association of Manufacturers is the industry’s top lobbyist.

This category includes all healthcare institutions—hospitals, nursing homes, hospice providers, and drug and alcohol inpatient centers. Lobbying in this industry was especially active in 2009 and again in 2017 with legislative actions involving health care and the Affordable Care Act.

At present, lobbyist efforts in the sector are generally focused on cost management, insurance allocations, spending on employee training, prevention of physician pay reductions, and costs associated with Medicaid and Medicare. The leading spender from Jan. 2020 through March 2020 was the American Hospital Association, with $7.2 million.

Political contributions and lobbying efforts from the education industry come mostly from individual educators or administrators, as educational institutions are not usually able to form political action committees (PACs). Areas of interest for educators and education lobbyists include the federal budget (allocations for research money, programs, and student aid) and student loans, and specifically the Student Loan Fairness Act, which prevented student loans from doubling when the congressional agreement expired. Lobbyists in the education sector spent $82.2 million in 2019 with the Association of American Medical Colleges coming in as a top spender.",mainstream
1271,"When the parents of Hannah Poling, a nine-year-old, Athens, Ga., girl who was diagnosed with autism just after the age of two, announced that a federal vaccine injury court had awarded them a settlement, the case reignited a decade-old debate about whether vaccines could potentially trigger the disorder. But what was somewhat lost in much of the coverage of the case was a little-known condition that the court said was aggravated by the vaccine, and which gave Hannah the features of autism.

 

 That little known condition—""mitochondrial disorder""—involves the parts of cells frequently referred to as their ""power plants,"" because they turn sugar into energy. Mitochondria are found in all tissues and organs in the body, and when they do not work properly they can cause or worsen diseases from diabetes to brain disorders. Jay Gargus, a specialist in human genetics and metabolism at the University of California, Irvine, says mitochondrial disorders are a bit like an electrical brownout: ""As the electrical voltage starts falling, different appliances will start to fail,"" he says. ""First, the television might turn off, then the lights might go off.""

 

 In July 2000, at 19 months of age, Poling received five vaccines containing nine immunizations—including inoculations against rubella (German measles), mumps and chicken pox. The girl had been developing normally, according to her parents—her father, Jon, is a Johns Hopkins–trained, practicing neurologist, her mother is an attorney and registered nurse—but in the months after the shots, she developed a fever and litany of other symptoms: diarrhea, appetite loss and intermittent screaming. A pediatric neurologist examining her in February 2001 later noted that she had lost some of the speech she had previously acquired, was no longer making eye contact, and was no longer sleeping through the night. 

 

 In its November 2007 decision the vaccine court said that the inoculations Poling received in July 2000 worsened her underlying mitochondrial disorder (which was discovered nearly a year later) and led to brain disease that appeared as symptoms of autism.

 

 Theoretically, that makes sense: David Holtzman, a pediatric neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, notes that the brain is particularly dependent on the energy supplied by the mitochondria. ""What's surprising and hard to specifically understand is why it's so characteristically affecting language function and social function,"" he adds. (In addition to symptoms of autism, Poling also reportedly had muscle weakness, difficulty with motor coordination, and a host of gastrointestinal problems.)

 

 So how common are mitochondrial disorders? Could they explain why some children who receive vaccines develop autism, but the vast majority do not?

 

 In an opinion piece in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Poling's father cited a 2005 study by a Portuguese research team that estimates as many as one in five kids diagnosed with autism also have a mitochondrial disorders. He notes that such a rate ""does not qualify as 'rare.' In fact, mitochondrial dysfunction may be the most common medical condition associated with autism.""

 

 Hannah's disorder is likely due to a rare mutation in her DNA. Most of the DNA responsible for mitochondria is inherited from mothers, because mitochondrial genes are carried in the egg but not sperm. Salvatore DiMauro, a mitochondria expert at Columbia University, notes that the point mutation mentioned in Poling's case history--published in the Journal of Child Neurology--would imply that both she and her mother carried the genetic variation in all their tissues. So, he says, ""you would expect to see the same results"" in both the mother and the daughter. But Poling's mother, Terry, who is an attorney and a registered nurse, is not autistic.

 

 That suggests the genetic defect responsible for Poling's condition is part of her nuclear DNA, which is separate from the mitochondrial variety, says DiMauro. This means that, scientifically, from the documents presented in the vaccine court, the Polings did not make a case that deserved compensation. (Attempts to contact Jon Poling about DiMauro's concern went unanswered; however, he agreed that his daughter's causative genetic defect was likely not in her mitochondrial DNA in an open letter on the blog NeuroLogica.)

 

 John Shoffner, a mitochondrial disease expert who runs a laboratory in Atlanta, agrees. In at study of 40 patients with autism—including Poling, he found that two thirds had muscle weakness. If muscle weakness is seen early on in children, it may be a tip-off to an underlying mitochondrial disorder that could cause autism, because muscles are heavily dependent on mitochondria as an energy source. He also believes that the new work—he presented preliminary results last week at the American Academy of Neurology Conference in Chicago—will help explain why some children, such as Poling, experience worsening symptoms as a result of a fever.

 

 He notes that the route from the vaccine to the child's autism was by no means direct. Hannah's mitochondria were already underperforming, so when she developed a fever from her vaccine, the increased energy requirements likely pushed them past their thresholds. A fever caused by an ear infection or the flu would likely have triggered the autism symptoms if they occurred before or between the ages of 24 and 36 months, he says, which is when classic, regressive autism, which affects one third of sufferers, usually appears.

 

 Shoffner notes that parents and advocates looking to impugn vaccines as triggers for autism—or mitochondrial disease—need direct, not just circumstantial, evidence. ""If you were sitting in a waiting room full of people and one person suddenly fell ill or died or something,"" he says, ""would you arrest the person sitting right next to them?""

Jon Poling, says Shoffner, has been ""muddying the waters"" with some of his comments. ""There is no precedent for that type of thinking and no data for that type of thinking,"" Shoffner says.",mainstream
349,"What’s going on in the fifth largest economy in the world arguably points to a major collusion scandal in which the French government is helping Big Pharma to profit from the expansion of Covid-19. Informed French citizens are absolutely furious about it.

My initial question to a serious, unimpeachable Paris source, jurist Valerie Bugault, was about the liaisons dangereuses between Macronism and Big Pharma and especially about the mysterious “disappearance” – more likely outright theft – of all the stocks of chloroquine in possession of the French government.

Respected Professor Christian Perronne talked about the theft live in one of France’s 24/7 info channels: “The central pharmacy for the hospitals announced today that they were facing a total rupture of stocks, that they were pillaged.”

With input from another, anonymous source, it’s now possible to establish a timeline that puts in much-needed perspective the recent actions of the French government.

Let’s start with Yves Levy, who was the head of INSERM – the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research – from 2014 to 2018, when he was appointed as extraordinary state councilor for the Macron administration. Only 12 people in France have reached this status.

Levy is married to Agnes Buzy, who until recently was minister of health under Macron. Buzy was essentially presented with an “offer you can’t refuse” by Macron’s party to leave the ministry – in the middle of the coronavirus crisis – and run for Mayor of Paris, where she was mercilessly trounced in the first round on March 16.

Levy has a vicious running feud with Professor Didier Raoult – prolific and often-cited Marseille-based specialist in communicable diseases. Levy withheld the INSERM label from the world-renowned IHU (Hospital-University Institute) research center directed by Raoult.

In practice, in October 2019, Levy revoked the status of “foundation” of the different IHUs so he could take over their research.

Raoult was part of a clinical trial in which hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin healed 90% of Covid-19 cases if they were tested very early. (Early, massive testing is at the heart of the successful South Korean strategy.)

Raoult is opposed to the total lockdown of sane individuals and possible carriers – which he considers “medieval,” in an anachronistic sense. He’s in favor of massive testing (which, besides South Korea, was successful in Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam) and a fast treatment with hydroxychloroquine. Only contaminated individuals should be confined.

Chloroquine costs one euro for ten pills. And there’s the rub: Big Pharma – which, crucially, finances INSERM, and includes “national champion” Sanofi – would rather go for a way more profitable solution. Sanofi for the moment says it is “actively preparing” to produce chloroquine, but that may take “weeks,” and there’s no mention about pricing.

On January 13, Agnes Buzyn, still France’s Health Minister, classifies chloroquine as a “poisonous substance,” from now on only available by prescription. An astonishing move, considering that it has been sold off the shelf in France for half a century.

On March 16, the Macron government orders a partial lockdown. There’s not a peep about chloroquine. Police initially are not required to wear masks; most have been stolen anyway, and there are not enough masks even for health workers. In 2011 France had nearly 1.5 billion masks: 800 million surgical masks and 600 million masks for health professionals generally.

But then, over the years, the strategic stocks were not renewed, to please the EU and to apply the Maastricht criteria, which limited membership in the Growth and Stability Pact to countries whose budget deficits did not exceed 3% of GDP. One of those in charge at the time was Jerome Salomon, now a scientific counselor to the Macron government.

On March 17, Agnes Buzyn says she has learned the spread of Covid-19 will be a major tsunami, for which the French health system has no solution. She also says it had been her understanding that the Paris mayoral election “would not take place” and that it was, ultimately, “a masquerade.”

What she does not say is that she didn’t go public at the time she was running because the whole political focus by the Macron political machine was on winning the “masquerade.” The first round of the election meant nothing, as Covid-19 was advancing. The second round was postponed indefinitely. She had to know about the impending healthcare disaster. But as a candidate of the Macron machine she did not go public in timely fashion. 



In quick succession:

The Macron government refuses to apply mass testing, as practiced with success in South Korea and Germany. 



Le Monde and the French state health agency characterize Raoult’s research as fake news, before issuing a retraction.

Professor Perrone reveals on the 24/7 LCI news channel that the stock of chloroquine at the French central pharmacy has been stolen.

Thanks to a tweet by Elon Musk, President Trump says chloroquine should be available to all Americans. Sufferers of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, who already have supply problems with the only drug that offers them relief, set social media afire with their panic.

US doctors and other medical professionals take to hoarding the medicine for the use of themselves and those close to them, faking prescriptions to indicate they are for patients with lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.

Morocco buys the stock of chloroquine from Sanofi in Casablanca.



Pakistan decides to increase its production of chloroquine to be sent to China.

Switzerland discards the total lockdown of its population; goes for mass testing and fast treatment; and accuses France of practicing “spectacle politics.” 



Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, having had himself treated with chloroquine, without any government input, directly calls Sanofi so they may deliver chloroquine to Nice hospitals. 



Because of Raoult’s research, a large-scale chloroquine test finally starts in France, under the – predictable – direction of INSERM, which wants to “remake the experiments in other independent medical centers.” This will take at least an extra six weeks – as the Elysee Palace’s scientific council now mulls the extension of France’s total lockdown to … six weeks.

If joint use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin proves definitely effective among the most gravely ill, quarantines may be reduced in select clusters.

The only French company that still manufactures chloroquine is under judicial intervention. That puts the chloroquine hoarding and theft into full perspective. It will take time for these stocks to be replenished, thus allowing Big Pharma the leeway to have what it wants: a costly solution.

It appears the perpetrators of the chloroquine theft were very well informed.

This chain of events, astonishing for a highly developed G-7 nation proud of its health service, is part of a long, painful process embedded in neoliberal dogma. EU-driven austerity mixed with the profit motive resulted in a very lax attitude towards the health system.

As Bugault told me, “test kits – very few in number – were always available but mostly for a small group connected to the French government [ former officials of the Ministry of Finance, CEOs of large corporations, oligarchs, media and entertainment moguls]. Same for chloroquine, which this government did everything to make inaccessible for the population.

They did not make life easy for Professor Raoult – he received death threats and was intimidated by ‘journalists.’

And they did not protect vital stocks. Still under the Hollande government, there was a conscious liquidation of the stock of masks – which had existed in large quantities in all hospitals. Not to mention that the suppression of hospital beds and hospital means accelerated under Sarkozy.”

This ties in with anguished reports by French citizens of nurses now having to use trash bags due to the lack of proper medical gear.

At the same time, in another astonishing development, the French state refuses to requisition private hospitals and clinics – which are practically empty at this stage – even as the president of their own association, Lamine Garbi, has pleaded for such a public service initiative: “I solemnly demand that we are requisitioned to help public hospitals. Our facilities are prepared. The wave that surprised the east of France must teach us a lesson.”

Bugault reconfirms the health situation in France “is very serious and will become even worse due to these political decisions – absence of masks, political refusal to massively test people, refusal of free access to chloroquine – in a context of supreme distress at the hospitals. This will last and destitution will be the norm.”

In an explosive development on Tuesday, Raoult said he’s not participating in Macron’s scientific council anymore, even though he’s not quitting it altogether. Raoult once again insists on massive testing on a national scale to detect suspected cases, and then isolate and treat patients who tested positive. In a nutshell: the South Korean model.

That’s exactly what is expected from the IHU in Marseille, where hundreds of residents continue to queue up for testing. And that ties in with the conclusions by a top Chinese expert on Covid-19, Zhang Nanshan, who says that treatment with chloroquine phospate had a “positive impact,” with patients testing negative after around four days.

The key point has been stressed by Raoult: Use chloroquine in very special circumstances, for people tested very early, when the disease is not advanced yet, and only in these cases. He’s not advocating chloroquine for everyone. It’s exactly what the Chinese did, along with their use of Interferon.

For years, Raoult has been pleading for a drastic revision of health economic models, so the treatments, cure and therapies created mostly during the 20th century, are considered a patrimony in the service of all humanity.“That’s not the case”, he says, “because we abandon medicine that is not profitable, even if it’s effective. That’s why almost no antibiotics are manufactured in the West.”

On Tuesday, the French Health Ministry officially prohibited the utilization of treatment based on chloroquine recommended by Raoult. In fact the treatment is only allowed for terminal Covid-19 patients, with no other possibility of healing. This cannot but expose the Macron government to more accusations of at least inefficiency – added to the absence of masks, tests, contact tracing and ventilators.

On Wednesday, commenting on the new government guidelines, Raoult said, “When damage to the lungs is too important, and patients arrive for reanimation, they practically do not harbor viruses in their bodies any more. It’s too late to treat them with chloroquine. Are these the only cases – the very serious cases – that will be treated with chloroquine under the new directive by [French Health Minister] Veran?” If so, he added ironically, “then they will be able to say with scientific certainty that chloroquine does not work.”

Raoult was unavailable for comment on Western news media articles citing Chinese test results that would suggest he is wrong about the efficacy of chloroquine in dealing with mild cases of Covid-19.

Staffers pointed instead to his comments in the IHU bulletin. There Raoult says it’s “insulting” to ask if we can trust the Chinese on the use of chloroquine. “If this was an American disease, and the president of the United States said, ‘We need to treat patients with that,’ nobody would discuss it.”

In China, he adds, there were “enough elements so the Chinese government and all Chinese experts who know coronaviruses took an official position that ‘we must treat with chloroquine.’ Between the moment when we have the first results and an accepted international publication, there is no credible alternative among people who are the most knowledgeable in the world. They took this measure in the interest of public health.”

Crucially: if he had coronavirus, Raoult says he would take chloroquine. Since Raoult is rated by his peers as the number one world expert in communicable diseases, way above Dr. Anthony Fauci in the US, I would say the new reports represent Big Pharma talking.

Raoult has been mercilessly savaged and demonized by French corporate media that are controlled by a few oligarchs closely linked to Macronism. Not by accident the demonization has reached gilets jaunes (yellow vest) levels, especially because of the extremely popular hashtag #IlsSavaient (“They knew”), with which the yellow vests stress that French elites have “managed” the Covid-19 crisis by protecting themselves while leaving the population defenseless against the virus.

That ties in with the controversial analysis by crack philosopher Giorgio Agamben in a column published a month ago, where he was already arguing that Covid-19 clearly shows that the state of exception – similar to a state of emergency but with differences important to philosophers – has become fully normalized in the West.

Agamben was speaking not as a doctor or a virologist but as a master thinker, following in the steps of Foucault, Walter Benjamin and Hannah Arendt. Noting how a latent state of fear has metastasized into a state of collective panic, for which Covid-19 “offers once again the ideal pretext,” he described how, “in a perverse vicious circle, the limitation of freedom imposed by governments is accepted in the name of a desire for security that was induced by the same governments that now intervene to satisfy it.”

There was no state of collective panic in South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam – to mention four Asian examples outside of China. A dogged combination of mass testing and contact tracing was applied with immense professionalism. It worked. In the Chinese case, with the help of chloroquine. And in all Asian cases, without a murky profit motive to the benefit of Big Pharma.

There hasn’t yet appeared the smoking gun that proves the Macron system not only is incompetent to deal with Covid-19 but also is dragging the process so Big Pharma can come up with a miracle vaccine, fast. But the pattern to discourage chloroquine is more than laid out above – in parallel to the demonization of Raoult.",conspiracy
1023,"Vacctivist is a blend of vaccine and activist, coined to mock the anti-vaccination (anti-vaxx) movement. Anti-vaxxers broadly believe vaccines cause humans more harm than good—such as the discredited claim that vaccines cause autism, a position notably taken up by model and personality Jenny McCarthy in the late 2000s. This belief has compelled a number of parents not to vaccinate their children, leading to a rash of diseases like measles there were virtually eradicated.

The term vacctivist was apparently coined in 2008 by Greg Allen on his blog for new fathers, Daddy Types, in his post, “DT Friday Freakout: The Vacctivists Aren’t Gonna Like This Edition.” This roundup exposes the lack of causation between autism and vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). Its use of vacctivist is jab at people who don’t vaccinate their children—and are proud and preachy about it.

Daddy Types continued to use the phrase vacctivist throughout the 2010s. However, some anti-vaxxers embraced vacctivist for their cause, either as a reclamation of the insult or as independent coinage. For instance, in 2017, anti-vaxxer Guggie Daley wrote an article for Natural Mother, “Vacctivism Technology: How to Empower Instead of Cower,” about how to more effectively promote anti-vaxx messages.

Backlash against the anti-vaxx movement, though, led to a more prevailing sense of vacctivist: someone who advocates—based on science and for the public good—for getting vaccines. This vacctivist is pro-vaxx, as it were.",mainstream
1250,"In 1981, a young man visited Cedars-Sinai hospital, in Los Angeles, with shortness of breath and with curious purplish lesions on his skin. After reviewing biopsies and scans, a twenty-eight-year-old medical resident named David Ho found an odd fungal infection in the patient’s lungs and a rare cancer, Kaposi’s sarcoma. These conditions were both associated with immune deficiency, though nothing in the patient’s history explained why he would be in such a state. He was given antibiotics and discharged; not long after, he died. Over a few months, Ho and his colleagues saw five men with similar symptoms. They wrote up the cases and sent them to the Centers for Disease Control—the first report of what became known as AIDS.

Ho continued to explore the disease. “Some people were very concerned that I was so intrigued by those few cases at the very beginning of my career,” he told me. “ ‘Why would you want to devote your career to an esoteric disease?’ ” Particularly one that seemed mainly to afflict what was considered a fringe population—gay men. But Ho, who had emigrated from Taiwan when he was twelve, speaking no English, had an underdog mentality and would not be dissuaded.

He made several discoveries throughout the nineteen-eighties about H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and in 1990, at the age of thirty-seven, he moved to New York to become the director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center. A year later, he received a call asking him to fly back to L.A. to test a very important patient. There, he confirmed that Earvin (Magic) Johnson was H.I.V.-positive. The following week, Johnson disclosed his condition and announced that he was retiring from the N.B.A. Ho has cared for him ever since. Johnson later said that he’d never thought AIDS would kill him, because Ho had assured him that better medicines were in the pipeline. In 1994, Ho found that a certain class of drugs could dramatically reduce the viral load in AIDS patients. But, within each infected individual, the virus evolved quickly, evading treatments. One drug was not enough. His team devised the idea of an AIDS “cocktail”—a combination of three or four drugs that, acting in concert, could corner the virus. In 1996, Time named Ho its Man of the Year.

In November, 2002, a novel disease broke out in China: severe acute respiratory syndrome, caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV. Ho was asked by China’s top public-health officials to advise them. “The most dramatic memory I have is going to Beijing, arriving in the late afternoon or early evening, and going to the hotel along the biggest avenue,” he recalled. “If you remember the Tiananmen incidents of many years ago, with the protester and the tank, that’s the boulevard. It has ten or twelve lanes. There was only the car that’s driving me and one ambulance for as far as one could see.”

He went on, “That’s when I got interested in coronaviruses, serving as a consultant and seeing the devastation firsthand in several cities throughout China.” Back in New York, Ho began investigating the coronavirus family. Some coronaviruses can produce lethal diseases, like SARS; others are among the causes of the common cold. But, he said, “the SARS epidemic ended in July of 2003. By the next year, there was hardly any interest. Funding for that area kind of dried up. So we simply dropped it and went on with our H.I.V. work.” In 2012, another coronavirus, MERS-CoV, caused an outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula; Middle East respiratory syndrome, as it was called, sickened more than twenty-five hundred people and killed more than eight hundred. Ho followed it with interest, but this outbreak, too, passed quickly. Then, this past December, a disease with similar symptoms flared up in China and, within a month, was linked to another coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Ho told me, “My Chinese heritage caused me to focus more on the news coming out of China in late December and early January. However, the experience with SARS also put a pause on our natural reaction to jump in and get involved.” His attitude shifted when the story did. “It was the growing magnitude of the outbreak that told us, ‘Oh, we’d better think about getting into this,’ ” he said.

Ho was just setting up his lab at its new home, at Columbia University. He is friendly with Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, who asked how he could help. In February, Columbia announced that Ma’s foundation had awarded a $2.1-million grant to Ho and several Columbia colleagues to develop antiviral drugs. This project was prompted by the COVID-19 crisis, but the mission goes beyond it; the researchers are thinking not only about the current pandemic but about future ones as well.

What will the next global pathogen be? “If you’d asked me that three or four months ago, I would have said influenza,” Ho told me, with a chuckle of dismay. For scientists, this isn’t just a thought experiment; it’s the sort of question that shapes years of research. Two years ago, a team at Johns Hopkins issued a report titled “The Characteristics of Pandemic Pathogens,” which was based on a literature review, interviews with more than a hundred and twenty experts, and a meeting devoted to the issue. It grimly considered the possibilities.

Could bacteria do us in? Outbreaks of plague have wreaked havoc throughout history, but the development of effective antibiotics in the past century “took bacteria off the table as a global biological risk for the most part,” Amesh Adalja, a physician at Johns Hopkins and the report’s project director, told me. Bacteria can evolve, and develop drug resistance, but usually not quickly. How about fungi? They threaten some species, but don’t adapt well to warm-blooded hosts (and may have helped encourage the evolution of warm-bloodedness). Prions? These are responsible for mad-cow disease and its human variant, but are mostly avoidable by preventing food contamination and refraining from cannibalism. Protozoa? Malaria has killed perhaps half of all humans who have ever lived. But protozoa are typically transmitted by vectors such as mosquitoes and fleas, which are limited by climate and geography. Viruses, the report concluded, are the real menaces.

Not just any viruses, though. The likeliest candidates are those with a genome of RNA, which evolve faster than those with DNA. Viruses that spread before symptoms appear also have a considerable advantage. (The only infectious disease we’ve wiped out, smallpox, is not contagious during the incubation period.) And the most daunting are those transmitted by respiration, rather than by feces or bodily fluids, which can be controlled through sanitation. Viruses that can move between animals and humans are especially hard to manage. All in all, this character sketch gets us pretty close to identifying two classes of viral assailants: influenzas and coronaviruses.

None of our off-the-shelf treatments equip us for such a pandemic. If bacteria invade, there’s a long list of antibiotics you can try. Between ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin, we can treat dozens of different types of bacterial infection. For the roughly two hundred identified viruses that afflict us, there are approved treatments for only ten or so. And the antiviral drugs that exist tend to have narrow targets. Only a few have been approved for use against more than one disease. Many drugs that work on one virus don’t work on others within the same family; antivirals suited for some herpesviruses (such as the one that causes chicken pox and shingles) aren’t suited for others. Some antivirals can’t even treat different strains of the same virus.",mainstream
1348,"Brain scans, analyzed using a type of artificial intelligence, can reveal whether 6-month-old babies are likely to develop autism, a new study shows.

The study examined 59 infants who were at high risk of developing autism; that is, each had an older sibling with autism. The artificial intelligence predicted with 100 percent accuracy that 48 infants would not develop autism. In addition, of the 11 infants who did develop the disorder by the time they were 2 years old, the system correctly predicted nine of the cases.

""It was extremely accurate,"" Robert Emerson, the lead author on the study and a former cognitive neuroscience postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina (UNC), told Live Science. [5 Things That May Cause Autism]

Studies show that 20 percent of babies who have older siblings with autism will develop the disorder; among babies in the general population, 1.5 percent develop autism, Emerson told Live Science.

The results of the new research could lead to new diagnostic tools that identify autism before symptoms occur, giving clinicians the opportunity to intervene early, the researchers said.

""The idea is that we can be more effective if we can get to these kids before they develop autism, perhaps ameliorating or preventing it,"" Dr. Joseph Piven, a professor of psychiatry at the UNC School of Medicine and director of the Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities, told Live Science. The researchers published their results today (June 7) in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Autism spectrum disorder, a brain-based disorder characterized by a wide range of social-communication challenges and repetitive behaviors, affects about one out of every 68 children in the United States. Behavioral symptoms typically begin to appear in children at around age 2.

Emerson and his colleagues demonstrated that they could identify biomarkers for the disorder before the symptoms occur.

As part of their study, the researchers used MRI scanners to image the brains of the infants while they slept. During the scans, the researchers recorded the neural activity of 230 different regions in the brain, looking particularly at whether or not pairs of these region — referred to as functional connections — were synchronized with each other, and if so, to what extent.

In total, the researchers measured 26,335 functional connections crucial for cognition, memory and behavior.

When the children reached age 2, they came back in for a behavior assessment. The researchers looked at the children's social interactions, communication, motor development and tendency to perform repetitive actions, and determined whether each child had autism. [11 Facts Every Parent Should Know About Their Baby's Brain]

With all of the data in hand, the researchers set out to first train their machine learning program, and then use it to run predictions. They wanted to see how accurately it could predict which infants had developed autism, using only the functional connections data from when the children were 6 months old. In other words, although the researchers knew which babies had developed into toddlers with autism and which had not, the machine learning program did not.

Machine learning is a kind of artificial intelligence system that gets smarter based on the data it processes. In this case, the program was learning to spot differences between the functional connections imaged in the MRI data collected at 6 months old that correlate with cognition, memory and behavior and the details from the behavioral assessments collected at 24 months.

As the program did this, it separated the children into two groups — those with autism and those without the condition. Once it was trained, it could make predictions. [7 Baby Myths Debunked]

But during the training process, the researchers didn't use the data from all 59 kids. Instead, they fed data in from 58 of the 59 infants to train the model, and then to get the prediction, they inputed the data from the one infant they had left out. They repeated this for all 59 children.

""Each child was predicted separately based on a model from the other children in the group,"" Emerson said.

In the end, the machine learning program was correct in 82 percent of the cases in which the children did develop autism.

Piven said the team published a study earlier in the year that also showed an impressive prediction rate, but that study required two MRI scans, one at 6 months of age and one at 1 year. Moving the needle to an earlier age is a big advance, Piven said.

The research team was amazed by the parents who participated in this and other studies over the years, given all that was required, he said.

""This is an extraordinary group of people,"" Piven said. ""Not only do they have an older child with autism, but they bring their babies, often multiple times and from very far away, to one of our four clinical sites around the country.""

The researchers said they hope their contributions will lead to more effective interventions for children on the brink of developing autism.",mainstream
536,"Almost £7bn has been raised to immunise 300 million children at a virtual global vaccine summit hosted by the UK.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said up to eight million lives would be saved as a result of the funds pledged at the Gavi vaccine summit on Thursday.

The money will help immunise children against diseases like polio, diphtheria and measles over five years.

Mr Johnson said the triumph of humanity over disease was the ""greatest shared endeavour of our lifetimes"".

The summit raised funds for Gavi, a global alliance of public and private sector organisations promoting vaccination among the world's poorest communities.

Pledges by more than 50 countries and individuals like billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates saw the total surpass an initial target of $7.4bn (almost £6bn).

Mr Gates donated $1.6bn (£1.3bn) from his foundation and Mr Johnson pledged £1.65bn over the next five years, making the UK the organisation's biggest donor.

The summit comes as the world continues to struggle to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr Johnson also used the conference to urge world leaders to renew their ""collective resolve"" to find a Covid-19 vaccine.

""Just as we have great military alliances like Nato... where countries collaborate on building their collective military defence, so we now need that same spirit of collaboration and collective defence against the common enemy of disease,"" he said.

""It will require a new international effort to co-operate on the surveillance and the sharing of information - data is king - that can underpin a global alert system, so we can rapidly identify any future outbreak. And it will mean a radical scaling-up of our global capacity to respond.""

International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan later said she believed the UK was capable of delivering a coronavirus vaccine to those who need it ""at speed"" when one becomes available.

US President Donald Trump made a surprise appearance at the virtual global vaccine summit.

Last week, Mr Trump severed ties with the UN's health agency, the World Health Organization, stopping around $400m (£317m) in support, after accusing it and China of mishandling the outbreak.

There was international criticism of the decision, particularly because it was made in the middle of a global pandemic.

But at the summit, Mr Trump struck a different tone in what was a very brief and seemingly very off-the-cuff, pre-recorded message.

""As the coronavirus has shown, there are no borders, it doesn't discriminate,"" he said.

""It's mean, it's nasty but we're going to take care of it together.... We will work hard, we will work strong... good luck, let's get the answer.""",mainstream
1085,"● World Economic Forum honours 25 Young Scientists under the age of 40 in recognition of their contribution to cutting-edge research

Geneva, Switzerland, 26 May 2020 – The World Economic Forum today announces its Class of 2020 Young Scientists, representing 25 exceptional researchers at the forefront of scientific discovery.

Recognition of the Young Scientists comes at a time when the need for evidence-based policy has never been clearer. Although the challenge of COVID-19 has unintentionally diverted attention away from other research work – despite the pressing global issues that these efforts address – the need for science to test, predict and explain how different phenomena affect human and ecological outcomes is greater than ever. The Young Scientists were nominated by leading research institutes according to criteria including research excellence, leadership potential and commitment to serving society.

These brilliant academics, 40 and under, have been selected on the basis of their achievements in expanding the boundaries of knowledge and practical applications of science in issues as diverse as child psychology, chemical oceanography and artificial intelligence.

Eight of this year’s Young Scientists study in Europe, while seven work in Asia, six are based in the Americas, two in South Africa and a further two in the Middle East. Fifteen – more than half – of the 25 Young Scientists are women.

“We are looking forward to working with the Class of 2020 Young Scientists to help leaders from the public and private sector better engage with science and in doing so, help young researchers become stronger ambassadors for science, which the world needs now and will continue to need post-COVID-19,” said Alice Hazelton, Programme Lead, Science and Society, World Economic Forum.",mainstream
503,"The U.S. government alone spends $200 million a year on a hunt for a vaccine against AIDS. At the forefront of that search stands Dr. David Baltimore, chairman of the National Institute of Health's AIDS Vaccine Research Committee. Currently president of the California Institute of Technology as well, Baltimore won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Betsey Arledge, producer of the NOVA film ""Surviving AIDS,"" interviewed a cautiously optimistic Baltimore on the current state of the search for a vaccine.



 

 NOVA: Can you give me a sense of the magnitude of the AIDS epidemic at this time?



 Baltimore: The AIDS epidemic in this country is a serious issue, but it's not a major public health disaster the way it is abroad. In the world today there are something like 34 million infected people, and more people are being infected every minute. On the scale of any public health issue in the world, this is one of the major ones. There are more people dying of AIDS than of almost any other infectious disease, with tuberculosis and malaria being in the same ballpark. It's a horrendous situation. (See AIDS in Perspective.)



 NOVA: Do you think we're getting a little complacent in this country?



 



 Baltimore: I'm impressed that AIDS remains a very noted disease in the United States. It's noted in the newspapers all the time—what's going on in the world and in the country. There is very complete coverage of how good the drugs are and where the vaccine program stands. I don't think we've allowed it to fall off the radar screen. And we do far more AIDS research than the whole rest of the world; in the vaccine area alone, we do probably 90 percent of the research.



 NOVA: Can you give me a sense of the amount of effort—not just money, but intellectual effort—that has gone into trying to find a vaccine over the past 10 or 15 years?



 



 Baltimore: When H.I.V. was first discovered, the first thing that the then-Secretary of what became the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said was, ""We will have a vaccine in short order."" She was wrong about that, but it shows that from the very first moment a vaccine was on people's minds. Indeed, there has been a significant effort to make a vaccine from the very first day. I think people thought it would be simple, because we'd made vaccines for so many different viruses.



 The polio vaccine is effective because, for the most part, our bodies naturally fight this virus. This is not the case with HIV. The thing that worried me at the time—and it has turned out to be the biggest worry—was that if it were possible to make a vaccine, why doesn't the body ordinarily fight off the virus? Most viruses we fight off very well, including polio and even smallpox. A certain fraction of people may be maimed or killed by those viruses, but the much larger fraction of people get over them. That's not true for H.I.V. We knew that from very early on.



 



 At first we thought it might be that many people would be killed by it, and then we began to realize that almost everybody who had the infection was potentially going to be killed by it. That's fundamentally different than other viruses. And that fundamental difference was a red flag. The initial impetus that we'd be able to do it, it's around the corner, was just all wrong.



 NOVA: So the search for a vaccine has been a real struggle?



 Baltimore: It's been an enormous struggle, because the obvious things didn't work, and people got very frustrated by that. The next question became: Where do you turn? What's not obvious? What can we do? That involved bringing a whole different level of people into the discussion. Not the ordinary people who make vaccines, but people whose scientific focus is in other areas of immunology, of infectious disease—basic scientists. So it's been a ramping up process to get more and more people involved and thinking about it.



 Perhaps the most important role of the committee I'm now heading is to galvanize the scientific community to find new routes in thinking about a vaccine, so that maybe we can find a vaccine through some very non-traditional approach.



 NOVA: An international team of scientists announced recently that they had traced the origin of the AIDS virus to a subspecies of chimpanzee in Africa. If this report is verified, how will it help in the search for a vaccine?



 Baltimore: In truth, it will not have much effect on the search for a vaccine. However, it tells us a lot about why HIV is so hard to counter. It is not a virus that is native to the human species, and therefore it is continually mutating in an effort to adapt. Most human viruses are well-controlled by the human immune system, because they have evolved with it, and the two opposing forces are in a steady-state. We cannot wait until we and HIV evolve to being comfortable with each other. We must devise a vaccine, effectively short-circuiting the usual process of adaptation.



 NOVA: Who are the so-called long-term non-progressors, and how do they fit into the search?



 Bob Massie is a long-term non-progressor. His immune system's ability to fight HIV is inspiring a new approach to fighting AIDS. Baltimore: There is a small group of H.I.V.-infected people—maybe five percent—who don't get any symptoms and whose virus is maintained at a very low level. If we could find out the secret behind that, maybe we could replicate it in a vaccine. So far we haven't found the secret, but there are good correlations. These people have a good cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, they have a good helper T cell response. [Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, otherwise known as CTLs or CD8 killer T-cells, are cells involved in immune defense that can kill other cells infected by viruses. So-called CD4 helper T cells are essential for triggering antibody production, activating CTLs, and initiating other immune responses.] So that says if we can make those a focus of activity, maybe we can design a vaccine around those principles. But there's no certainty that those are the key issues.



 



 There is a balance of three things: whether the virus that those people have is different than the virus other people have; whether their immune system is somehow responding to it differently than other people's immune systems are; and whether their genetics are different. Are they inherently able to fight the virus? Or is it something that's learned and that therefore we could teach other people to do?

323,"[Note: This is Part VI in a series of articles adapted from the second Children’s Health Defense eBook: Conflicts of Interest Undermine Children’s Health. The first eBook, The Sickest Generation: The Facts Behind the Children’s Health Crisis and Why It Needs to End, described how children’s health began to worsen dramatically in the late 1980s following fateful changes in the childhood vaccine schedule.]

A concerted and “heavy-handed” effort is under way to censor information that contradicts the oversimplified sound bites put forth by public health agencies and the media about vaccines. However, while brazen, in-your-face censorship—and attacks on health freedom—have ratcheted up to an unprecedented degree, officialdom’s wish to keep vaccination’s unflattering track record out of the public eye is nothing new.

There is a chasm between vaccine rhetoric and reality for most if not all vaccines, but four vaccines—varicella (chickenpox), rotavirus, human papillomavirus (HPV) and pertussis-containing vaccines—offer especially instructive before-and-after case studies. Analysis of the U.S. experience with these vaccines raises important questions. First, why did the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) race to approve—and why does the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) heavily promote—vaccines such as varicella and rotavirus when there is little public health justification for them? Second, why are federal agencies ignoring the many serious risks that have surfaced in the vaccines’ wake—problems unheard of before the vaccines’ introduction?

The rationale for the varicella and rotavirus vaccines was dubious from the start. In the U.S. and other wealthy countries, varicella and rotavirus were nearly universal and mostly benign childhood infections; in those settings, the pre-vaccine impact of the two conditions was largely measured in terms of “healthcare costs, missed daycare, and loss of time from work for parents/guardians” rather than in terms of serious illness or mortality.

Childhood chickenpox infections served an important purpose for all, conferring lifelong immunity to infected children while boosting adult immunity to the related shingles (herpes zoster) virus. With the rollout of mass varicella vaccination, shingles started cropping up to an unprecedented extent in both children and adults, eliminating boosting for adults and shifting downward the average age at which shingles occurs. Vaccine waning also began increasing young adults’ risk for varicella outbreaks and complications later in life, presenting “perverse public health implications.” Meanwhile, the CDC and its local public health partners worked hard to conceal these unwanted chickenpox vaccine outcomes from the public.

Rotavirus vaccines have had a similarly checkered history. Soon after their introduction in the U.S., reports emerged of a substantially increased risk in infants of an otherwise rare bowel complication called intussusception. The FDA knew about the problem during the prelicensing regulatory review process but ignored it. Although the agency subsequently withdrew its approval for one of the problematic rotavirus vaccines, it was not until after an estimated 500,000 children received at least one million doses. The FDA never explained the “precise mechanism” by which the discontinued vaccine caused intussusception.

Two rotavirus vaccines that display the same intussusception risks are still on the U.S. market. Both are contaminated with foreign DNA from porcine viruses capable of causing severe immunodeficiency in pigs. Had the presence of these “adventitious agents” been discovered prior to vaccine licensure, the FDA probably would have been forced to shelve the vaccines, yet they remain on the vaccine schedule to this day.
• Nine years later: HPV vaccine injury survivor is still recovering

The HPV vaccines Gardasil and Gardasil-9 (manufactured by Merck) represent perhaps an even more compelling case study of risk-laden vaccines that should have attracted strong up-front regulatory scrutiny—but didn’t. The speed with which the FDA gave them the go-ahead—despite obvious red flags regarding their safety—illustrates the insincerity of the agency’s assertions that its vaccine approval process is committed to minimizing risks.

The FDA not only gave the quadrivalent Gardasil a free pass but has repeatedly reapproved it and the nine-valent Gardasil-9 for wider use. (Gardasil-9 is a newer formulation that contains more than twice the amount of neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant as Gardasil.) In 2009, the FDA also okayed GlaxoSmithKline’s HPV vaccine, Cervarix, but Merck’s FDA-facilitated stranglehold on the market prompted the company to withdraw Cervarix from the U.S. in 2016. Merck is now aggressively expanding its Gardasil “franchise” into other countries, generating unprecedented worldwide demand, while continuing to “rev up” U.S. sales.

Since 2006, the FDA’s Gardasil-related decisions have included:
• 2006: Granting fast-tracked approval for the original quadrivalent Gardasil vaccine (girls and women aged 9 to 26 years)
• 2009: Approving Gardasil’s use in boys and men (ages 9-26)

An eight-month investigation by Slate identified numerous troubling aspects of the clinical trials that encouraged U.S. and European regulators to approve Gardasil. The Slate reporter also criticized regulators for allowing “unreliable methods to be used to test the vaccine’s safety.” These included Merck’s use of “a convoluted method” that made it difficult to objectively evaluate and report side effects; its failure to document “symptom severity, duration, outcome, or overall seriousness”; restriction of adverse event reporting to just 14 days following each injection; and reliance on the subjective opinion of clinical trial investigators regarding “whether or not to report any medical problem as an adverse event.” Not infrequently, clinical trial participants who shared complaints of debilitating symptoms with trial investigators were dismissed with the response, “This is not the kind of side effects we see with this vaccine.”

Two years after Gardasil’s initial approval, Judicial Watch pronounced it a “large-scale public health experiment.” Post-licensure studies carried out since then confirm that HPV vaccines have grave risks, including impaired fertility, demyelinating disease, chronic limb pain, circulatory abnormalities and autoimmune illness, to name just some of the disabilities reported in the aftermath of HPV vaccines’ introduction. Overall, the “rate of reported serious adverse reactions (including deaths) from HPV vaccination” is many times higher than the cervical cancer mortality rate.

In a February 2019 letter to the CDC, Children’s Health Defense Chairman Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. noted, “During Gardasil’s clinical trials, an extraordinary 49.5% of the subjects receiving Gardasil reported serious medical conditions within seven months of the start of the clinical trials. Because Merck did not use a true placebo in its clinical trials, its researchers were able to dismiss these injuries as sad coincidences.” A current civil case brought on behalf of a 24-year-old who has suffered from systemic autoimmune dysregulation since receiving her third Gardasil vaccine at age 16 alleges that Merck “committed fraud during its clinical trials and then failed to warn [vaccine recipients] about the high risks and meager benefits of the vaccine.” The trial’s legal team is benefiting from the support of an “A-team” of plaintiffs’ law firms and attorneys, including Kennedy, Jr.

Recent data suggest that HPV vaccines may be increasing cervical cancer risks. A 2017 study out of Australia—which has heavily promoted routine HPV vaccination since 2007—reported an increased risk of difficult-to-detect malignant cervical lesions among the HPV-vaccinated. In all countries where HPV vaccination coverage is high, including Australia, official cancer registries show “an increase in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer” in the vaccinated age groups. In England, “2016 national statistics showed a worrying and substantial increase in the rate of cervical cancer…at ages 20-24”—the first HPV-vaccinated cohort.

The proper decision would be to take HPV vaccines off the market, but the FDA and CDC continue to look the other way. Both agencies’ unwavering support for Gardasil has clearly helped Merck’s commercial bottom line, so much so that the CDC director at the time of Gardasil’s approval (Julie Gerberding) went on to be appointed president of Merck’s profitable vaccine division (worth $5 billion globally) in 2009. The agencies’ willingness to aggressively promote HPV vaccination despite its readily apparent dangers illustrates a “public health flimflam” of the first order. Before the U.S. introduction of HPV vaccination, a decades-long pattern of declining cervical cancer rates was already well underway, thanks to routine cervical cancer screening. HPV vaccines have never even been proven to prevent cervical cancer. In 2016, researchers admitted that they would be unable to ascertain HPV vaccines’ long-term efficacy for “at least another 15-20 years.”

Alongside their many misplaced claims about various vaccines’ rationale and safety record, the FDA and CDC—as echo chambers for the vaccine industry—also have misinformed the public about vaccine effectiveness. Back in 1899, doctor William Bailey (vaccination enthusiast and member of the State Board of Health in Louisville, Kentucky) was more honest, cautioning that “nothing is gained by claiming too much” about vaccine-induced immunity and stating that “the degree of immunity may vary with time and circumstance”—presaging the troublesome modern phenomena of vaccine failure and waning immunity. In the present day, officials are only too willing to “claim too much,” conveniently ignoring historical evidence that reductions in infectious disease had little to do with vaccines and far more to do with improvements in sanitation and nutrition. Officials also seem to have little interest in modern evidence documenting many vaccines’ inability to provide the promised protection, even when vaccine coverage is widespread.

The acellular version of pertussis (whooping cough)—a component of U.S. vaccines such as DTaP and Tdap—is one of the vaccines noted for its abysmal effectiveness. The vaccine is supposed to protect against the respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. Instead, according to recent studies, pertussis is making a “surprising” comeback; between 1990 and 2005, pertussis epidemics increased in the U.S. “in both size and frequency,” and over half of all cases occurred in highly vaccinated adolescents aged 10 to 20 years old. In fact, not only is pertussis at its highest level since the mid-1950s, but, according to CDC researchers, it is showing signs of being vaccine-resistant. The CDC researchers also note “substantial heterogeneity among vaccine recipients in terms of the durability of the protection they receive.”

West Africa has used the DTP vaccine since the 1980s—formulated with a whole-cell pertussis component instead of acellular pertussis—and it has an even more horrifying safety and effectiveness record than its acellular counterparts. Research published in 2017 by a prestigious team of international scientists and led by vaccinology expert Dr. Peter Aaby found that DTP vaccination had a negative effect on child survival, with fivefold higher mortality in young DTP-vaccinated infants (ages three to five months) compared to as-yet-unvaccinated infants. When the researchers published results in 2018 for slightly older DTP-vaccinated children (ages six months to three years), they continued to observe more than double the risk of death as similarly situated unvaccinated children. Explaining that vaccines can increase susceptibility to other infections, the researchers concluded in 2017 that “all currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis” and added in 2018 that “all studies of the introduction of DTP have found increased overall mortality.”

Efforts to counter the official vaccine narrative with evidence about negative consequences date back to the days of smallpox. A doctor practicing in the 1870s observed that smallpox mortality doubled (from roughly 7% to 15%) after adoption of smallpox vaccination. During an outbreak in 1871 and 1872, this doctor stated, faith in vaccination received a “rude…shock” when “[e]very country in Europe was invaded with a severity greater than had ever been witnessed during the three preceding centuries.” The doctor also noted that “many vaccinated persons in almost every place were attacked by small-pox before any unvaccinated persons took the disease.” In this individual’s estimation, these facts were “sufficient to overthrow the entire theory of the protective efficacy of vaccination.”

In the present era, federal agencies continue to tout difficult-to-justify but money-spinning vaccines as beneficial, even in the face of substantial evidence to the contrary. Now, more than ever, it is important to illuminate the risks and downsides that public health agencies do not want us to know about.

354,"The agents of infection can be divided into different groups on the basis of their size, biochemical characteristics, or manner in which they interact with the human host. The groups of organisms that cause infectious diseases are categorized as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.

Bacteria can survive within the body but outside individual cells. Some bacteria, classified as aerobes, require oxygen for growth, while others, such as those normally found in the small intestine of healthy persons, grow only in the absence of oxygen and, therefore, are called anaerobes. Most bacteria are surrounded by a capsule that appears to play an important role in their ability to produce disease. Also, a number of bacterial species give off toxins that in turn may damage tissues. Bacteria are generally large enough to be seen under a light microscope. Streptococci, the bacteria that cause scarlet fever, are about 0.75 micrometre (0.00003 inch) in diameter. The spirochetes, which cause syphilis, leptospirosis, and rat-bite fever, are 5 to 15 micrometres long. Bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics.

Bacterial infections are commonly caused by pneumococci, staphylococci, and streptococci, all of which are often commensals (that is, organisms living harmlessly on their hosts) in the upper respiratory tract but that can become virulent and cause serious conditions, such as pneumonia, septicemia (blood poisoning), and meningitis. The pneumococcus is the most common cause of lobar pneumonia, the disease in which one or more lobes, or segments, of the lung become solid and airless as a result of inflammation. Staphylococci affect the lungs either in the course of staphylococcal septicemia—when bacteria in the circulating blood cause scattered abscesses in the lungs—or as a complication of a viral infection, commonly influenza—when these organisms invade the damaged lung cells and cause a life-threatening form of pneumonia. Streptococcal pneumonia is the least common of the three and occurs usually as a complication of influenza or other lung disease.

Pneumococci often enter the bloodstream from inflamed lungs and cause septicemia, with continued fever but no other special symptoms. Staphylococci produce a type of septicemia with high spiking fever; the bacteria can reach almost any organ of the body—including the brain, the bones, and especially the lungs—and destructive abscesses form in the infected areas. Streptococci also cause septicemia with fever, but the organisms tend to cause inflammation of surface lining cells rather than abscesses—for example, pleurisy (inflammation of the chest lining) rather than lung abscess, and peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane lining the abdomen) rather than liver abscess. In the course of either of the last two forms of septicemia, organisms may enter the nervous system and cause streptococcal or staphylococcal meningitis, but these are rare conditions. Pneumococci, on the other hand, often spread directly into the central nervous system, causing one of the common forms of meningitis.

Staphylococci and streptococci are common causes of skin diseases. Boils and impetigo (in which the skin is covered with blisters, pustules, and yellow crusts) may be caused by either. Staphylococci also can cause a severe skin infection that strips the outer skin layers off the body and leaves the underlayers exposed, as in severe burns, a condition known as toxic epidermal necrolysis. Streptococcal organisms can cause a severe condition known as necrotizing fasciitis, commonly referred to as flesh-eating disease, which has a fatality rate between 25 and 75 percent. Streptococci can be the cause of the red cellulitis of the skin known as erysipelas.

Some staphylococci produce an intestinal toxin and cause food poisoning. Certain streptococci settling in the throat produce a reddening toxin that speeds through the bloodstream and produces the symptoms of scarlet fever. Streptococci and staphylococci also can cause toxic shock syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is fatal in some 35 percent of cases.

Meningococci are fairly common inhabitants of the throat, in most cases causing no illness at all. As the number of healthy carriers increases in any population, however, there is a tendency for the meningococcus to become more invasive. When an opportunity is presented, it can gain access to the bloodstream, invade the central nervous system, and cause meningococcal meningitis (formerly called cerebrospinal meningitis or spotted fever). Meningococcal meningitis, at one time a dreaded and still a very serious disease, usually responds to treatment with penicillin if diagnosed early enough. When meningococci invade the bloodstream, some gain access to the skin and cause bloodstained spots, or purpura. If the condition is diagnosed early enough, antibiotics can clear the bloodstream of the bacterium and prevent any from getting far enough to cause meningitis. Sometimes the septicemia takes a mild, chronic, relapsing form with no tendency toward meningitis; this is curable once it is diagnosed. The meningococcus also can cause one of the most fulminating of all forms of septicemia, meningococcemia, in which the body is rapidly covered with a purple rash, purpura fulminans; in this form the blood pressure becomes dangerously low, the heart and blood vessels are affected by shock, and the infected person dies within a matter of hours. Few are saved, despite treatment with appropriate drugs.

Haemophilus influenzae is a microorganism named for its occurrence in the sputum of patients with influenza—an occurrence so common that it was at one time thought to be the cause of the disease. It is now known to be a common inhabitant of the nose and throat that may invade the bloodstream, producing meningitis, pneumonia, and various other diseases. In children it is the most common cause of acute epiglottitis, an infection in which tissue at the back of the tongue becomes rapidly swollen and obstructs the airway, creating a potentially fatal condition. H. influenzae also is the most common cause of meningitis and pneumonia in children under five years of age, and it is known to cause bronchitis in adults. The diagnosis is established by cultures of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or other tissue from sites of infection. Antibiotic therapy is generally effective, although death from sepsis or meningitis is still common. In developed countries where H. influenza vaccine is used, there has been a great decrease in serious infections and deaths.

Chlamydia are intracellular organisms found in many vertebrates, including birds and humans and other mammals. Clinical illnesses are caused by the species C. trachomatis, which is a frequent cause of genital infections in women. If an infant passes through an infected birth canal, it can produce disease of the eye (conjunctivitis) and pneumonia in the newborn. Young children sometimes develop ear infections, laryngitis, and upper respiratory tract disease from Chlamydia. Such infections can be treated with erythromycin. Another chlamydial organism, Chlamydophila psittaci, produces psittacosis, a disease that results from exposure to the discharges of infected birds. The illness is characterized by high fever with chills, a slow heart rate, pneumonia, headache, weakness, fatigue, muscle pains, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. The diagnosis is usually suspected if the patient has a history of exposure to birds. It is confirmed by blood tests. Mortality is rare, and specific antibiotic treatment is available.",mainstream
50,"Western media and Democratic Party politicians have made a major campaign accusing Russia of “meddling” in the U.S. election, colluding with and helping Trump win the Presidency. The charges began as “allegations” but now are routinely asserted as facts. The Washington Post recently ran a long article claiming all the above plus saying the operation was directed by Russian President Putin himself and implying not enough has been done to “punish” Russia. The July-August 2017 edition of Mother Jones magazine features an article headlined “The Russian Connection: Collusion? Maybe. Active Enablers? Definitely. Trump Knew the Truth, but he Remained on the Side of the Enemy.”

Is this campaign based on facts or political opportunism? Does it help or hurt the progressive cause of peace with justice? Following are major problems with the “anti-Russia” theme, starting with the lack of clear evidence.

Accusations that Russia stole and released the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails are based on the findings of the private company Crowdstrike. The DNC did not allow the FBI to scan the computers but relied on a hired private company which claims to have found telltale Russian alphabet characters (cyrrilic) in the computer memory. However, Crowdstrike is known to be political biased, connected to the Clintons and to make false accusations such as this one documented by Voice of America. Recently the Wikileaks “Vault7” findings reveal that the CIA has developed software which purposely leaves foreign language characters in memory, casting further doubt on the Crowdstrike evidence.

The accusations of Trump-Russia collusion, Putin direction etc are significantly based on the so-called “Steele Dossier”. This is the 35 page compilation of “intelligence reports” produced by a former MI6 officer, Robert Steele. The research and reports by Steele were contracted by anti-Trump Republicans in the primary race, then by the Clinton campaign in the presidential race. There is no supporting evidence or verification of the claims; the reports are essentially that a Kremlin source says such-and-such. It has since been revealed that Steele was not in direct contact but collected the information via Russians in the UK who in turn received it from Kremlin insiders. The reports were viewed skeptically by media, politicians and the intelligence community through the summer and fall of 2016. But then, just prior to the election, the dossier was leaked to the public with sensational stories of “golden showers” by prostitutes urinating at Trump’s request to “defile” the bed where the Obamas previously slept. Is the Steele dossier accurate or was it a PR dirty trick designed to damage Trump? The latter seems at least if not more likely. This Newsweek article, “Thirteen things that don’t add up in the Russia-Trump intelligence dossier”, lists some of the reasons to be skeptical.

3) The “assessment” from Intel Agencies gives no evidence and seems politically biased.

On 6 January 2017 the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) released a 14 page document titled “Background to ‘Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections”. The report says Russian President Putin ordered a campaign including cyber activity along with “overt efforts” to influence the election through official media (RT) and social media. Half of the report (7 pages) is devoted to describing the effectiveness and growth of Russian sponsored media known as “RT”. The report gives no evidence, acknowledging that is “does not and cannot include the full supporting information, including specific intelligence and sources and methods”. Should this report be accepted uncritically? Not if you consider past performance. The CIA has long history of deception and disinformation. “Intelligence” is sometimes directed to support political goals. One clear example is the false claims about Iraq that led to the U.S. invasion in 2003. In addition, the intelligence leadership is known to lie under oath. For example, DNI Director James Clapper lied in his testimony before Congress regarding the extent of monitoring and recording private communications of American citizens. The truth was later revealed by Edward Snowden. In short, there is no good reason to uncritically accept the statements and assertions of the U.S. intelligence community. There is every reason to be skeptical and require credible and verifiable evidence. This is compounded by the conflict between Trump and the intelligence agencies where they may be seeking retribution against him. Even Democratic Senator Schumer warned Trump about the dangers of bucking the CIA and other agencies: “They have seven ways to Sunday to get back at you.” What better way than shining a bright light on the Steele dossier and giving credence to the third hand accusations? It has recently been acknowledged by the NY Times that the assessment was made by four not seventeen intelligence agencies. DNI Director Clapper has admitted the assessment was by a hand picked group of analysts. Finally, it is significant that the NSA would only grant “moderate confidence” to the accusation that “Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances”. By their own definition on page 13, moderate confidence means that the information is “plausible but not of sufficient quality or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence.”

4) The counter-evidence seems stronger and more factual.

Veteran intelligence professionals, including a former technical director of the NSA, say the DNC email release was caused by a leak not a “hack”. The distinction is important: a hack is done over the internet; a leak is done transferring files onto a memory stick with little or no record. VIPS believes the emails were taken by an insider who transferred the files onto a thumb drive. If the files had been transferred over the internet, the National Security Agency (NSA) would have a record of that since virtually every packet is stored. In addition, the publisher of the DNC and Podesta emails, Wikileaks, says they did not receive the emails from Russia. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has offered a reward for the discovery of the murderer of Seth Rich, the young DNC Director of Voter Expansion who was mysteriously murdered on July 22. When asked if Seth Rich was the source of the DNC emails, he does not reply directly but it is implied. In addition, the former UK Ambassador Craig Murray has suggested that he was involved in a later (Podesta) transfer of the files from Washington DC to Wikileaks. Meanwhile, there appears to be an effort to discredit and denigrate research or investigation into the Seth Rich theory. If DNC insiders such as Seth Rich transferred the emails to Wikileaks, the anti-Russia campaign collapses.

Since Trump’s November victory, there have been accusations of “Russian interference” in European elections. But in each case, subsequent investigation shows the opposite. In Germany, France and the UK, security services found no evidence in contrast with the reports. The French security chief dismissed the claims of the Macron campaign saying the hack“was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone.”

5) The purported “crimes” have been wildly inflated.

The leaking of DNC and Podesta emails has been inflated into an “attack on US democracy” and “act of war”. Not to be outdone in the hyperbole department, the Washington Post article calls this “the crime of the century”. It’s quite astounding; even if Russia was guilty of hacking the DNC servers and promoting anti-Clinton campaign on social media, which is debatable, the notion that this was an “act of war” is preposterous. These events were secondary problems for the Clinton campaign. The FBI closing and then re-opening the criminal investigation of Clinton’s use of her private computers for public work was a bigger factor. There are many real problems with the democratic process in the USA and talking about them, whether on RT or elsewhere, is good not bad. Even a former U.S. President, Jimmy Carter, questions whether the U.S. is a democracy saying,

6) The anti-Russia hysteria has reduced resistance to reactionary changes in domestic policy.

There is an immediate need to build maximum opposition to Trump policies including the loss of net neutrality, increase in military spending, reductions in environmental protection, education and health care budgets, etc.. The anti-Russia and “hate Trump” campaigns have reduced the credibility of liberals and progressives with conservatives and make it harder to build resistance to changes which hurt the working class and poor.

7) The DNC and Podesta leaks were not bad; they were good.

Far from being an “attack on democracy”, the leaks of DNC and Podesta emails were positive. They exposed that the DNC itself was preventing the will of Democratic Party members in choosing their candidate. The releases exposed how the Democratic National Committee (DNC) leadership conspired and acted to boost Clinton and pr

event a successful challenge by Sanders. If there was an “attack on democracy” it was by the DNC leadership itself not the public release of authentic emails.

8) Social media criticizing Clinton was not bad; much of the criticism was accurate.

The intelligence agency assessment blames Russia for undermining “public faith in the US democratic process”, denigrating Secretary Clinton and harming “her electability and potential presidency”. They suggest Russia was responsible for anti-Clinton online messages, tweets, facebook posts, etc.. This is silly. It was predictable that Hillary Clinton would generate a lot of opposition during the Presidential campaign. She is a magnet for right and left wing criticism. She is strongly disliked by many progressives for good and real reasons. From her aggressive and warlike foreign policy to the horrible role of the Clinton Foundation in Haiti, there are many deep and profound things to criticize. Social media was alive with tweets, pages, posts and campaigns against Clinton. It is self-deception to think this was initiated or controlled in any substantial way by Moscow. The criticism and opposition to Hillary Clinton was sincere and home grown. While some criticism may have been undeserved, much of the criticism of Clinton was accurate and well founded.

9) The anti-Russia hysteria distracts from an objective evaluation of why the Democratic Party lost.

Instead of doing an honest and objective assessment of the election failure, the Democratic Party has invested enormous time and resources in promoting the narrative of Russian “meddling” and collusion with Trump. If they want to regain popularity, they need to review their leadership which has changed very little in over 15 years. They need to re-assess unpopular policies and their prioritization of Wall Street. If the DNC had run a clean primary race, Sanders probably would have prevailed over Clinton in the primary race and gone on to beat Donald Trump for president. The Democratic Party leadership has nobody to blame but themselves for their defeat.

10) The anti-Russia hysteria reduces resistance to neoconservative forces pushing for more war. Neoconservatives and the military industrial complex are campaigning for another war in the Middle East. The immediate flashpoint is Syria where the Syrian government and allies are making slow but steady progress defeating tens of thousands of foreign funded extremists. In response, the US and allies are escalating intervention and aggression trying to prolong the conflict and/or grab territory to block a Syrian victory. The situation is potentially disastrous with the neocons threatening war on Iran and even Russia. The Democratic and liberal hysteria around Russia has confused huge numbers of people about the situation who now think Russia is the ‘enemy’. The anti-Russia hysteria is leading liberals to ally with the CIA and war hawks instead of confronting them as the danger of confrontation keeps rising.

Democrats and liberals in the U.S. are making a huge mistake uncritically accepting and promoting the anti-Russia demonization. The accusations of Russian “meddling” are either exaggerated or false. There is an urgent need to resist Trump’s assault on positive domestic policies and oppose the slide towards a new war in the Middle East. If this is not stopped, there is a real risk of global and possibly nuclear war.",conspiracy
692,"Dr. Andrew Kaufman may be the most censored doctor in the U.S. right now. His videos are removed and censored from YouTube very quickly.

Dr. Kaufman is so intelligent, and so articulate, that the “mainstream” media and medical authorities obviously fear him and his message, and they are doing everything in their power to suppress him.

This video (below) he did with Spiro Skouras, for example, was immediately removed from YouTube, although Spiro’s other videos remain for the most part (for now).

Andrew Kaufman is a medical doctor. Here is his full bio from his website:

He completed his psychiatric training at Duke University Medical Center after graduating from the Medical University of South Carolina, and has a B.S. from M.I.T. in Molecular Biology.

He has conducted and published original research and lectured, supervised, and mentored medical students, residents, and fellows in all psychiatric specialties.

He has been qualified as an expert witness in local, state, and federal courts. He has held leadership positions in academic medicine and professional organizations.

He ran a start-up company to develop a medical device he invented and patented.

 In this interview with Spiro Skouras, you will most likely learn things you have never heard before about the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Kaufman will explain why this is all planned, and is not really about a dangerous virus at all, but a way to control people’s lives.

He will explain things about the new type of vaccine they are rushing so fast to develop, and what he believes is the real objective for this vaccine.

Dr. Kaufman has already paid a steep price to be a whistle blower, and he only expects it to get worse.

This is the only important thing for me to do now, is to get this information out, so that we can prevent ourselves from living in a horrible, horrible future.

I have two young children, and they are my main motivating factor, that I don’t want them to live in a world where they have no freedom. And that’s where we’re heading right now.

And so whatever risks there are, they’re risks that I simply have to take. That’s why I am doing what I am doing.

There have been things that have occurred. I have had consequences. I was let go from my regular psychiatry job because I refused to wear a mask.

I have had several friends who are doctors or other health care professionals who have been very upset with me. (They’re) disappointed and won’t talk to me anymore.

I knew that those risks were part of this. But that’s not what’s important.

I’ll tell you that I would be happy to risk being taken to jail as well, because I’m not going to participate in any of these measures.

I respect other people’s rights to make their own choices. So I don’t go and get in people’s faces.

But if anyone is willing to make eye contact and interact with me, I don’t observe any social distancing, (and so) any opportunity to hug someone, especially in public, I always take advantage of that, because I want to show people that actually all of these measures are really voluntary.

Even Governor Cuomo has made a public statement that there’s nothing that they can do to enforce any of these measures and that they are voluntary.

And I would like to encourage other people to make that decision, because if we rely on the authority to give us approval of how to exercise our freedom, they’re going to take more freedoms away, as they’ve been doing.

So while I respect people that to go and protest at the City Hall or State Capital, they are coming from the right point of view, they’re just asking the authority figures, the government, to give them permission, when they don’t need permission from the government.

They already have permission because they have inalienable rights.

It’s not really a decision for me. It’s just what I feel that I have to do to preserve the way of life that I want to live for me and my children.

1051,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen holds a press conference on the EU response to the COVID-19 crisis at the EU headquarters in Brussels on April 15, 2020.

Celebrities, world leaders and philanthropists pledged some 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion) on Monday for research into coronavirus vaccines, treatments and testing during an EU-led videoconference that was snubbed by the United States.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who hosted the conference, said a vaccine was the best chance of beating the COVID-19 disease, which has so far killed nearly a quarter of a million people around the world -- 140,000 of them in Europe.

Major European powers, along with Japan and Canada, made the biggest pledges but the lack of US representation raised the prospect of an uncoordinated competition to develop and produce a vaccine.

Some wealthy American individuals did take part, and pop star Madonna's million-dollar contribution was feted by EU officials.

The conference narrowly missed its target of 7.5 billion euros -- although a handful of contributors did not put a sum on their pledges -- but UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that much more would be needed, putting the final sum required near 38 billion euros.

""These funds are a kind of down payment for the development of new tools at the speed needed,"" Guterres told the conference. ""But to reach everyone everywhere we likely need five times that amount.""

Nonetheless, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the fundraising as a powerful show of ""global solidarity"".

The donations came from around 40 countries, the UN, research institutes and philanthropic bodies including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

But the initiative was undermined by the absence of the United States, with President Donald Trump at loggerheads with the WHO over its handling of the pandemic.

Trump -- fighting for reelection in November -- said on Sunday the United States would have a coronavirus vaccine ready by the end of the year.

His prediction was met with scepticism in some quarters, with Germany's Health Minister Jens Spahn warning it could take years for anyone to develop a vaccine.

While putting an upbeat gloss on the event in public, privately EU officials were disappointed the US did not take part.

""The EU responded favourably to a call for global action, the US refused. They are the ones who are isolating themselves,"" one official said.

""We're only at the start of the process. We hope the American government will join the common effort.""

A senior US official said Washington welcomed the telethon effort but insisted many of the organisations making pledges had already received substantial American support.

Pressed on why the United States was staying away, the official called the EU event ""one of many"" and said Washington was ""at the forefront of those international efforts"".

But other leaders are concerned that Trump's ""America First"" approach could lead to a counterproductive transatlantic race to find a vaccine and called instead for a collaborative approach.

While British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the world ""must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people"", his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe urged the international community to ""unite to overcome the crisis"".

French President Emmanuel Macron said it was vital that once a vaccine has been developed, it is treated as ""global public property"" with access available for ""the whole of the planet"".

In March, Germany was forced to insist that the rights to coronavirus vaccine research were not for sale after reports Trump wanted the US to buy exclusive access to one being developed by a German biotech firm.

In recent days the Trump administration has stepped up pressure on China, where the outbreak began, claiming it originated in a laboratory in the city of Wuhan.

Without mentioning Washington, China implicitly hit back at the donor conference, where it was represented by its ambassador to the EU.

""Multilateral cooperation in fighting the virus, confidence and solidarity are much more valuable than gold,"" ambassador Zhang Ming said. ""Panic and blame game are not useful at all.""

Isabelle Marchais of the Delors Institute thinktank said the US was ready to ""put all its forces into the battle"" to win a ""vaccine war"".

In an analysis published Monday, she said more than 100 vaccine research projects were going on, including eight clinical trials in the US, China and Europe.

""Given the stakes in the current pandemic, some companies -- particularly American and Chinese ones -- are ready to start production before the end of clinical trials in order to be the first ones to get the vaccine to market,"" she wrote.

Of the 7.5 billion euros, four billion will go on vaccine development, two billion on the search for a treatment and 1.5 billion for producing tests, the EU said.",mainstream
483,"Whether this seasons swine flu turns out to be deadly or mild, most experts agree that its only a matter of time before were hit by a truly devastating flu pandemicone that might kill more people worldwide than have died of the plague and aids combined. In the U.S., the main lines of defense are pharmaceuticalvaccines and antiviral drugs to limit the spread of flu and prevent people from dying from it. Yet now some flu experts are challenging the medical orthodoxy and arguing that for those most in need of protection, flu shots and antiviral drugs may provide little to none. So where does that leave us if a bad pandemic strikes?

Drive too fast along Red Lion Road, beside Philadelphias Northeast Airport, and you will miss the low-rise cement building where the biotech company MedImmune has been quietly pumping out swine flu vaccine at about a million doses a week. Through the summer and fall, workers wearing protective gear that covered them from head to toe brewed up batches of live, genetically modified flu virus. Robots then injected tiny doses of virus-laden fluid into glass vials, which were mounted into nasal spritzers, labeled, and readied for shipment at the direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, which is helping to coordinate the nations pandemic-preparedness plan. In the most ambitious vaccination program the nation has mounted since the anti-polio campaign in the 1950s, the federal government has commissioned MedImmune and four other companies to produce enough vaccine to cover the entire U.S. population.

Vaccination is central to the governments plan for preventing deaths from swine flu. The CDC has recommended that some 159 million adults and children receive either a swine flu shot or a dose of MedImmunes nasal vaccine this year. Shots are offered in doctors offices, hospitals, airports, pharmacies, schools, polling places, shopping malls, and big-box stores like Wal-Mart. In August, New York state required all health-care workers to get both seasonal and swine flu shots. To further protect the populace, the federal government has spent upwards of $3billion stockpiling millions of doses of antiviral drugs like Tamifluwhich are being used both to prevent swine flu and to treat those who fall ill.

But what if everything we think we know about fighting influenza is wrong? What if flu vaccines do not protect people from dyingparticularly the elderly, who account for 90 percent of deaths from seasonal flu? And what if the expensive antiviral drugs that the government has stockpiled over the past few years also have little, if any, power to reduce the number of people who die or are hospitalized? The U.S. governmentwith the support of leaders in the public-health and medical communitieshas put its faith in the power of vaccines and antiviral drugs to limit the spread and lethality of swine flu. Other plans to contain the pandemic seem anemic by comparison. Yet some top flu researchers are deeply skeptical of both flu vaccines and antivirals. Like the engineers who warned for years about the levees of New Orleans, these experts caution that our defenses may be flawed, and quite possibly useless against a truly lethal flu. And that unless we are willing to ask fundamental questions about the science behind flu vaccines and antiviral drugs, we could find ourselves, in a bad epidemic, as helpless as the citizens of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.

The term influenza, which dates back to the Middle Ages, is taken from the Italian word for occult or astral influence. Then as now, flu seemed to appear out of nowhere each winter, debilitating or killing large numbers of people, only to vanish in the spring. Today, seasonal flu is estimated to kill about 36,000 people in the United States each year, and half a million worldwide.

Yet the flu, in many important respects, remains mysterious. Determining how many deaths it really causes, or even who has it, is no simple matter. We think we have the flu anytime we fall ill with an ailment that brings on headache, malaise, fever, coughing, sneezing, and that achy feeling as if weve been sleeping on a bed of rocks, but researchers have found that at most half, and perhaps as few as 7 or 8 percent, of such cases are actually caused by an influenza virus in any given year. More than 200 known viruses and other pathogens can cause the suite of symptoms known as influenza-like illness; respiratory syncytial virus, bocavirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus are just a few of the bugs that can make a person feel rotten. And depending on the season, in up to two-thirds of the cases of flu-like illness, no cause at all can be found.

Nobody knows precisely why we are much more likely to catch the flu in the winter months than at other times of the year. Perhaps its because flu viruses flourish in cool temperatures and are killed by exposure to sunlight. Or maybe its because in winter, people spend more time indoors, where a sneeze or a cough can more easily spread a virus to others. What is certain is that influenza viruses mutate with amazing speed, so each flu season sees slightly different genetic versions of the viruses that infected people the year before. Every year, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect data from 94 nations on the flu viruses that circulated the previous year, and then make an educated guess about which viruses are likely to circulate in the coming fall. Based on that information, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issues orders to manufacturers in February for a vaccine that includes the three most likely strains.

Every once in a while, however, a very different bug pops up and infects far more people than the normal seasonal flu variants do. It is these novel viruses that are responsible for pandemics, defined by the World Health Organization as events that occur when a new influenza virus appears against which the human population has no immunity and which can sweep around the world in a very short time. The worst flu pandemic in recorded history was the Spanish flu of 191819, at the end of World WarI. A third of the worlds population was infected, with at least 40million and perhaps as many as 100million people dyingmore than were killed in World Wars I and II combined. (Some scholars suggest that one reason World WarI ended was that so many soldiers were sick or dying from flu.) Since then, two other flu pandemics have occurred, in 1957 and 1968, neither of which was particularly lethal.

In August, the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology projected that this fall and winter, the swine flu, H1N1, could infect anywhere between one-third and one-half of the U.S. population and could kill as many as 90,000 Americans, two and a half times the number killed in a typical flu season. But precisely how deadly, or even how infectious, this years H1N1 pandemic will turn out to be wont be known until its over. Most reports coming from the Southern Hemisphere in late August (the end of winter there) suggested that the swine flu is highly infectious, but not particularly lethal. For example, Australian officials estimated they would finish winter with under 1,000 swine flu deathsfewer than the usual 1,500 to 3,000 from seasonal flu. Among those who have died in the U.S., about 70 percent were already suffering from congenital conditions like cerebral palsy or underlying illnesses such as cancer, asthma, or AIDS, which make people more vulnerable.

Public-health officials consider vaccine their most formidable defense against the pandemicindeed, against any fluand on the surface, their faith seems justified. Vaccines developed over the course of the 20th century slashed the death rates of nearly a dozen infectious diseases, such as smallpox and polio, and vaccination became one of medicines most potent weapons. Influenza virus was first identified in the 1930s, and by the mid-1940s, researchers had produced a vaccine that was given to soldiers in World WarII. The U.S. government got serious about promoting flu vaccine after the 1957 flu pandemic brought home influenzas continuing potential to cause widespread illness and death. Today, flu vaccine is a staple of public-health policy; in a normal year, some 100 million Americans get vaccinated.

But while vaccines for, say, whooping cough and polio clearly and dramatically reduced death rates from those diseases, the impact of flu vaccine has been harder to determine. Flu comes and goes with the seasons, and often it does not kill people directly, but rather contributes to death by making the body more susceptible to secondary infections like pneumonia or bronchitis. For this reason, researchers studying the impact of flu vaccination typically look at deaths from all causes during flu season, and compare the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.

Such comparisons have shown a dramatic difference in mortality between these two groups: study after study has found that people who get a flu shot in the fall are about half as likely to die that winterfrom any causeas people who do not. Get your flu shot each year, the literature suggests, and you will dramatically reduce your chance of dying during flu season.

Yet in the view of several vaccine skeptics, this claim is suspicious on its face. Influenza causes only a small minority of all deaths in the U.S., even among senior citizens, and even after adding in the deaths to which flu might have contributed indirectly. When researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases included all deaths from illnesses that flu aggravates, like lung disease or chronic heart failure, they found that flu accounts for, at most, 10 percent of winter deaths among the elderly. So how could flu vaccine possibly reduce total deaths by half? Tom Jefferson, a physician based in Rome and the head of the Vaccines Field at the Cochrane Collaboration, a highly respected international network of researchers who appraise medical evidence, says: For a vaccine to reduce mortality by 50 percent and up to 90 percent in some studies means it has to prevent deaths not just from influenza, but also from falls, fires, heart disease, strokes, and car accidents. Thats not a vaccine, thats a miracle.

The estimate of 50 percent mortality reduction is based on cohort studies, which compare death rates in large groups, or cohorts, of people who choose to be vaccinated, against death rates in groups who dont. But people who choose to be vaccinated may differ in many important respects from people who go unvaccinatedand those differences can influence the chance of death during flu season. Education, lifestyle, income, and many other confounding factors can come into play, and as a result, cohort studies are notoriously prone to bias. When researchers crunch the numbers, they typically try to factor out variables that could bias the results, but, as Jefferson remarks, you can adjust for the confounders you know about, not for the ones you dont, and researchers cant always anticipate what factors are likely to be important to whether a patient dies from flu. There is always the chance that they might miss some critical confounder that renders their results entirely wrong.

When Lisa Jackson, a physician and senior investigator with the Group Health Research Center, in Seattle, began wondering aloud to colleagues if maybe something was amiss with the estimate of 50 percent mortality reduction for people who get flu vaccine, the response she got sounded more like doctrine than science. People told me, No good can come of [asking] this, she says. Potentially a lot of bad could happen for me professionally by raising any criticism that might dissuade people from getting vaccinated, because of course, We know that vaccine works. This was the prevailing wisdom.

Nonetheless, in 2004, Jackson and three colleagues set out to determine whether the mortality difference between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated might be caused by a phenomenon known as the healthy user effect. They hypothesized that on average, people who get vaccinated are simply healthier than those who dont, and thus less liable to die over the short term. People who dont get vaccinated may be bedridden or otherwise too sick to go get a shot. They may also be more likely to succumb to flu or any other illness, because they are generally older and sicker. To test their thesis, Jackson and her colleagues combed through eight years of medical data on more than 72,000 people 65 and older. They looked at who got flu shots and who didnt. Then they examined which groups members were more likely to die of any cause when it was not flu season.

Jacksons findings showed that outside of flu season, the baseline risk of death among people who did not get vaccinated was approximately 60 percent higher than among those who did, lending support to the hypothesis that on average, healthy people chose to get the vaccine, while the frail elderly didnt or couldnt. In fact, the healthy-user effect explained the entire benefit that other researchers were attributing to flu vaccine, suggesting that the vaccine itself might not reduce mortality at all. Jacksons papers are beautiful, says Lone Simonsen, who is a professor of global health at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., and an internationally recognized expert in influenza and vaccine epidemiology. They are classic studies in epidemiology, they are so carefully done.

The results were also so unexpected that many experts simply refused to believe them. Jacksons papers were turned down for publication in the top-ranked medical journals. One flu expert who reviewed her studies for the Journal of the American Medical Association wrote, To accept these results would be to say that the earth is flat! When the papers were finally published in 2006, in the less prominent International Journal of Epidemiology, they were largely ignored by doctors and public-health officials. The answer I got, says Jackson, was not the right answer.

The history of flu vaccination suggests other reasons to doubt claims that it dramatically reduces mortality. In 2004, for example, vaccine production fell behind, causing a 40 percent drop in immunization rates. Yet mortality did not rise. In addition, vaccine mismatches occurred in 1968 and 1997: in both years, the vaccine that had been produced in the summer protected against one set of viruses, but come winter, a different set was circulating. In effect, nobody was vaccinated. Yet death rates from all causes, including flu and the various illnesses it can exacerbate, did not budge. Sumit Majumdar, a physician and researcher at the University of Alberta, in Canada, offers another historical observation: rising rates of vaccination of the elderly over the past two decades have not coincided with a lower overall mortality rate. In 1989, only 15 percent of people over age 65 in the U.S. and Canada were vaccinated against flu. Today, more than 65 percent are immunized. Yet death rates among the elderly during flu season have increased rather than decreased.

Vaccine proponents call Majumdars last observation an ecological fallacy, because he fails, in their view, to consider changes in the larger environment that could have boosted death rates over the yearseven as rising vaccination rates were doing their part to keep mortality in check. The proponents suggest, for instance, that influenza viruses may have become more contagious over time, and thus are infecting greater numbers of elderly people, including some who have been vaccinated. Or maybe the viruses are becoming more lethal. Or maybe the elderly have less immunity to flu than they once did because, say, their diets have changed.

Or maybe vaccine just doesnt prevent deaths in the elderly. Of course, thats the one possibility that vaccine adherents wont consider. Nancy Cox, the CDCs influenza division chief, says flatly, The flu vaccine is the best way to protect against flu. Anthony Fauci, a physician and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH, where much of the basic science of flu vaccine has been worked out, says, I have no doubt that it is effective in conferring some degree of protection. To say otherwise is a minority view.

Majumdar says, We keep coming up against the belief that weve reduced mortality by 50 percent, and when researchers poke holes in the evidence, people pound the pulpit.

The most vocaland undoubtedly most vexingcritic of the gospel of flu vaccine is the Cochrane Collaborations Jefferson, whos also an epidemiologist trained at the famed London School of Tropical Hygiene, and who, in Lisa Jacksons view, makes other skeptics seem moderate by comparison. Among his fellow flu researchers, Jeffersons outspokenness has made him something of a pariah. At a 2007 meeting on pandemic preparedness at a hotel in Bethesda, Maryland, Jefferson, whod been invited to speak at the conference, was not greeted by any of the colleagues milling about the lobby. He ate his meals in the hotel restaurant alone, surrounded by scientists chatting amiably at other tables. He shrugs off such treatment. As a medical officer working for the United Nations in 1992, during the siege of Sarajevo, he and other peacekeepers were captured and held for more than a month by militiamen brandishing AK-47s and reeking of alcohol. Professional shunning seems trivial by comparison, he says.

Tom Jefferson has taken a lot of heat just for saying, Heres the evidence: its not very good, says Majumdar. The reaction has been so dogmatic and even hysterical that youd think he was advocating stealing babies. Yet while other flu researchers may not like what Jefferson has to say, they cannot ignore the fact that he knows the flu-vaccine literature better than anyone else on the planet. He leads an international team of researchers who have combed through hundreds of flu-vaccine studies. The vast majority of the studies were deeply flawed, says Jefferson. Rubbish is not a scientific term, but I think its the term that applies. Only four studies were properly designed to pin down the effectiveness of flu vaccine, he says, and two of those showed that it might be effective in certain groups of patients, such as school-age children with no underlying health issues like asthma. The other two showed equivocal results or no benefit.

Flu researchers have been fooled into thinking vaccine is more effective than the data suggest, in part, says Jefferson, by the imprecision of the statistics. The only way to know if someone has the fluas opposed to influenza-like illnessis by putting a Q-tip into the patients throat or nose and running a test, which simply isnt done that often. Likewise, nobody really has a handle on how many of the deaths that are blamed on flu were actually caused by a flu virus, because few are confirmed by a laboratory. I used to be a family physician, says Jefferson. Ive never seen a patient come to my office with H1N1 written on his forehead. When an old person dies of respiratory failure after an influenza-like illness, they nearly always get coded as influenza.

Theres one other way flu researchers may be fooled into thinking flu vaccine is effective, Jefferson says. All vaccines work by delivering a dose of killed or weakened virus or bacteria, which provokes the immune system into producing antibodies. When the person is subsequently exposed to the real thing, the body is already prepared to repel the bug completely or to get rid of it after a mild illness. Flu researchers often use antibody response as a way of gauging the effectiveness of vaccine, on the assumption that levels of antibodies in the blood of people who have been vaccinated are a good predictoralthough an imperfect oneof how well they can ward off the infection.

Theres some merit to this reasoning. Unfortunately, the very people who most need protection from the flu also have immune systems that are least likely to respond to vaccine. Studies show that young, healthy people mount a glorious immune response to seasonal flu vaccine, and their response reduces their chances of getting the flu and may lessen the severity of symptoms if they do get it. But they arent the people who die from seasonal flu. By contrast, the elderly, particularly those over age70, dont have a good immune response to vaccineand theyre the ones who account for most flu deaths. (Infants with severe disabilities, such as leukemia and congenital lung disease, and people who are immune-compromisedfrom AIDS, or diabetes, or cancer treatmentmake up the rest. As of August8, only 36 deaths from swine flu had been confirmed among children in the U.S., and the overwhelming majority of those children had multiple, severe health disorders.)

In Jeffersons view, this raises a troubling conundrum: Is vaccine necessary for those in whom it is effective, namely the young and healthy? Conversely, is it effective in those for whom it seems to be necessary, namely the old, the very young, and the infirm? These questions have led to the most controversial aspect of Jeffersons work: his call for placebo-controlled trials, studies that would randomly give half the test subjects vaccine and the other half a dummy shot, or placebo. Only such large, well-constructed, randomized trials can show with any precision how effective vaccine really is, and for whom.

In the flu-vaccine world, Jeffersons call for placebo-controlled studies is considered so radical that even some of his fellow skeptics oppose it. Majumdar, the Ottawa researcher, says he believes that evidence of a benefit among children is established and that public-health officials should try to protect seniors by immunizing children, health-care workers, and other people around them, and thus reduce the spread of the flu. Lone Simonsen explains the prevailing view: It is considered unethical to do trials in populations that are recommended to have vaccine, a stance that is shared by everybody from the CDCs Nancy Cox to Anthony Fauci at the NIH. They feel strongly that vaccine has been shown to be effective and that a sham vaccine would put test subjects at unnecessary risk of getting a serious case of the flu. In a phone interview, Fauci at first voiced the opinion that a placebo trial in the elderly might be acceptable, but he called back later to retract his comment, saying that such a trial would be unethical. Jefferson finds this view almost exactly backward: What do you do when you have uncertainty? You test, he says. We have built huge, population-based policies on the flimsiest of scientific evidence. The most unethical thing to do is to carry on business as usual.

Just after 6 p.m. on a warm Friday evening in July, Dr. David Newman is only minutes into a 10-hour shift in the emergency room of New York Citys St. Lukes Hospital, and already he has assumed responsibility for 11 patients. The young Italian tourist sitting on the bed in front of the doctor has meningitis, and through an interpreter, Newman tells him he almost certainly has the viral form of the disease, which will do nothing more than make him feel ill for a few days. There is a tiny chance, says Newman, that the illness is caused by a bacterium, which can be deadly, but he is almost positive thats not what the tourist has. He says to his patient, I cant tell you with 100 percent certainty that you dont have it, but if you do, youll begin to feel worse and youll need to come back. The tourist, on learning that he might be infected with a potentially lethal disease, looks down at his feet and confesses that he is much more worried about another illness: swine flu. Newman smiles patiently. It would be nice if you had swine flu, he says. Compared to bacterial meningitis, swine flu is safe.

Late last spring, as headlines and airwaves warned of a possible pandemic, patients like Newmans began clogging emergency rooms across the country, a sneezing, coughing, infectious tide of humanity more worried than truly sick, but whose mere presence in the emergency room has endangered the lives of others. Studies show that when there is ER crowding, mortality goes up, because patients who need immediate attention dont get it, says Newman, the director of clinical research in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the hospital, which is affiliated with Columbia University. In an average year the ER at St. Lukes, a sprawling 1,076-bed hospital on 113th Street, takes in 110,000 patients, some 300 a day. At the height of the summer swine flu outbreak, that number doubled. The vast majority of panicky patients who came in the door at St. Lukes and other emergency departments didnt actually have the virus, and of those who did, most were not sick enough to need hospitalization. Even so, says Newman, when patients with even mild flu symptoms show up in the hospital, they vastly increase the spread of the virus, simply because they inevitably sneeze and cough in rooms that are jammed with other people.

Many of the worried sick come to St. Lukes and other hospitals in search of antiviral drugs. The CDC recommends the use of two drugs against H1N1: oseltamivir and zanamivir, better known by their brand names, Tamiflu and Relenza, which together form the second pillar of the governments anti-pandemic-flu strategy. Public-health officials at the state and local levels are also recommending the drugs. Guidelines issued by the New York City Department of Health, says Newman, encourage us to give a prescription to just about every patient with the sniffles, a practice that some experts worry will quickly lead to resistant strains of the virus.

Indeed, thats already happening. Daniel Janies, an associate professor of biomedical informatics at Ohio State University, tracks the genetic mutations that allow flu virus to develop resistance to drugs. Flu can become resistant to Tamiflu in a matter of days, he says. Handing out the drug early in the pandemic, when H1N1 poses only a minimal threat to the vast majority of patients, strikes him as shortsighted. Indeed, samples of resistant H1N1 were cropping up by midsummer, increasing the likelihood that come late fall, many people will be infected with a resistant strain of swine flu. Alarmed at that prospect, the World Health Organization issued an alert on August 21, recommending that Tamiflu and Relenza be used only in severe cases and in patients who are at high risk of serious complications. By mid-August, two U.S. swine flu patients had developed Tamiflu-resistant strains.

The U.S. first began stockpiling Tamiflu and Relenza back in 2005, in the wake of concern that an outbreak in Southeast Asia of bird flu, a far more deadly form of the disease, might go global. On November 1, 2005, President George W.Bush pronounced pandemic flu a danger to our homeland, and he asked Congress to approve legislation that included $1billion for the production and stockpiling of antivirals. This was after Congress had already approved $1.8billion to stockpile Tamiflu for the military, a decision that was made during the tenure of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. (Before joining the Bush Cabinet, Rumsfeld was chairman for four years of Gilead Sciences, the company that holds the patent on Tamiflu, and he held millions of dollars worth of stock in the company. According to Roll Call, an online newspaper covering events on Capitol Hill, Rumsfeld says he recused himself from all government decisions involving Tamiflu. Gileads stock price rose more than 50 percent in 2005, when the governments plan was announced.)

As with vaccines, the scientific evidence for Tamiflu and Relenza is thin at best. In its general-information section, the CDCs Web site tells readers that antiviral drugs can make you feel better faster. True, but not by much. On average, Tamiflu (which accounts for 85 to 90 percent of the flu antiviral-drug market) cuts the duration of flu symptoms by 24hours in otherwise healthy people. In exchange for a slightly shorter bout of illness, as many as one in five people taking Tamiflu will experience nausea and vomiting. About one in five children will have neuropsychiatric side effects, possibly including anxiety and suicidal behavior. In Japan, where Tamiflu is liberally prescribed, the drug may have been responsible for 50 deaths from cardiopulmonary arrest, from 2001 to 2007, according to Rokuro Hama, the chair of the Japan Institute of Pharmacovigilance.

Such side effects might be worth risking if the antivirals prevented serious complications of flu, such as pneumonia, hospitalization, and death. Roche Laboratories, the company licensed to manufacture and market Tamiflu, says its drug does just that. In two September2006 press releases, the company announced, Tamiflu significantly reduces the risk of death from influenza: New data shows treatment was associated with more than a two third reduction in deaths, and Children with influenza [are] 53 percent less likely to contract pneumonia when treated with Tamiflu. Once again cohort studies (the same kind of potentially biased research that led to the conclusion that flu vaccine cuts mortality by 50 percent) are behind these claims. Tamiflu costs $10 a pill. It is possible that people who take it are more likely to be insured and affluent, or at least middle-class, than those who do not, and a large body of evidence shows that the well-off nearly always fare better than the poor when stricken with an infectious disease, including flu. In both 2003 and 2009, reviews of randomized placebo-controlled studies found that the study populations simply werent large enough to answer the question: Does Tamiflu prevent pneumonia?

As late as this August, the companys own Web site contained the following statement, which was written under the direction of the FDA: Tamiflu has not been proven to have a positive impact on the potential consequences (such as hospitalizations, mortality, or economic impact) of seasonal, avian, or pandemic influenza. An FDA spokesperson said recently that the agency is unaware of any data submitted by Roche that would support the claims in the companys September 2006 news release about the drugs reducing flu deaths.

Why, then, has the federal government stockpiled millions of doses of antivirals, at a cost of several billion dollars? And why are physicians being encouraged to hand out prescriptions to large numbers of people, without sound evidence that the drugs will help? The short answer may be that public-health officials feel they must offer something, and these drugs are the only possible remedies at hand. I have to agree with the critics the antiviral question is not cut-and-dried, says Fauci. But [these drugs are] the best we have. The CDCs Nancy Cox also acknowledges that the science is not as sound as she might like, but the government still recommends their use. And as with vaccines, she considers additional randomized placebo-controlled trials of the antiviral drugs to be unethical and thus out of the question.

This is the curious state of debate about the governments two main weapons in the fight against pandemic flu. At first, government officials declare that both vaccines and drugs are effective. When faced with contrary evidence, the adherents acknowledge that the science is not as crisp as they might wish. Then, in response to calls for placebo-controlled trials, which would provide clear results one way or the other, the proponents say such studies would deprive patients of vaccines and drugs that have already been deemed effective. We cant just let people die, says Cox.

Students of U.S. medical history will find this circular logic familiar: it is a long-recurring theme in American medicine, and one that has, on occasion, had deadly consequences. In 1925, Sinclair Lewis caricatured a medical culture that allowed beliefand profitsto distort science in his Pulitzer Prizewinning book, Arrowsmith. Based on the lives of the real-life microbiologists Paul de Kruif and Jacques Loeb, Lewis tells the story of Martin Arrowsmith, a physician who invents a new vaccine during a deadly outbreak of bubonic plague. But his efforts to test the vaccines efficacy are frustrated by an angry community that desperately wants to believe the vaccine works, and a profit-hungry institute that rushes the vaccine into use prematurelyforever preempting the proper studies that are needed.

The annals of medicine are littered with treatments and tests that became medical doctrine on the slimmest of evidence, and were then declared sacrosanct and beyond scientific investigation. In the 1980s and 90s, for example, cancer specialists were convinced that high-dose chemotherapy followed by a bone-marrow transplant was the best hope for women with advanced breast cancer, and many refused to enroll their patients in randomized clinical trials that were designed to test transplants against the standardand far less toxictherapy. The trials, they said, were unethical, because they knew transplants worked. When the studies were concluded, in 1999 and 2000, it turned out that bone-marrow transplants were killing patients. Another recent example involves drugs related to the analgesic lidocaine. In the 1970s, doctors noticed that the drugs seemed to make the heart beat rhythmically, and they began prescribing them to patients suffering from irregular heartbeats, assuming that restoring a proper rhythm would reduce the patients risk of dying. Prominent cardiologists for years opposed clinical trials of the drugs, saying it would be medical malpractice to withhold them from patients in a control group. The drugs were widely used for two decades, until a government-sponsored study showed in 1989 that patients who were prescribed the medicine were three and a half times as likely to die as those given a placebo.

Demonstrating the efficacy (or lack thereof) of vaccine and antivirals during flu season would not be hard to do, given the proper resources. Take a group of people who are at risk of getting the flu, and randomly assign half to get vaccine and the other half a dummy shot. Then count the people in each group who come down with flu, suffer serious illness, or die. (A similarly designed trial would suffice for the antivirals.) It might sound coldhearted, but it is the only way to know for certain whether, and for whom, current remedies actually work. It would also be useful to know whether vaccinating healthy peoplewho can mount an immune response on their ownprotects the more vulnerable people around them. For example, immunizing nursing-home staff and healthy children is thought to reduce the spread of flu to the elderly and the immune-compromised. Pinning down the effectiveness of this strategy would be a bit more complex, but not impossible.

In the absence of such evidence, we are left with two possibilities. One is that flu vaccine is in fact highly beneficial, or at least helpful. Solid evidence to that effect would encourage more citizensand particularly more health professionalsto get their shots and prevent the flus spread. As it stands, more than 50 percent of health-care workers say they do not intend to get vaccinated for swine flu and dont routinely get their shots for seasonal flu, in part because many of them doubt the vaccines efficacy. The other possibility, of course, is that were relying heavily on vaccines and antivirals that simply dont work, or dont work as well as we believe. And as a result, we may be neglecting other, proven measures that could minimize the death rate during pandemics.

Vaccines give us a false sense of security, says Sumit Majumdar. When you have a strategy that [everybody thinks] reduces death by 50 percent, its pretty hard to invest resources to come up with better remedies. For instance, health departments in every state are responsible for submitting plans to the CDC for educating the public, in the event of a serious pandemic, about hand-washing and social distancing (voluntary quarantines, school closings, and even enforcement of mandatory quarantines to keep infected people in their homes). Putting these plans into action will require considerable coordination among government officials, the media, and health-care workersand widespread buy-in from the public. Yet little discussion has appeared in the press to help people understand the measures they can take to best protect themselves during a flu outbreakother than vaccination and antivirals.

Launched early enough and continued long enough, social distancing can blunt the impact of a pandemic, says Howard Markel, a pediatrician and historian of medicine at the University of Michigan. Washing hands diligently, avoiding public places during an outbreak, and having a supply of canned goods and water on hand are sound defenses, he says. Such steps could be highly effective in helping to slow the spread of the virus. In Mexico, for instance, where the first swine flu cases were identified in March, the government launched an aggressive program to get people to wash their hands and exhorted those who were sick to stay home and effectively quarantine themselves. In the United Kingdom, the national health department is promoting a buddy program, encouraging citizens to find a friend or neighbor willing to deliver food and medicine so people who fall ill can stay home.

In the U.S., by contrast, our reliance on vaccination may have the opposite effect: breeding feelings of invulnerability, and leading some people to ignore simple measures like better-than-normal hygiene, staying away from those who are sick, and staying home when they feel ill. Likewise, our encouragement of early treatment with antiviral drugs will likely lead many people to show up at the hospital at first sniffle. Theres no worse place to go than the hospital during flu season, says Majumdar. Those who dont have the flu are more likely to catch it there, and those who do will spread it around, he says. But we dont tell people this.

All of which leaves open the question of what people should do when faced with a decision about whether to get themselves and their families vaccinated. There is little immediate danger from getting a seasonal flu shot, aside from a sore arm and mild flu-like symptoms. The safety of the swine flu vaccine remains to be seen. In the absence of better evidence, vaccines and antivirals must be viewed as only partial and uncertain defenses against the flu. And they may be mere talismans. By being afraid to do the proper studies now, we may be condemning ourselves to using treatments based on illusion and faith rather than sound science.

1097,"‘There is a cure’: California biotech company claims it has discovered an antibody that can block ‘100%’ of coronavirus infections

Scientists at a California biotech company have found an antibody that completely blocks coronavirus in a discovery they called a ‘cure,’ Fox News reported.

Sorrento Therapeutics, based in San Diego, claims its STI-1499 antibody stopped coronavirus from entering 100 percent of healthy human cells in petri dish experiments.

It’s one of several antibodies planned to be combined for a drug ‘cocktail’ Sorrento is developing in collaboration with Mt Sinai School of Medicine in New York.

In a press release, Sorrento said it could produce up to 200,000 doses of the antibody a month – a production timeline that would likely make the drug available months sooner than a COVID-19 vaccine is expected.

The company has filed for emergency approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but has not yet received the green light.

Stocks for Sorrento soared by nearly 220 percent on the heels of the announcement.

624,"Autism is on the rise and the statistics are skyrocketing. Back in 1990, less than 30 years ago, studies reveal there were roughly three autism cases per 10,000 children in the United States. Fast forward to this past Spring, 2018, when the CDC released new data revealing that one in every 59 American kids have some form of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with a much higher incident in boys than girls.

What changed so drastically in less than three decades that autism cases went from three per 10,000 to 170 per 10,000? Currently more than 20 million people worldwide are diagnosed with some form of autism.

Let’s take a super close look at possible factors and eliminate the “smoke and mirrors” created to distract us from unmasking the truth about autism spectrum disorder, a conundrum wrapped inside a paradox and lost in a labyrinth that medical doctors aren’t allowed to question or solve, only medicate with chemicals that add to the issues.

First things first, no child has ever been reported born with autism spectrum disorder, so the “inherited” genetics theory should be tossed out the window immediately.

Medical doctors love to blame parental genes so you won’t look for a cure, and so you will accept the condition as something permanent, requiring chemical medications for life.

Autism signs and symptoms emerge between 12 and 18 months of age, and issues with brain development often increase during the second year of life, when symptoms and functional difficulties begin to include speech delay, problems paying attention, inappropriate social interaction, repetitive movements, tics, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.

Most neurological afflictions arise from an overload of toxins in the body

Our cleansing organs have a very tough job: filter out all the toxins we consume, including those we eat, drink, breathe in, put on our skin, hair and nails, and those that are injected into our muscle tissue.

But how can our kidneys, liver, and pancreas do their filtration jobs if they are completely overwhelmed, confused, and constantly barraged with parasites, pathogens, heavy metal toxins, and genetically mutated organisms from other animals?

Let’s face it, the past thirty years have changed drastically for Americans, including the invasion of GMOs in food and medicine, pharmaceutical drugs including opiates, and a CDC-recommended schedule of 55 vaccines before age seven. Wow.

According to TruthWiki, Autism Spectrum Disorder is a broad umbrella term for Autism, Asperger (or Asperger’s) syndrome, and any other pervasive developmental, cognitive, behavioral, social communication or language disorder. Autism occurs when nerve cells and synapses in the brain are altered, blocked, disrupted and disturbed.

So the question resides: How do the brain and central nervous system become so violently disturbed after birth? Could it be all of that vaccine violence? The ASD spike perfectly coincides with the vaccine schedule increase and the rise of genetically modified organisms in food, which both catapulted in the early 1990s. Go figure.

Though the CDC lies and swears that mercury has been removed from all childhood vaccines, the flu shot is over-loaded with mercury and the CDC recommends the influenza vaccine to ALL pregnant women and all infants at 6 months of age. Wait, what?

Mercury is the second most poisonous element known to mankind, second only to uranium. It is a scientific FACT that human brain neurons permanently disintegrate in the presence of mercury within one hour of exposure.

Here comes the rub. Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative (about 50 percent mercury) and the World Health Organization warned about its use in vaccines way back in 1990.

Plus, mercury, an unstable metal, is a cumulative poison, meaning the body has difficulty removing it and it accumulates significantly over time. Does any pediatrician in America ever recommend testing infants for heavy metal poisoning? Nope.

Does any pediatrician or nurse in America read the vaccine insert and ingredients word for word to their patients and parents of newborns? Nope.

Horrific fact: Some infants receive more mercury in one day than the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends as a maximum for adults for three months worth of exposure.

Still, the maximum amount of mercury for any human to ingest should actually be zero. There is no safe amount of mercury for the human body, and to suggest that there is would be like setting a maximum amount of uranium intake, or plutonium, or cesium 137 (radio cesium), for that matter. We don’t even have time to talk about amalgam (mercury-loaded) dental fillings right now.

Vaccine Spectrum Disorder is reversible – Involves detoxification of heavy metal toxins, pesticides, and GMOs

Is your child, brother, aunt, uncle, sister, mother or father suffering from VSD right now? Maybe their central nervous system, brain, gut, and cleansing organs are polluted with mercury, embalming fluid (formaldehyde), aluminum, lead, pesticides, herbicides, fluoride, and GMOs.

How many kids with autism now will suffer from dementia later in life? There’s a statistic we need to know.

It’s time to question why Vaccine Spectrum Disorder barely existed before the 1990s. Before the 1990s, American staple foods like corn and soy weren’t infested with pesticide genes and coated with glyphosate (Roundup).

Humans weren’t using microwave ovens to nuke their food, and cancer-causing artificial sweeteners weren’t in everything labeled “diet” and “zero.” Today’s newborns, infants, toddlers and children are inundated with toxic food colorings, deadly flu shots and unnecessary booster vaccines.

Look into natural foods that pull heavy metal toxins out of the body, like chia seeds, cilantro, and chlorella.

Chlorella is an amazing microalgae superfood and detoxifier commonly used for colon cleansing because it binds to heavy metals and other toxic substances and removes them from the body safely and naturally.

Plus, probiotics also remove heavy metal toxins naturally — read more recent research to find out.

TRUE stories of recovery from Autism, plus significant injury settlements from vaccine damages

Feeling helpless after leaving some allopathic doctor’s office? You’re not alone. It’s time to visit a complementary and alternative medicine physician. These are doctors who investigate the causes of disease and disorder, then eradicate them, instead of simply medicating the symptoms with chemicals.

Could autism be a form of chronic mercury poisoning? The vaccine industry has spent $3.5 billion in private, secretive injury settlements to convince the rest of the country it’s not.

Maybe it’s time to take your loved one who’s suffering from VSD to a Naturopathic doctor who can test their blood and recommend the right nutrition, detoxification and supplementation regimen right away and from now on.

Think you can’t afford to go organic? Maybe you should sue the vaccine industry. Recent cases of vaccine injury settlement are published and you may need an attorney to help you fight the secretive vaccine court. Here are some attorneys in New York that have won millions of dollars for parents whose kids are suffering from VSD.",conspiracy
14,"WASHINGTON (AP) — America faces the “darkest winter in modern history” unless leaders act decisively to prevent a rebound of the coronavirus, says a government whistleblower who alleges he was ousted from his job after warning the Trump administration to prepare for the pandemic.

Immunologist Dr. Rick Bright, wearing a protective mask, testified Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aspects of his complaint about early administration handling of the crisis were expected to be backed up by testimony from an executive of a company that manufactures respirator masks.

A federal watchdog agency has found “reasonable grounds” that Bright was removed from his post as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority after sounding the alarm at the Department of Health and Human Services. Bright alleged he became a target of criticism when he urged early efforts to invest in vaccine development and stock up on supplies.

“Our window of opportunity is closing,” Bright said in his prepared testimony. “If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities.”

Bright’s testimony follows this week’s warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, that a rushed lifting of store-closing and stay-at-home restrictions could “turn back the clock,” seeding more suffering and death and complicating efforts to get the economy rolling again.

President Donald Trump on Thursday dismissed Bright in a tweet as “a disgruntled employee, not liked or respected by people I spoke to and who, with his attitude, should no longer be working for our government!” It’s a sentiment some of the president’s political allies have expressed about Fauci as well.

More than 84,000 people have died in the U.S., representing more than one-fourth of global deaths and the world’s highest toll, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. On the planet more than 4.3 million have been infected and about 298,000 have died.

Eager to restart the U.S. economy, Trump has been urging states to lift restrictions, and many governors are doing so gradually, though consumers remain leery of going back to restaurants, social events and sporting competitions.

In his prepared testimony, Bright said, “The undeniable fact is there will be a resurgence of (COVID-19) this fall, greatly compounding the challenges of seasonal influenza and putting an unprecedented strain on our health care system.”

“Without clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined, 2020 will be darkest winter in modern history,” Bright said.

The vaccine expert told Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Ct., a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, that government officials “could have done better” to take early action to address the coronavirus. Bright added that his efforts to push more swift response were “not responded to with action” and he was removed from key meetings on COVID-19 as a result of his urgency.

As part of his whistleblower complaint, Bright is seeking to be reinstated in his old job. HHS, his employer, says it strongly disagrees with his allegations and that it reassigned him to a high-profile position helping to lead the development of new coronavirus tests at the National Institutes of Health.

BARDA, the agency Bright worked at for 10 years, was created to help the government respond to bioterrorism, infectious diseases and radiological attacks. It focuses on developing and procuring counter-measures such as vaccines and treatments. Prior to his reassignment Bright had received an “outstanding” performance review.

He says friction with HHS leaders escalated after he opposed widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that Trump touted without proof as a “game-changer” for treating COVID-19 patients. Subsequent studies have indicated the drug may do more harm than good. Bright was summarily removed in late April.

One aspect of Bright’s complaint is expected to get backing at Thursday’s hearing from an executive of a Texas company that manufactures N95 respirator masks. Michael Bowen, executive vice president of Prestige Ameritech, emailed with Bright repeatedly starting in late January. Bowen offered to crank up production lines that were sitting idle, while warning that the world supply of masks was being snapped up by other countries. Bright said in his complaint that it took five weeks to move the federal bureaucracy.

In written testimony to the committee, Bowen said Bright and other BARDA directors he’d worked with previously all wanted to address a chronic problem of not enough masks in the government stockpile, “but in my opinion didn’t have enough authority.”

After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, America was told that restrictive “governmental ‘silos’ had been torn down … so that different federal agencies could work together for national security,” Bowen added. “But I didn’t see evidence of that.”",mainstream
